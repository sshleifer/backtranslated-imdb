I was so disappointed by this movie. I do not know much about the true story, so I was eager to see her play in a movie and learn about a small slice of history. With such a powerful story and great actors, it seemed like a perfect combination. Well, somewhere, the scenario failed them. It was so scattered - does this film speak to his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his ability to speak? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to integrate all these things into a good story, but this movie was not. It was cold to watch characters that were inimitable not because of their disability, but because of their personality. Other minor complaints include: 1. The heavy soundtrack. These are the seventies - we already get it! 2. If he is such a phenomenal speaker, why have not we received more than an excerpt here and there - and even then mostly in montages?
