This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We like musicals, but not this one. Despite the appalling sound quality, the mediocrity of the cinematography and the many actors who can neither sing nor dance, Anthony Rapp has managed to give a good performance (especially towards the end). The Marjorie character, a drunk woman, was nice to watch, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible vocals and cheezy piano music. Certainly, some songs (fantabulous) are rather catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it could be a good musical on stage (with great actors).
