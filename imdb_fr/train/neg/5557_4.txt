OK, but does that make this movie a good movie? Finally, not really, in my opinion.There is not much to recommend.I found it very slow, tedious, in fact.It is also quite predictable. The numbers one and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I also thought that this movie was sometimes quite fun, which I did not really think correspond to this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main role of the villain in this episode. he's a pretty decent actor, but I feel like he's played his character over there too. I guess it's the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I liked the movie. Moreover, there were very bad doubled. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but he does not have much work to do in this film. The character has not really evolved, as I hoped.oh well. It's just my opinion. not abyssal, it's pretty bad vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
