It may have been done for hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, the best thing about the whole DVD would be !!! I'm surprised people took the time to do something so bad and spend money on it too, I'm glad I only rented. I guess the real fans of this film should probably be sadistic and gothic to care about it without touching any effects of synthesis or other effect, I hope Alex Chandon learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to do a better film the future, that is to say if he is still at work. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers, this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!
