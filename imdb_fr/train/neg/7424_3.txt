The very ordinary movie film here with Stella Stevens taking the instructions of someone in disguise (it did not take me long to guess who it was) in the old city of Nevada outside of Vegas for a flight of Money at Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads his gang of three girls and finds out they have to act much faster than expected. Despite some nice looks on Las Vegas in the 70s, a very average but credible acting game among the most involved, and a plot with promising potential, Las Vegas Lady drops a big boring egg. It seems forever that the film goes into high gear and when it does, it just stammers here and there and never really accelerates. I was a little disappointed by this movie. Of course, I was not expecting anything awesome, but at least I thought it might be one of those 70s-style movies or whatever. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is a fight between Stuart Whitman and George DiCenzo, an unofficial one year before his big performance as Bugliosa Attorney in Helter Skelter. The shooting has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is a punch and a blow to the head with a blunt instrument. Beyond that, nothing in terms of action. And for girls, do not wait too much. Stella and her daughters (very mediocre but pretty talents, enter a sauna and a bath, what do we see, nothing more than a fleeting profile.) Stella is wearing these nice open blouses highlighting her true talents, but I would have liked that it might be a bit more open with her performance, so I could write something that would recommend the movie, but that should not be, and I have little say in favor of this film. is in no way a horrible movie, it's not adventure either.
