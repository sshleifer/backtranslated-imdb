Although, in many ways, I agree with the comments of other critics. I think the plot and the idea are very good. Many of the support actors were very good. The fatal problem of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen an "actor" as talented as me. I can not imagine how this person has ever been in a movie or on television. In my opinion, she would be better as a superior at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, ask the question ...... "Who knows she"? I would very much like this film to be redone with some talent. I do not blame the writer that the failure of this film is worth seeing.
