It is embarrassing for everyone and all that has served to make this joke. Personally, I do not care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or what so many people find fascinating about her. As a film, it would not even be possible to get a passing grade at the film school. The scenario is a mess, the acting is atrocious, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") did that makes me wonder what the hell he thought. He did "Old School" to shout loud! It does not even belong to the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please for some reason DO NOT WATCH THIS! I see that there is a comment that it's so bad that it's good, but it's frankly too nice. When will we stop seeing singers who obviously can not continue playing, I hope that ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some quality actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this slum. Regarding the plot, it is almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes, I know it's another rehearsal), I doubt that anyone will remember anything about it. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, regret the REAL actors involved to waste their time making this bomb. Jessica Simpson, you're pretty, but do not forget to sing, even though I'm not very fond of that either. And whoever did this movie, I would not put that on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give a zero.
