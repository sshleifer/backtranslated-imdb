Spoiler: group of passive-aggressive family reunited. The scenario makes them say and do things that people would never do, at least those who have the slightest decency. The hero falls in love with a woman whom he considers to be his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, unaware that she will present herself under the name of her brother's girlfriend at the meeting. He tries to rely on the request of his brother, but knowing that our hero likes it, she teases pitilessly. extended. At one point, she undresses and takes a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart is breaking. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she does not want a brother and leaves the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really hangs out. The public coughed and dragged on in the long run. The writing is unintelligent and incredible. We almost got out, but we kept thinking that something would happen that would make things better, but no. All the beautiful reviews must have been written by paid shills, to fool poor cupping like me by seeing shit like this. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers and theaters for leaving something so bad on the screen!
