"The Seventh Sign" borrows a lot from "Rosemary's Baby" and "Omen" (he actually mixes both stories). Even his title recalls the "seventh seal" of Bergman. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it starts pretty well, with all the omens scattered all over the world, and at the same time, an apparently - distinct - plot - where Moore's husband tries to save a poor boy (who killed his parents, brother and sister) of the death penalty.This time at a time, Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering Jew is involved), which sometimes makes the funny replicas sometimes funny (Are you ever went to Sunday school? But they taught me that God was love!). IMHO scene, is the short dialogue between the priest John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, a pity he did not have a more important role, because his casual game is priceless - and the young Jew. <br /> <Demi Moore probably expressed the same desire as her ex-husband Bruce Willis: save the world. She does not save the movie for all that.
