I already thought that "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie of all time ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed him in every way I could imagine and some that I could not. In "The Stoned Age", I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins", I hated the actors ... and all those who participated in the creation of this atrocity. I'm not going to include a teaser for this movie, I'm not so cruel. I could not subject such torment to innocents like you. In fact, any discussion of the plot about this film is insane and humiliating. The words I would like to use to describe this film are: tasteless, asin and naive. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, PLEASE, do not watch this movie. I beg you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE. For reasons of mental health and intellect, do not watch it. Destroy all the copies you encounter.
