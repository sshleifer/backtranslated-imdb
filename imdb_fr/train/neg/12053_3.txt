as always, it is an inaccurate image of the homeless. In the early '90s, television was telling a lot of lies about panhandler maneuvers and making everyone look bad. She claimed that we all earned more than $ 100 a day while $ 20 to $ 40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone passed by where I held a sign suggesting to work and offered me work, I would even take it if I could physically. And if I was offered the $ 100,000 invested in equipment prepaid at apt minus 2 years and kept the most at the bank while leaving me $ 10-20000 for games at 1-2 and at 2-5 $ from cash to NL to casinos. In general, I always win and I can win decently if I just have a bankroll. Instead, I earn about $ 1,000 a month, which is essential to avoid losing everything. I was only homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and going bankrupt. Sometimes I had over $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 in my sock while I slept outside. Anyone who wants to talk, contact Sevencard2003 on Yahoo Messenger, I recognize that I am different from most homeless people, because I have never smoked or taken drugs. I am no longer homeless, I am now in government housing for $ 177 a month. I receive SSI and spend most of my time winning online poker. Mum and sunflower diversified worked hard to make me SSI. I'm happy that my days spent hiding under the stage in the casino's convention center at night, sleeping, worrying about being caught by security are finally over. If this TV crew had chosen me, it would have been completed much sooner. it's too bad they do not choose who they choose.
