Well, it's been 90 minutes of my life that I will not be coming back. This film gives the teenage television show "California Dreams" the appearance of "almost famous". The acting was awful and the scenario unrealistic. Do not even get me on the band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, look etc. world to accept that one. We see that the guitarist consumes heroin, not that I blame him: if I was around such a putrid group with snowy songs and wooden actors, I would also inject the horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music away seriously, avoid that at all costs.
