Spoilers possible. <br /> <br /> Although there were good actors - especially Chloé Sévigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - it was just not an engaging movie. The passages between the comic part and the tragic part were clumsy or sometimes not very obvious. This viewer was initially puzzled by the fact that the support distribution differs in the two halves; I thought, with the way things were presented in the opening scene, that the people surrounding Melinda would be the same, reacting simply differently (rather a premise "he said, she said"). However, we have two totally different stories and two totally different women, both interpreted by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two dramatic authors of the opening scene - the comedian and the tragedian - are supposed to be following the same principle and go from there, but the two stories are only weakly related. They hardly support the subject of discussion, namely that almost anything can be considered a comedy or a tragedy. Nice distribution, but a disappointing film.
