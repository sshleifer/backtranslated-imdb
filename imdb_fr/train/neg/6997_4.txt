I watched this with a growing sense of discomfort. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these particular people in their attempt to escape Devils Island? And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know that God acts mysteriously, but help thieves, murderers and prostitutes to find redemption, forgiveness and heartbreak in such an abandoned place ... In any case, this movie is not very nice. No matter how charming Gable is in this portrait of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as endearing as it ever was, that is to say, for me, not at all, and all aspect of the film suggests that it was shot 10 years ago. Compared to contemporary films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it looks prehistoric.
