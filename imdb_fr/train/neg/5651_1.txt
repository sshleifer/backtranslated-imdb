In my life, I have seen a lot of great and terrible movies. I am not an expert at professional journals, but I certainly have something to say about this one. First, these actors are the worst I have seen ... Their game is so unreal that you even want to discard the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another frightful thing concerns these dialogues: they are so lame. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14 year old son could act better. I think this film had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you, save your time and money.
