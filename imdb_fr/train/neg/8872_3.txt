Major Payne was not very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor. Major Payne's voice and temperament were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things the boys had to do in this movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
