this film was a major disappointment. the level of cruelty and incessant violence in this movie was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and petty. the main characters were impossible to identify or even to sympathize. the main character was as sticky as they came. the atmosphere of the patients' room and the greenhouses lent themselves to exaggerated theatricality. This film only teaches very little about the Spanish Civil War. Fortunately, I have been to Spain and I realize that it is not realistic! moreover, the use of same-sex attraction as sneaky "horror" was also very shocking and mishandled, while the DVD was packed and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I suppose that if you like to watch children and pets get brutally killed, this movie might particularly please you.
