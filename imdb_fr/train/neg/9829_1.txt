The premise sucked in me, but it was clear that it was only David Lynch or something very serious of about 30 seconds. Interesting to just watch to browse the basicist laundry list. I can be a sucker for a moving spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it. The message seems to be that we must all claim that we have an IQ of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any kind of self-examination otherwise we will trigger the second to come. This is the kind of attitude that leads people to fly large aircraft in buildings of 110 floors (I work close to the site of the former WTC). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
