Without wanting to be a bastard, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the blandest and most cliché films I've ever seen - this one being one of them and the one of Camp Blood being one of them other. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the copy is of poor quality and everything in this film shouts "seriously, you could do better yourself". Maybe it's a challenge for everyone to saturate YouTube with our own zombie-related shit? <br /> <br /> I bought it for £ 1, but remember, you can not put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You should avoid this turkey, even at a good price.
