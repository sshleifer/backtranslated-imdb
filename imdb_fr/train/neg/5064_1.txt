I do not think they made this movie. Completely useless. The first movie was fine. But there was no need for more, especially after a television series that was already following the first film. This film looks like a soap opera. The writing is so bad that it's simple. The jokes do not come, the acting is flat, it pulls like a soap opera, it lacks direction. The first film had a good emotional backbone. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple at the time, but it worked and I could see the merit of this film. But this time, there is no coherent scenario. The characters are bland stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. A good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays the son of Axel Daeseleire is quite well chosen. It was their only moment of creative success on this film. I heard that they had already shot a second television series in the sequel to 'Team Spirit 2', but please do not let them do a third installment ...
