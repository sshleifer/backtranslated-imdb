It must have been one of the most terrible struggles of all time and saved only by 2 games. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, as well as Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a total failure. To be honest, I almost fell asleep. He was so agitated that the coffin match did not deserve the presence of the Undertaker. complete joke. If you're really a huge fan of WWE and you've missed the WWF debut and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I found that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.
