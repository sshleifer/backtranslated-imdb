Okay, I had not heard much about this movie, so when he appeared on the movie channels on TV, I wanted to watch him, being a horror enthusiast. I think I can make a collective "huh?" for all who watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that it was going to happen and some of us had already seen it decided to laugh we both proclaimed, "It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen." It was not scary; I'll give it to Roth (who, in my opinion, is a young pirate); The characters change throughout the movie, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> ALWAYS despite your typical scenario of "rats in a cage" that will light who, etc., it was rather a mean horror. <br /> <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with this kid? I do not even mention him being weird and biting. I'm talking about all karate kicks in slow motion, what was it? 2.) Ok, I know that the character of Rider liked that of Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman, I was dismayed by the fact that he had gone ahead and assaulted her in her sleep . Uh, it's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about writing to you unnecessarily! 4.) What was with the Deputy Minister? 5.) So she was immediately separated by the dog? And there was little or no blood left? Just a piece of his jeans? Anyway, we laughed, and I love to laugh at the Return of the Dead Dead 2, but I do not know if we were supposed to laugh here ...
