The only reason I even gave him a 1 in 10 is because the option to give him zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I knew. For about 75 minutes, you are subjected to the WORST (and I do not say that in the good sense either, as in KILLER NERD, who had a horrible game) and a plot that is not only ridiculous, but absolutely NOTHING to do with a massacre. The reason I even praised this shit is because there is a massacre in the title. That said, there was only one murder in the film and it was pretty nil. You spend more time watching the children bickering and doing the yard work than anything else. Speaking of children, the little actor is probably the most irritating child since Bob from home, near the cemetery. Did I mention that it was also shot in video? If you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life, then look at it well. But if you enjoy your hard earned money and time, stay away as far as possible.
