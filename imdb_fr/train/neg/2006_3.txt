It would be useful to know why it took so long for a book ready to be filmed, such as "The House Next Door", to be adapted to film or television. The book was protected by copyright in 1978. One of the reasons might be 'home' design issues. The house in this Lifetime movie is so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it's so ugly that someone would probably have destroyed it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to suppress when I arrived. through about ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people looking for something occult in life, and this is one of the highlights of the book. These are not people who could conclude that the architect was a kind of demon .. (or the personified devil) without testifying and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, it's mostly a late book, and I do not think it's nice for people running Lifetime. Maybe someone will propose another version of the book in the years to come. A better house..a better music ... a better scenario and a darker lighting ... would certainly help.
