In fact, the use of the BAT swarm documentary used by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective to date. There are shots of teeming bats hung on the ceiling of caves, teeming with bats flying out of the caves or swirling near the mouths of the caves. That's enough to be disturbing: do you imagine all swarming after you? And they are actually spinning into what should have been a 40-minute shutdown sequence, a downright hilarious sequence where a flock of bats seem to be attacking a police car, splashing the windshield like a broken bloody egg . The problem is that this sequence takes about fifty minutes too late to save the movie. It is mostly one or more people running around, screaming, waving their arms to chat eagerly about a poor kid who has been bitten by a bat. while on holiday. <br /> <br /> He is afraid of contracting rabies, which makes him really bad. Their vacation is therefore ruined, as shown in the summary of the plot at the top of the reference page of THE BAT PEOPLE. outside. Here is an effective summary of the film: A young couple leaves for a romantic getaway that is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat. They are bravely trying to hold on, but he starts to delve, trying to convince the people around him that he is a little more involved than rabies, that he can not control himself and that everyone should KEEP FAR. <br /> <br /> Now, when someone swallows their mouths, sweat-stained, eyes amazed as one of the cheapest Muppets, and shouting at you to KEEP AWAY FROM ME, you're moving away from him. You do not try to give him drugs, you do not try to tell him that you love him, you give him his place, go home and try this picturesque getaway next year. <br /> <br /> But no, the characters in this movie all behave like morons, insist on pushing the guy on board, and he turns around, turns into a half-length creature, and kills one lots of nonessential secondary characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the movie forgets that it's a low-budget creature feature and is trying to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we meet a lot of people trying to convince this guy to take a cold pill, and he eventually runs away into the hills, looking much more human than he should have, people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the price. <br /> <br /> The main thing that is wrong in the film is that it should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, and the film should have evoked the type AFTER having it turned into a bat person, rather than on the trip there. It takes about eighty minutes to take off on this front, with some interesting sketches featuring Michael Pataki, always entertaining, as a policeman from a small town who lost his moral advantage, and the late Paul Carr, As a friend doctor, the message is not entirely clear. <br /> <br /> The film is terribly boring, it takes about fifteen minutes too much and misses the opportunity to be a nice little forgettable Creature about a mutant lover as the favorite of the Italian horror RATMAN I watched today and was deeply inspired to try this one after seeing it. My brilliant ideas and I, although the scene with the police car was a howl: Too bad we could not have another twenty minutes of it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
