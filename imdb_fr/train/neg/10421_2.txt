I saw this movie very young (I'm 27 now) and it scared me for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film, from the way it was attracted to music to (obviously) violence. My parents are still arguing over who allowed me to watch it and both of them say they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that, knowing that I have such feelings; 0) I'm currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and because it's a classic) and it's really a beautiful story. However, I do not think it should have been turned into a cartoon. Already. Well, maybe kids nowadays would find this quaint, but it left me with nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in the same way. Give me a little heartbeat each time. Yah, I'm a scoundrel, but I strongly suggest to any parent trying to show this movie to his children, read it rather than watch it first, to make sure he approves of the content. Everyone does not find it as disturbing as me but we are there; 0)
