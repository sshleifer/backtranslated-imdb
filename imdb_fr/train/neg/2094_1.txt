I had to endure almost all the series of the show, anxieties in high school and family conflicts. I really do not care about high school girls who are worried about their relationships. I have spent my time in hell dealing with such problems and I do not care about fictitious teenagers going through "lite" versions of the horrors I've endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the series. We FINALLY see a proto-Cylon. It was good but with a problem. His red eye would be locked on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyelids are still on the plane, giving the machine a map of the world. The red dot never stops moving. <br /> <br /> I really hope the writers will solve this abuse before the second episode.
