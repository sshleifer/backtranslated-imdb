Hm. Although it's a nice movie to dig holes in the plot, point out atrocious and primitive special effects (at best) (which have all led me to watch this film three times in the last six years), Severed is ranks among the worst I have ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are. All I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen on the scene of the murder on the dancefloor. Overall, I do not really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are nice, the rest is a mixture of confused dialogues and images that fail to advance the story to a conclusion logical (which I do not remember anyway). ).
