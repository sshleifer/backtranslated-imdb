I can always tell when something is going to be a success. I see him or hear him and I feel good. I did not have a good impression looking at the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film and I am not at all surprised that it is ranked among the 100 worst films. I was actually right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that destabilized me was the title. Not that I have an ebony problem (I'm black by the way), but for a movie, they could have used a better title and use a title devoid of bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of the dance film is being exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better than that in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not make me vibrate.
