I do not know if this is one of SyFy Channel's original films, but that's exactly how it feels. A cheap and low-budget action movie that was probably made very quickly. It contains ludicrous effects, a lame dialogue and a faintly faded star to give it some fame (funny to see how many children of 90210 shoot cheap TV movies). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, which history has taught us as an explorer, who has eliminated entire populations of Aboriginal peoples while conquering parts of North America. Here, he is not played as a hero nor even in sympathy, but as a glutinous opportunist; his character would probably be killed if it was not vaguely based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a short surveying mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves funding to further explore America. He and his men discover a small tribe of Aztec infested with dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The hero of this story turns out to be Lieutenant Rios, who is honorable, resourceful and wise. He knows what to do in each situation, which puts him in opposition with Cortes, as well as with the young and ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the stubborn and intriguing shaman cracks for Rios, reinforcing her anger towards the Spanish foreigners. So, everything is beautiful shot. Dinosaurs are shipped with relative ease. Although taking place in an area that seems wide open, the story unfolds pretty much in the woods or in the Aztec village 95% of the time, so it's not visually exciting. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and, somehow, he disappeared. However, it does not seem or does not sound Spanish for a second, making the cast selection wrong in every way. If this film had been released in theaters, it would have been chosen for a Razzie, no question. <br /> <br /> Overall, we can forget about it.
