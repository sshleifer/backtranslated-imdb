The first ten minutes of this film on the set of an international film in Belgium are acceptable: you see a real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of the nervous breakdown, the cool movie was directed by Mickey Rourke star, etc. . You have already seen everything, but it is well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time, the film is repeated: the same ten minutes again and again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has a good two minutes when his character talks about his crazy career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. In all, it's been a good 12 minutes. <br /> <br />
