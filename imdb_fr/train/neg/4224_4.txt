STAR STARTING: ***** The Works **** just misses the mark *** That little something between ** Late * The pits <br /> <br /> In this first effort for the man well -loved by Nick Park and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace lacks cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the shortest of 22 minutes, this adventure W / G is also the oldest and it shows a little. The modeling clay animation is a bit squeaky and fun here, reminiscent of Mork's animation of the little man in the box. Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and it was more from when I was younger and less aware of, say, the Smaller Pleasures of Life.) I was motivated to actively pursue this early effort because of the renewed popularity resulting from the recent and extremely successful film adaptation. <br /> <br /> As technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) it lacks the emotional angle it should have. That being said, it's pretty fun to be a first try and set the standard for better things to come. Two stars, but two good stars. **
