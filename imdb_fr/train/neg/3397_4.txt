The trailer of this movie interested me enough to justify the rental of the DVD. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrible! Admittedly, it's not the worst movie of all time, nor the worst film of this year, but it's close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the film ignores what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting because it deals with the traps of mail order brides, but the film is a mess. What begins at first as a slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then totally reverses and degenerates into a very dark and unpleasant misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know, and Ben Chaplin is lost! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, who, I suppose, did that for their money. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the drama is just plain bad. A movie to avoid, unless you absolutely must see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their movies!
