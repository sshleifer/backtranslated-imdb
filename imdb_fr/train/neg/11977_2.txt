Roy Rogers and his company are trying to revive "Sintown" - it's a ghost town that could explode if silver mining succeeds. Andy Devine (under the name "Cookie") slips on it. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitch to the ladle of Mr. Rogers. Foy Willing and the Sage Purple Horsemen replace (or is it singular?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the sons of the pioneers. James Finlayson (from Laurel and Hardy movies) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor board offers winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule is unleashed. There is also energetic human performance, but the material is not big. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
