really horrible ... the main actor played well ... the movie, the plot, etc. was completely nil and inaccurate, it could just as well have been a continuation of good ... everything that mattered little or nothing to Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided as the plague by all the followers of Carlito ... no mention Gail's actually, he ends up with another bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he was caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail. .. they tried to do it as the original with flash backs at first ... but to be honest, I was looking for a zero point ... unfortunately, I had to note it above ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to win what was one of the best movies of the 90s. Overall, it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life lost. .. for all the action, it was really boring, slow and predictable ... again, for all fans of Carltio's Way, avoid this fiasco ...
