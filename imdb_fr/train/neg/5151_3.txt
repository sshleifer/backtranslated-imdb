I thought it was a good idea but, boy, was it badly done? We have a general idea of ​​the complexities and challenges behind a program's behind-the-scenes operations, but virtually no details are given. Producers do not seem to have found a way to tell a story or to give the viewer a "crossing". (This does not mean that they have not tried, but that the machinists are staging a summary of the ringing cycle, because the narrative of the program tells us nothing about the physical editing work of an opera.) <br /> <br /> We see a lot of things happening, but we are told little about what people do and why. It is difficult to know who is who and how the different production departments fit together and work together. For example, many times we hear of some problem - we expect to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is solved. But instead, filmmakers usually just move on (usually pretty generic sequences of people pushing things or talking in headphones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie ends up feeling more like running under the end credits of a show, rather than watching what deserves to be watched.
