I'm surprised the many voters who give even better ratings to this film. My idea about this movie was that the target audience was an adult and a man. Whipped and tortured women, ruthless revenge and high death toll, are typical ingredients introduced into the film's history by the spaghetti subgenus. Opening and smashing are DJANGO scams. THE SHOOTER does not have the style, for example, DJANGO. Score, performance and cinematography are mediocre at best, but if you are looking for the ingredients mentioned above, you are in the right place here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
