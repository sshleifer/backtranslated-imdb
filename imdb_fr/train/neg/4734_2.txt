Do you like beautiful girls? Yeah me too. What is wrong with the beautiful girls / women? Nothing good, so why should I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, when it had the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something like that. This is a movie, a so-called action movie nonetheless. So, by definition, he does not really need a conspiracy, does he? I do not agree 100%, but say yes to that. So what does he need? Sequences of 20 minutes of part 1 (I exaggerate maybe a little, but it was more than 20 minutes ...) ?! It would be "no". But again, you never know, the people who watched the first part might not know what they ate this morning at breakfast, so good, let's remind them ... hey maybe even remind them twice ? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits arrive, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> Then forget the story, the development of the character, the real emotions, the "game" (and no, I do not think that women in skirts walking and / or fighting are responsible for act!) ... what does this leave? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch, trust me ...
