This film offers absolutely no imagination, neither in principle nor in its execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy at all. properly speaking. The story speaks of a tricky point about analytical risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheating on him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria) after just one honeymoon day. Back home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and meet Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) with whom they went to school years earlier. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives without worries, unlike Reuben, but they start dating together and Reuben starts to change as a person then that he's starting to try new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods. But one day, Lisa returns and wants to stay married to Reuben but he really does not want but Polly decides to leave because she does not believe in marriage. <br /> <br /> This film is the second directing effort of John Hamburg who wrote two unlikely scenarios in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films appear to be classics compared to this obsolete piece of drivel. It's very easy to say that something is not funny, but I think with this movie it's even easier to understand why. This movie is totally and completely predictable from beginning to end, with each scene seeming to happen only because of the ridiculous scenario. Hamburg, who also wrote the screenplay, seems to have written it without thinking of trying something different. He sometimes seems to try to generate the same energy as "There is something of Mary", but the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think that the blind ferret was funny? If you do, your easy! Some times during the film, the characters would inexplicably use these emotional speeches supposed to summarize everything, but all they would get would be to overestimate the obvious. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he should work less and wait for the best scripts to come to him, because this film does not work like a comedy or a romance.
