I saw this movie in a theater in Chicago and I should have appreciated it, because I love Nemesis ?? but if the first half-hour is skilfully performed, the rest is just sub-predatory video fodder, a long chase through these empty post-modern empties of Pyun. My girlfriend fell asleep. I still like Pyun, but not that
