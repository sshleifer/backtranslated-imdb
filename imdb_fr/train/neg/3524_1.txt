This is one of the worst cases of movie drivel I've seen in a long time. It's so horrible that I do not know where to start or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' because he achieves a decent performance on his part. But this plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I particularly appreciate the fact that it comes from the top of a mountain at the top, while the helicopter is on its way. A climb of a day or two takes him every five minutes! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Apart from the sad opening (that even a five-year-old would be able to predict the outcome of it), the rest is ridiculous. Sorry, but it's about as bad as making a movie.
