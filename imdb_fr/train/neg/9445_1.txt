Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was dismayed. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take the kids to see this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - besides, they will be bored and disappointed. Certainly, * we * have all read Theo's wonderful children's book and we certainly have expectations ... but it's pure junk. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never have given up on such a despicable attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you have one, buy the book and give it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is not worth a "free" ticket tour. <br /> <br /> Stick to the book The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual representation - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on the cable on St. Patrick's Day. <br /> <br /> Shame shame shame on what they do!
