Ah, the movie sex-and-gore. It's a shame they do not manufacture them anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if everything goes like that, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The film is basically two adorable vampires who pick up "customers" along a country road and take them home to their castle, have crazy sex with them, then eat them (except the first victim they keep with them for no particular reason). Things get complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women that she keeps seeing. It's getting really ugly from here. In the end, the two vampires are so thirsty that they eat everything in sight and manage to let their captive victim escape. Oops, too bad for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that both vampires do not mind to undress and laugh with each other is the only feature of this film. Otherwise, it is a bloody and confusing disorder (why is their tomb so far from their castle?), Which can only be observed during the few minutes of vampire play. The only thing I get from this movie is these two valuable tips: shooting lesbians will not kill them; that will only turn them into vampires, and do not take prostitutes along a country road; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it was not worth it.
