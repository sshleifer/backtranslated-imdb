I found Horrorvision almost impossible to watch. While only 70 minutes long, I still found myself pressing the button again and again. The acting game was of the type "if I scream and say that I am very intense". And the story was at best a scenario that had not been clarified yet. <br /> <br /> Although I never go to Full Moon for the production of high quality movies, I have never seen them produce such a bad thing.
