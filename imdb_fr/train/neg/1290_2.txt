This film lasted two and a quarter hours. Someone please tell me what the point was? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It would be a motley group of Confederate Bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the border between Missouri and Kansas, who would take revenge on all sympathizers and abolitionists of the North during the American Civil War. But aside from gratuitous violence, this film did not really have a purpose. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is really nothing more than gratuitous violence? If that were the case, it would have been done very well, but I do not think that was the case. I think the producers really thought to make a movie worthy of interest here, but as far as I'm concerned, there was no plot. It seemed like I was watching a pocket novel come to life, with characters that looked like what you would see on the cover of such novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be burned with some of the cities of this gang burned!
