"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's. What could he think about when making "Toys"? When he watched the rushes, did he see a successful and fun fantasy? If that's the case, he's working on a plane other than mine. It is an unsustainable image, in which the conception of production represents 90% of the thing (and even the colors of the cartoon are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (more particularly) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as heirs to the plant when their father dies. There is nothing really funny (satirical or awesome) on display here. It is uniformly slippery, ugly and one of the worst "big" movies of all time. NO STARS of ****
