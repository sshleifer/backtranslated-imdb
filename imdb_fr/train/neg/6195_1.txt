Poorly done. A dreadful acting game and an end that the director seemed to be trying to invent from nowhere, the film was frankly nothing dull. It is shocking that this film is considered an award at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater was of the same opinion as me: what's the point of making the film? The references to Iraq were either weird or just badly thought. I'm surprised this movie was released - very disappointing and a waste of time. Sorry, a terribly negative review, but I hope it will deter some people from making the same mistake. What a shame we did not have questions and answers at the end of the film - it might have been interesting now.
