This is the perfect example of what not to do when you have a good idea. That's the problem is not it? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution lack real substance. It should grab you from the beginning, then pull a little on your emotions, interest you and invest in the characters. This film does not have what it takes to take off and continue its flight, and here's why. First, you do not really care about characters because they are not presented in a way that people can understand. I mean it's neither Superman nor Mission Impossible here, but normal people in a stressful situation. They are not credible in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a chewing gum is a chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time, this is not the way to go. I mean, what is it? Looks like he's in the bathroom or something. I loved him in the role of resuscitator and his way of playing the medical genius intense / neurotic and misunderstood him. But not for that, he tries too hard to compensate by looking so intensely and nervously, but in a neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised he did not dislocate his jaw during the shoot. The film is essentially based on the maintenance of life, it has hardly an impulse and it made me wait for something that would never come.
