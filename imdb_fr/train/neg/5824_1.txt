I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some correct songs, but there is this song in the end who is just a guy who shouts "Yaowwww!" while someone randomly taps on a wooden object. That being said, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth it to see his movie finished. Go to iTunes (they have the album), preview it and choose the right ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, it's a slight exaggeration. But you will see what I mean if you see it. That being said: DO NOT SEE IT!
