Bad performance of Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Very underdeveloped support characters. Talky boring without any real plot. The end leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more ends than you could link in four suites (that is, if you care about those wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. The penultimate sequence in which "the hood of Chicago" seeks the character of Sinatra is laughable. The music in this sequence is also poor. And in the final scene, when Martin's character takes off his hat from the woman he called "pig," he almost pulled me out and found a stone to throw through my TV screen.
