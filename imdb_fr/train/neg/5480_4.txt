It was 1 am and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in the past during the Spanish colonies. A group went to an island. They are not long in meeting a big "reptile" who devours their horse. Soon, they are captured by the natives and to gain freedom, they must kill the "gods of reptiles". The cg sucks; it reminds me of the CG of the first console video games. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about it is the native hottie running around in a skinny outfit. Otherwise, it's just a mediocre effort.
