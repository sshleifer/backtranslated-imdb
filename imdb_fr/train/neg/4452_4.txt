Let's say that I had to suspend my incredulity more for Spiderman than for the Hooligans. That is to say, I have less difficulty believing that Toby McGuire can stick to the buildings that Elijah Wood give up with tough guys in Manchester. I will not go into details, because I do not want to write spoiler, but the idea that British men, professional and cultured, mingle every day from death to death, is, well, funny. And this movie is not. The fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, are taken too seriously. The gravity of the pugilate, the reverence with which the subject is treated, becomes irritating because it neither establishes nor resolves the conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guinness truck, has been slapped with an artificial "fish out of the water" theme so that the viewer can look into Woods' watery eyes as he learns to become a man. . Hit other young men opposite football with blunt objects, then run away as fast as he can. The characters are caricatures, especially Americans at Harvard. The development of the character and the story are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film will not reach its peak before the end. You will have spent almost two hours of your life never to return. Pick up "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this nerdy and disappointing idiot. He does not waste time with the empty melodrama, the old "Yankee in King Aurthur's Court", tired, or weepy, parables of bullshit maturity. They are just pure, dark and fun. the way violence is supposed to be.
