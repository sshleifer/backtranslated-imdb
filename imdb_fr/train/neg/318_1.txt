I stole this film while I was a student at the university. I tried to watch him three times, the other two because friends wanted to see him. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I have never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny, it must be funny." False! I can not make myself look at this pile of shit after the boxing fight / insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes physical pain in your opponent. You might think that this terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after looking at it, you'll know it's the truth. This film is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a ton of Steven Segal movies, and I even watched Crossroads twice ... but I still could not watch that.
