I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One of the weakest attempts of Hollywood to propose a new idea. It's a good thing that I keep a bowl of lemons in the refrigerator. In case. They should give Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". People who are completely and totally marketed (and most of them) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would rather see a completely stupid movie that does not try to hide it. In my opinion, it was an incredibly stupid movie and it made an even more unbelievably sad attempt to try to hide that fact. <br /> <br /> All sheep seem to like him.
