This film is probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life - going beyond the previous horrendous movie, "Spawn of Slithis", which I saw at the age of 10. <br /> <br /> Bad play, ridiculous and ridiculous dialogues, incomprehensible plot, cut melodic scenes, even the music was boring. Have I forgotten something? The special effects are not bad, but CGI is not a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I actually spent money to watch this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the manager), please forward them to my username "on gmail" and I will contact him to personally request a refund.
