I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even shot! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am by no means hateful for Uwe Boll like most people without humor on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll movies such as Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was horrible. I hated it so much that I would give it a scratch if I could. The story is just shit! He spends four fifths of the movie building the plot, and then the center is made up of horrific and terrifyingly grizzly murder scenes! The end finally with a "villan wins the end" which is quite acceptable but it surely would have been more taste than that! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) or against violent films! I love violent movies! Loved Saw, Hostel, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, The 28 Movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, The Last House On the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, All Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah and Cannibal Movies f ** King Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverse! And watch the movies I just listed! If I loved the Cannibal Holocaust and not that, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not go back into the darkness! You're funny when you're light, just like Ed Wood. It was just a horrible experience! I felt horrible after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH !!!! Avoid at all costs !!!!!
