watching this movie I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and each time was a real pleasure. When my wife arrived in Sweden, she looked at the old men and had a good laugh. but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again. it's terrible from start to finish. how can they manage to make it so bad. well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi. may this film has never been reviewed and never sent on a show. burn the film and save the children. if you want to watch Pippi, watch the original movie and have fun. WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, you will never be opposed to being Pippi ... Oh yes ... reading the explanation of the "spoilers", "spoil" a surprise and deprive the spectator of the suspense and the enjoyment of the movie. "Well, I guess the director defends this idea ... you watch this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
