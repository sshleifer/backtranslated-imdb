It seems that everyone in this movie is channeling Woody Allen. They stammer and stop and stammers again. Only for REALLY hard-core DeNero fans! He tries to appear artistic and artistic - but he presents himself as a film with very very small budget, made by students. The word most often used throughout the movie is "hum". The film tells the atmosphere of the late sixties and early seventies. If you like movies where people constantly talk about each other, horrible lighting (even if it's for "art") and give you the impression of sitting in a lame political meeting , so you might like it - but you need to be really bored. I found this CD in the dollar tray and now I know why.
