it's a piece of s - t !! that sounds worse than a fact for TV movie. and I get to think that a sequel was even imagined and that the result ... the war is prettier than this one. jean claude van shame did it again and he wonders why his career is at this stage. no script, no story and no time to lose. I want to say that. 1 in 10 is too high, much too high. Goldberg should be hammered for this. van honte is not an actor.
