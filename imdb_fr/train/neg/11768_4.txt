This reboot looks like a McDonald's processed meal compared to the very good but very underestimated movie "The Incredible Hulk" of 2003. <br/> "The Hulk" by Ang Lee is a cartoon movie for the Thinker. Hulk takes a little time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he sees it, we see the conflict in the heart of our protagonist. He does his best not to lose control of his heart, but as he admits, when he lets go of his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now, let's compare it to Edward Norton's turn, where no conflict is apparent. in his personality, he turns into a Hulk every time he gets excited and his pulse reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this commentator, it looked like the introduction of "mid-chlorians" in "The Phantom Threat", which indicates the strength of "strength" with one of them, as if mystic abilities could be measured at the same time. help with a blood test. In the 2008 film, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is keep his pulse to less than 200, as a device attached to his wrist allows. And for the record, it's extremely difficult to get a pulse rate of up to 200, even after an exciting race, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions are at the root of Eric Bana's Hulk. He suppressed memories of his mother's death and the role of his father in his youth. On the surface, he is calm, but there is a strong anger below, a rage sufficient to feed Hulk when he is unleashed. But Hulk never intentionally kills, not even his attackers. Most of the time, he just wants to escape or get close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It hurts its fencers and, in a critical scene, saves a fighter jet that pursues it after a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, the visual effects are there, but according to the needs. The action scenes (and they are many) are necessary to the plot, unlike the movie of 2008 where the action is inserted for reasons of action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn him into a "fugitive" story, Ed Norton no longer focuses on what Bruce Banner thinks about the Hulk. For him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of a bad experience. And Louis Leterrier, the director who interprets the signal of Ed Norton, adds no emotional dimension to the relationship between Banner and Hulk. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is pursued and Hulk hits the buttocks, Banner is pursued and Hulk gives the buttocks. Repeat if necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that opposed the movie of 2003 is that it may not be as faithful to comics as the 2008 version. However, even though I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a film that is not as faithful to comics as the dream of a fanboy, but who has the heart on the 2008 version of the comic book, faithful to reality but manufactured and without soul. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is the perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and heartfelt.
