I read articles here about the Wonder Woman Costume for this TV movie. It should be noted at the time the film was shot, she was not wearing her traditional outfit. The producers were actually sticking to WW's design for the comic book writer in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, I agree with many other posters here . Snoozefest! I was a child when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at my age to have enjoyed a movie about a cartoon hero. Yet, I was so "engrossed" by the plot that I stopped watching it three-quarters in the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
