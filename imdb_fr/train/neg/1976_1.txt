How is it possible that such a bad movie can be made. Bad game Bad script. Just an embarrassment all around. It's just a bad shot after another. <br /> <br /> This movie contains big stars. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This film brings in almost nothing for a good reason. The attraction of black cowboy movies is simply not there. It's too bad they did not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie contains big stars.
