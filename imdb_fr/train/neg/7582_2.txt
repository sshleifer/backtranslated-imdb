High heels are delicate things. They can raise women (or men in transvestites) to new heights, highlight an assertive style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and an ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more a disappointing trip than an elegant high-rise. <br /> <br /> The mother-daughter drama of Almodóvar is elegant, but in terms of scenario, it is a tedious and tedious affair, full of confusion and complexity of characters who never engage fully or that do not make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones Lejanos is just not interesting. The best part comes at first in a wonderfully macabre manslaughter case orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant piece of black comedy, things look good, but the film ends up falling. <br /> <br /> There are quite strong acting performances and an artistic and elegant direction that one would expect from Almodóvar, but Else, Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, a broken mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternatively judge, transvestite and police informer, it could have been a melodramatic center. Instead, it's poor. High Heels stumbles for sure.
