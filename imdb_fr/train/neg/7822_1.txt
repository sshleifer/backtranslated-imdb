This movie is a very bad attempt to make money using a classic theme. I loved Superman's movies, but this one made me want to film myself. Very bad acting, scandalous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To sum up: Superman leaves the Earth because scientists have discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh), said nothing to his girlfriend before leaving (still duh), takes off in a spaceship (?!?), Comes Back, I think 5 years later, and I can not wait to find his girlfriend (who is shaving his son, who son, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old ). And what about this Lex Luthor? Trying to cultivate a new continent to sell land? <br /> <br /> I vote 1 vote out of 10 for this film, only because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have something to do with your time, do not go see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch TV!
