This movie is so bad that I can not believe it was shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Have we really watched the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) Going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), the musical score (what is it that the ****?), The editing and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. It reminds me of the old film macistes ... To give you an example of the amateurism of production, the suit of the siren is a sleeping bag with glitter stuck on it. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes we find here: you see in an extra scene, a fat woman of about 100 pounds who talks about her mobile phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different place, you can see this same woman who is still talking on her mobile phone (!). Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A huge waste of money. Needless.
