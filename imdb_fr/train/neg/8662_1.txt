What a horrible movie. I love monster movies, but I could not even look at half the terrible actors, cardboard characters and horrible special effects. There is nothing that redeems about this movie. The characters come either from an infinite stock of suicidally stupid canine fodder, or empty and uninteresting puppets. The plot is a formula, cut and paste, drivel science-run-amok standard. Even the CGI is horrible. You know it's bad when you can not even rely on the film to give you a candy for the eyes. No surprises here, just the same old one. It's really one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should hang from a light pole so the kids can use it as a pinata.
