It's really a strange start for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic father whose life collapses all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks for a preacher's name, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. It improves everything. Ahh ... if only everything was so easy in life. The fact that this "film" seems to have been made with about 500 dollars will certainly not help. 1/10
