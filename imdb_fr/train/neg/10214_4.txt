Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, are coming back for this minor offering of Universal Horror. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as comedic comedian "Babe", Fuzzy Knight replaces him with an idiotic buddy named "Stuff". But the results are far from being so charming and the level of fear is practically nil. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who has the idea of ​​conducting a treasure hunt on an isolated island in a scary old castle. Peggy is part of the band that accompanies the group. But there's a tall, lean lookalike John Carradine in a black cape and hat called "The Phantom" that crushes the party in search of the buried fortune itself. <br /> <br /> This "ghost" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try to keep his rather middle face in the shadows to create tension or fantasy. It's always nice to see Perry Moran, but otherwise, you can write this as one of Universal's instantly forgettable failures.
