It's the only movie I've ever seen that made me write a review on a website, and it's an important statement from someone who likes "The Monolithic Monster Attack". This film is perfect for those who want a harmless movie. He is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I think this movie is safe for kids of all ages. This film is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily catch up in front of the television while children watch this movie. Do not be surprised, though, if you wake up to find out that the kids turned off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who loves to be entertained, who loves everything, from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, theater, comedy and action, all these things for adults that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination offers.
