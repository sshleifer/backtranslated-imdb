2 out of 10 possible - and it's too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how I miss it. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard had this weekend. He took that piece of dribble out. I suspected for a long time Sam S. to be a little crazy, this film, based on his play, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artistic film. that actors love to bite their teeth because it gives them a chance to be emotional forever. However, for the viewer who sits down through this absurd junk, there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. <br /> <br /> You did not see dysfunctional families until you saw this group. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the girl is, oh yes, crazy. They also have a mouth on them that utters words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage girl. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot - and this is the case Although you can read it carefully, it has a hole the size of the Alaska. <br /> <br /> My conspire to sell their dilapidated farm. It turns out that Pa is the same. Now, I do not pretend to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, a property owned by a joint property must have both the owner's signatures for can be sold. If only one of them owned the property, the other could not sell it legally, so it would be useless to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this fundamental fact and, as a result, his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> That said, nothing else really worked. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason why anyone could have to watch this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone would want to.
