After a day of work, I sat down to relax and turn on the movie channels. The film appeared on the guide and seemed interesting so I listened to it just before starting. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but Jamie Foxx's lack of acting talent and the slow movement of the plot made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If you have the merit to act in this film, it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the film interesting. Overall, do not expect to impress your friends by choosing this one as a tenant for a movie night.
