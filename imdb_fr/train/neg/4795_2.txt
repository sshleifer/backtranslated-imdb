It seems to be the only film John Saxon ever made and had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from beginning to end, and it is dull and wooden, there is not much to do. A Vietnamese war hero works for a mafia boss, becomes a little too friendly with his wife, and then it is killed by the mafia boss himself and the imprisoned war hero sent to prison in the hallway of death, in particular. Now, this particular prison is experimenting with detainees and testing a formula that will turn men into an ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are all those infected people trapped in the prison, some of whom turn into zombies and the others who just do not want to be there anymore. It goes on and on, with nothing to show or say, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to happen a few times, but no, he was apparently ready to take off for good. different way and just as dull. If you watch until the end, they may become a zombie themselves, so do not go there. 2 out of 10
