Can you say "Any shock, no conspiracy?" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no story about the room other than the dead. * WHY * was it bad? What made it so? Why a countdown "hour"? Then there were unexplored things to be heard; for example, we saw a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. But when he climbed, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How about all the ghosts looking "digital" and things "disappearing" before hitting the floor with a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, 1408 looks like a high-tech house. Except that there was no follow up to that. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... the electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for TV ... the cell phone does not signal, but wireless internet works well. How many incontinence can you possibly add? I'm sorry, but this movie was only "shock after shock". Everything has been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things have just come out of the site. Changing paintings. Bleeding of the walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no, it was not." And if the play was "perverse," why compel our main character to accept the death of his daughter, if that would keep him prisoner anyway? It made no sense. <br /> <br /> Moreover, he had no basic information on "The first book". Just some vague information about "Dad was a fool" and so on. Speaking of dads, what was there about his father? "You will be in my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a really horrible movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, with no new or innovative effects, and certainly no story, character development, etc. Using just one set and a few shots, it was nothing, but a recycled, old-fashioned, "seen-what-before" effect film.
