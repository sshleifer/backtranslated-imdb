We went to the movie with a group because the room we were going to was canceled. It's probably one of the worst movies of all time. It's not that I do not like the cult movies I do. But nothing happens in the movie. We do not feel any connection with the characters. endless time without dialogue. And the car. How can they carry a huge tent and chairs and clothes for each day in this car? It's a two-seater! I must say however that the scenery is beautiful, but not in a film, the director should have made a photo shoot of the film, so we can spend about 80 minutes of unnecessary time without anything happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it because it's a waste of time
