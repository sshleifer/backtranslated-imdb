I'm a fan of Without A Trace of the first episode. I really can not express my disappointment with last week's episode. This is a REAL problem that far too many African American families have treated and continue to treat. The lack of crucial media coverage in the first 48 hours has been documented in a recent study. Law enforcement agencies, including local, state and federal authorities, are also accomplices. What was the purpose of advertising this subject and abandoning the end? Apparently, TV can treat almost ANY subject, EXCEPT RACE. It's shameful.Get it together or do not explore it next time.
