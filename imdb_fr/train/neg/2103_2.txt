Bela Lugosi is a devilish botanist who sends poisoned orchid wives on their wedding day, steals the body in her fake ambulance / hearse and takes her home to extract the glandular juice in order to keep Bela's wife in perpetuity. Some second-rate players playing detectives are trying to solve this terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi is doing well, but you can say that he needed that money. <br /> <br /> This film is really awful, and most of the actors would have preferred to stay on waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell no one what's going on and they tend to laugh a lot and demand to see the movie. I bought the DVD in a discounted shop 2 for Â£ 1, which, in my opinion, is a fairly accurate estimate. Whoever would pay more for it would be crazy.
