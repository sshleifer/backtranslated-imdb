There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary" that I found myself screaming on TV. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a dazzling looking DVD, but he is sorely lacking in looking at the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> It is based on the inaccuracy, on not telling the whole story, on the old "favorite government is always lying to us", innuendo and people who believe what is told to them and not checking the accuracy or details of the statements. <br /> <br /> Moreover, its "exclusive" or "unpublished" sequences are freely available on the Internet from different sites. <br /> <br /> having read about the circumstances surrounding the shooting of this production shows that he used false pretenses to get interviews and that he used a creative treatment of the answers in order to assert his own opinions . <br /> <br /> All the statements made by Mr Sibrel about the "inaccuracies", "errors" or "denunciations" in the Apollo program have been deepened. I am disapproved. <br /> <br /> How can I recover these 40 minutes of my life?
