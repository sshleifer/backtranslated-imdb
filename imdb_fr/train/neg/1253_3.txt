I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on redesigning bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake is not a total waste, I would still like to have the six dollars back to go to a DVD of the original. A lot of violence and one of the worst things I know. This version adds nothing new. It only repeats why Hollywood should leave the good things aside.
