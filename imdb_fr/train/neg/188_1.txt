This film has beautiful landscapes. Unfortunately, there is no conspiracy. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This film did not have one. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never managed to put any activity into it. The image is artistic, but lacks attention to the fundamentals of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana landscapes and fly fishing, you will find value in this film but do not wait for a story. There are not any.
