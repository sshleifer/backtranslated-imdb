This show seemed to be pretty good. Kyra Sedgwick is a trustworthy actress and I like crime drama, but somewhere in production, this program went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the editors should have more suspects than you, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! This makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and impossible to believe. I know they wanted her to be tough, but she's mean, stupid and a bad leader. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way. As stated above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a big disappointment and a very bad result ...
