I do not like to look like an "old person", but frankly, I have not seen many movies that I loved and that were shot after 1960 ... in general, the movies seem Worse and worse (although I liked Scott Baio's movie vehicle "The Bread, My Sweet", with the exception of the sexual scene "of rigor" which adds NOTHING value to this movie ). This film shows that the mother, a former girl from the Las Vegas choir, seems to be unable to survive alone, although she is clearly in her 50s (although she suggested that it was in her forties). I did not buy it. I am 57 years old and, like all the women I have known in my 50s and 40s, I am more than capable of surviving alone (as I have done since finishing high school at age 13, I I am legitimately emancipated and I started life.) <br /> <br /> The girl is not credible in her role ... she gets a promotion she does not deserve (a great opportunity) and drops that ball too, but when another employee comes in ready to be delivered, the writers criticize her as an "opportunist", as she does what a career-oriented person would do - by taking advantage of a a largely open opportunity created by the lack of discipline of his colleague, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of keeping his promises (to his supervisor, in this case). <br /> <br /> The girl reluctantly lets her mother stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother (the woman who gave her life and raised her to adulthood ") as an outcast. Apparently, "writers" of guts like these do not understand that it is NOT "a common thing" that PARENTS act as children and are then treated as children by THEIR children. It's a bit more of the "fake" society that Hollywood continues to try to impose on us, as if we, their audience, were stupid to want to be entertained by their creative offerings. <br /> <br /> It's sad. movie with a stupid end. If the young restorer had been real and not a two-dimensional TV character, he would have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not much older than him and very attractive. But in the end, he "falls in love" with the girl, a shallow and rather uninteresting girl who has that kindness of youth, but in an ordinary and bland manner. (The "opportunistic" young woman who worked with this girl nothing was much more physically attractive.) <br /> <br /> There was no credible reason presented to the public as to why the restaurateur preferred the girl (who selfish, egotistical and selfish woman, who treated her mother with incredible disrespect) to the mother - a kind-hearted, gentle, humorous and joyful woman that the girl could not even begin to understand. Of course, the mother had her own faults ... she had reacted to the death of her husband by being stupefied for a year or two after, which would have created the break between her and her shy daughter. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how the characters were developed or not, this is a whimsical movie and a loss of watch time, unless you really love it. (Where is the mustard?)
