If you have ever seen a slasher of the eighties, there is not much reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the highlights of Slasher Cinema, and this is something that is seriously missing from this movie. There is really not much to say about Pranks, so I'll do it fast. The film was one of the 74 films on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that's the only reason I saw it. The plot follows a group of children staying in a dorm at Christmas time. As they are in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them up, which leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this film is on the list of Video Nasty is weird because, despite some bloody scenes, this movie will hardly corrupt or deprave anyone, and slashers more gorier than this one (Friday 13, for example) did not find themselves banished. But again, there are forbidden movies that are much less bloody than this one (The Witch who came from the sea, for example). Be that as it may, the conclusion of the film is the best thing about it, because even though the public really did not care who the attacker was at this point; it's pretty well done. All in all, it's a dismal and gloomy slasher that even slasher fans would do well to miss.
