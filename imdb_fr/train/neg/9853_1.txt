I think that almost everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit it to the maximum. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are at the forefront of technology, but from a scientific point of view, it just does not work. Flying bladders filled with hydrogen? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to make it look like a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. Overall, the film is entertaining, but I always found myself saying "oh my brother, what a load of ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, look instead at This Is Spinal Tap. Or at least turn off the sound.
