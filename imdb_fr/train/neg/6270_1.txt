One way or another, a woman who works with a scientist puts round metal balls in people's mouths, which supposedly changes their personality but turns them into reality like mad killers, like zombies . The "guinea pigs" of the experiment are young nubile women, scarcely dressed, who desperately need drama lessons. This film is horrible, atrocious and incredibly bad. There is little or no logic in the script. You will really have trouble following what is happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen supposed to represent a huge scientific progress looks nothing like an old Atari screen. And what's even worse is that there's also a puppet with felt-tip hairs (which looks like a solitary summer camp kid) named George who's like a personal servant / confidant of Jessica (the "main" actress). Throughout the film, you will be subjected to idiots and sophomics of this puppet. But wait ... you also get a lot of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. Meanwhile, a most boring soundtrack plays in the background as if some kind of spiritual discovery had taken place. None of the actors are good. There are just different degrees of bad. The gore and horror aspects are particularly filmed. The movie really looks like a teenager. No coincidence, Henry Sala, the director by name, but no job, did not shoot another film. I was almost bored in a coma watching this stupid, silly, fucking! And how does it end? What happened? If you know it, let me enter the secret because for my life I can not understand it. All I know is that I lost the time spent looking at this waste that made the beginning of my weekend a nightmare!
