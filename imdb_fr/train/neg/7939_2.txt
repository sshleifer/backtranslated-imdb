Among the dilapidated ranks of the already saturated subgenus of Hillybilly Horror, we find this lamentable tale of a family on vacation terrorized by rednecks. Sounds familiar? Well, it is most certainly suitable for anyone with a basic knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems to be content to recycle all the old clich√©s used (deformed bastards, a peaceful family transformed into assailant killers when we see it, the rebellious girl, the "monster" who has a good heart, etc.), but that is not enough it is not enough for it to be a total waste of time. It's a forgettable thing, but with humor, J.D. Hart has already played in the film "Films that Suck" earlier in his career, a rather ironic omen. <br /> <br /> My note: D-
