Drama "hilariously obvious" on a band of students (I think) who love non-stop hip-hop, break dance, graffiti and try to become Roxy dj - or something. To be quite honest, I got so bored that I forgot! Even lovers of music agree that this film is terribly played and - as a drama - failed miserably. We are supposed to find these children friendly and kind. I found them bland and boring. The one I really hated was Ramon. He makes graffiti on subway trains and this is considered excellent. Excuse me? He disfigures a public property that is not his own to begin with. In addition, these "big" children have access to the electricity of the city to be able to organize a big dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh. We are therefore supposed to find a group of adorable and funny criminals. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can not support hip-hop. The songs were, at best, mediocre and non-stop! They play ALWAYS! I have reached the point of advancing rapidly in innumerable music numbers. (Cut out the music and you have a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are some imaginative numbers - the subway battle in the subway, a really funny number of Santa Claus and the climatic show of Roxy. If you like hip hop, here is your movie. But if you are looking for a good drama, forget it. Also, how did it get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of swear words in this.
