Okay, my friends, a serious moviegoer is expected to watch all kinds of movies, good and bad, and this film has put me to the test. I will not mince words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The game was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to improve this movie. Indeed, I wondered why I even bothered to see this rotten trash movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected was bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff so I can not avoid what should otherwise be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what really went wrong in this amateur film, except to say that the quality of the acting was, to put it politely, subpere. A serious moviegoer may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie. Other. stay home, do not waste your time, read a book, get chores, or get yourself a good sandwich.
