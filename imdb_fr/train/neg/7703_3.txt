A famous master of the show enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady has a heart attack. The murderous woman is called Sawa. She always goes to school and works for a bad criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa discovers that he has killed his parents. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest fans of cartoons will have to admit that this vicious crime movie is a disappointing gore fest. "Kite" has style, but it's still a trash. The strange plot about a teenager killing people while an assassin was trying to be scary and touching at the same time, just tipping the story flat on his face. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / bad heroine Sawa falls with a bodyguard of a building, but the dramatic structure is far from as well orchestrated and the strange and grotesque animation characters from the character of Yasoumi Umetsu is awful. Moreover, the sex sequences are simply scary. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
