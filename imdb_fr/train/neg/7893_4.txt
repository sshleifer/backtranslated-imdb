At first, we see the beginning of a secret council. Everything looks very promising right from the start. With some added supernatural elements, the mystery becomes more and more interesting. The main character who seems to be a good guy is in trouble because of his demand for money to which he is entitled (temptation) and other factors. You really understand the guy and you want to know exactly what is going on. Normally, a person in his situation would have several options. In one way or another, he does not have these options. In this film, there seems to be only one solution, although it is clear that it is not his fault. Unexpectedly, he meets characters who talk about church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to his problem. It should be obvious at some point in the film what this solution consists of. Let me now say that there is nothing wrong with this message. As it is always useful. But was it really necessary to conceal this message? This religious element actually messed up the viewing experience for me. Although the message is good, its simplicity can not escape the fact that, in real life, it takes even more to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery presented to us is never solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another subject that has essentially nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell. The brilliant actor is enough, but if you look closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He must really be desperate for money. If not, which actor would have an actor of his caliber to play in a film like this?
