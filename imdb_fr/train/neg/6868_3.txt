OK, certainly, as an orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'm going to be a bit biased against this movie. However, it seems that the only goal of Boaz Yakin in the realization of this film was to criticize the Orthodox. With our wigs, our modest clothes and our separate seats, we are already a pretty easy target. Yakin never crossed the surface. The result is a movie with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love her more than Gd or her parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order not to swim because of his poor health. 2. Sonia bends over her son's grandson. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a reaction? It is hard to believe that she has never attended an event before. Let's face it, even Reformed Jews are holding milah breaking ceremonies today. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his chosson lessons? He is supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing him in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street of Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for over a year and he just noticed they were not made for each other? A small clue - arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy with whom her parents have trained her. It will not be rejected by the community if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelery business, she would not have to go through her horny brother-in-law. There are women doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Orthodox. Sonia was more cranky than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat down and waited for things to happen, then complained that she did not like the result. It does not stand up to its environment; it is procrastinating stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
