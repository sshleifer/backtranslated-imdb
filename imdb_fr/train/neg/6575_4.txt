Interesting movie about a real event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. This kept my attention until the end and I do not regret having seen it. I never read any reports about this incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels were getting away with it. I appreciate the historical movies of that time. <br /> <br /> My main complaint concerns Confederate uniforms. They look too good !!! The acting was sometimes a little stiff. I love the old man eating mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier playing chore with a dog was a bit strange. Overall, it was a descent movie.
