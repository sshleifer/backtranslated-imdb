It was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Every film in the movie was trying to be serious, that's what made this movie so funny. I mean come on the head of a shark on a human body. Can it be funnier? Good job Science fiction keeps comedy movies going. I never thought that movies could be delayed. If they continue, they will have to rename the comic science fiction channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next big sci fi movie. <br /> <br /> I'll be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a box of beer or a bottle of liquor and I'll be ready to laugh again !!!
