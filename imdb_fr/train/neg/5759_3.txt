This is the third parody of horror movies and, hopefully, the last one. This time, the parody is mostly done on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for a strange reason. In my opinion, this movie was very useless and useless and not even funny. I have laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this one was just silly. If your jokes consist of corpses being beaten and people are constantly letting go, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay at home and save your money and please stop doing this kind of movies, they only get worse 3/10.
