Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a fan of Cher, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written. The cinematography was well done and captured a feeling of love. <br /> <br /> The Rest: A Thin Plot, Nicholas Cage's Performance, and a totally non-humorous, weak attempt to represent an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth, I felt myself cracking. I do not know what kind of accent he was trying to use. Honestly, this is not the case, for sure I have never heard of an Italian or New York accent. It was pretty surreal. And it's not because I'm fussy enough in terms of accuracy, his voice just crashes in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have a lot of Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York and, frankly, I had more laughs and I felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family that provided by this film. And it would be a boring night at home. What a desappointment.
