Final score (average of various classic cinematic qualities: game, actor, visuals, creativity, gain, humor, entertainment, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> Had " Atlantis: The Lost Empire ", a few years ago, it would have seemed like a new bold and serious direction in Disney's animation. However, it just comes a year after the awesome and innovative "The New Groove of the Emperor" and marks a step backwards to release Disney from its repetitive "Disney formula". I am a big fan of Disney feature films. I must see them all love or hate him. "Atlantis" is a lively return to "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures from the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version hardly contains an original idea. It sounds like a remake of something, even more than real Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than traveling clich√©s of the usual suspects who usually populate this kind of films (the mean mechanic, the general gung ho, the impertinent tough women). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the support cast is totally obnoxious. The film also suffers from its succinct rhythm. Rather than digging into an epic story, Disney spends a lot of time running, usually in a short time, sweeping away opportunities to develop ... suspense, characters, something really. They plunge us into this new and wonderful world and leave us barely exposed. The delicate rhythm sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dull and cheap. This thing looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they have not forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant", among others, proved it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: Visual effects, rhythm and lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Pluses: Perhaps the coolest death scene for a naughty Disney in a long time. This is the highlight of the film's creation.
