It must be one of the worst films ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's the bottom. The minimalist plot consists of a group of bikers taking control of a small town (what an originality!) And trying to fight against the townspeople. Why do not they call for outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously wrong. Adam West and Tina Louise are there but both have little to do and are ashamed to be there (which is understandable). This movie belongs to the trash!
