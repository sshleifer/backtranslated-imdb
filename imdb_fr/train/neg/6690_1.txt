I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. Honestly, I could not tell what kind of movie was this movie watching, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was non-existent and the acting was horrible. My friends and I managed to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before turning it off and asking the video store to pick it up. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you deliberately try to watch the worst movies of all time. Honestly, I do not know how this film lasted more than a day in the theaters and, furthermore, I do not understand why we would like to watch it, considering not only its very uninteresting title, but also the absence of famous actors / actresses in his casting. This review is not a joke and honestly, I think it could be the worst movie of all time. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever had to watch.
