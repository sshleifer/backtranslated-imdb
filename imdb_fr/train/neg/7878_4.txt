I am a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, he had trouble deciding whether it was a toon kiddie or an adult, which caused a strange mix of adult stories and quite violent scenes with a little duck an idiot who continues to give "fun" moments in the beginning. But this is not important, the film is simply boring, motionless and not faithful to the original story. He simply can not transfer into the picture all the points that Orwell has tried to put in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Did not the guys learn anything? Who is the next Napoleon? Benzoin?!!
