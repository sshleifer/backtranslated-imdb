I'm probably one of the few to have read Stephen King's book, the one on which this movie is based. After reading this great work, I'm looking forward to seeing his movie version. After watching the movie, I was TOTALLY disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is presented to a TV game show. The main object is to survive. But he is not in an arena. He is on the run in the city and has to escape the villains of the game show (I guess you would call them), who have absolutely no resemblance to the characters in the movie. This premise created a lot of tension and suspension and ended with the climax. The movie was an absolute trash. There was no cinematic quality. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he was wrong with this one.
