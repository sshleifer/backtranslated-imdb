Spoiler warning. . . I agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie, about such a true and interesting story. There was such a promise, but the acting was at best ridiculous. Some decorations were beautiful and realistic. Others are something of a theme park. I found myself laughing at what was supposed to be serious scenes. I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. The best part was the fight with friends that led to the death of the "King". I loved the punishment of queens. And, the last shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend that.
