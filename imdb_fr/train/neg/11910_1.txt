What is interesting is that the acting of the actors; was not bad, but not enough. It was rather bad, the special effects or the lines were the only ones responsible for this failure. Staying alone, they were not terribly bad, but assembled was a tragic gesture. The show seemed slow and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed up the film, but it completely failed. <br /> <br /> The uncertainty of this disaster has been largely attributed to the special effects.Do not believe it, They were pretty cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this company. Although it could be all they had to choose with a little bit of recognition from the fans. An experienced actress would have brought something to the role, as Appleby never did. Scfi is releasing very good original films, it's a shame that it has failed so radically.
