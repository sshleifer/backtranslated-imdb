I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers, the only laugh that made me laugh was when I realized I was really watching it. in a word, it's not funny. Unfunny. I am quite convinced that Jack Black apologizes for making this trash. I can not believe that Barry Levinson did not just throw this script when he read the first page. moreover, I can not believe that I have watched more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 out of 10 * because I love to see Christopher Walken doing terrible movies for pay. moreover, the horse "corky", only existing as a character in this film, is actually quite ridiculous.
