From time to time, a film depreciates me and reminds me that my tastes in the movies I want to watch are not always flawless. I would normally stay out of this stuff, but some rave reviews and Rohmer's pedigree tricked me. <br /> <br /> There is a first and intriguing novelty in the production where Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors to painted scenes (digital). ) the repercussions of the era of the revolution in France. This decreases rapidly and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint-by-number scene. What we have left is a boring and stifling film about the aristocrats of the 18th century in France. None of the characters are attractive or friendly. The pace is so languid, the dialogue so difficult, and the suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer, so I did not care who had the head that was spinning, who was hosting who, or what the hell was supposed to to be the revolution. The film would have greatly benefited from a semblance of accumulation of emotions and a score (there is good classical music used at the very end). Despite being so "chatty", the film plays a lot like a silent movie, and the worst kind of movie is a dull and uninspiring film about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find something to draw from this film, because it seems to be able to evoke in a new angle the well-known events (Lady is English and Royalist). Otherwise, avoid this yawning at all costs unless you have insomnia (I dozed off twice).
