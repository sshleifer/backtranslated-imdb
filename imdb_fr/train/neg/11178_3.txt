First of all, I must admit that this is not a good movie. And I would never watch this movie if Pacino was not there. <br /> <br /> The film talks about the strange 24 hours of a journalist. It's really boring, after 20 minutes, you could fall asleep.And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie.Just because of money or what? > Since I'm a big fan of Pacino, I bought this movie, 2002, People I Know. If you have not bought it yet, do not even think it's a waste of time.
