When a stupid little globe of space-age mastic land on the ground, it quickly starts to eat and gain weight. The only part of this insane behavior that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be sliced ​​and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing actually made $ 20 million? And McQueen's pay was 3K? All were very overpaid. The "monster" looked a lot like a big bitch and the "teenagers" felt like they could have children approaching their teenage years. And those explosions of the shotgun; looked like a shotgun with sound suppressor. The end was pitifully banal; obviously, the producers left the door open for a continuation ... and they were numerous. Thumbs down.
