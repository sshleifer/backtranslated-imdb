It may sound incredible, but this film brought in $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown in almost every movie theater and still works! Well, I do not know why distributors have set their sights on this "film", which has hardly been screened in the world. It's a kind of enigma! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another film, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which had only released a DVD almost everywhere, had major projections in Russia and brought in more than $ 1 million . In addition, both films had a lot of promotion, as there were banners throughout the city, TV commercials, and so on. Speaking of film, I would say that it is dull and absolutely boring. It could be better, really. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
