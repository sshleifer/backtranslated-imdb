First, I realize that a "1" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film comes to me from this film because, as a critic underlines, it is not bad if we know too much, which could allow him to have a comic or cult value. It is simply missing its mark on every account. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely wrong. The continuity is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel just finished talking about his lost love and, with his last word, the flamenco dancers start. The fictitious shock of her first name (see? I do not even remember her character's name, let alone the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) tells her for the first time that her friend is the bad guy . The car and the motorcycle lawsuits did everything necessary. Vegetable trolleys have gone flying. Cars crash into each other. The motorcycles go down the stairs. People are almost hit, but no one is doing it. Oh, that's right ... except that the guy who was repeatedly stabbed is visibly stumbling along the sidewalk with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently did not notice him. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It's becoming more and more remarkable for me to be able to make films like this one. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money that one would think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good movies that are worth seeing. Now, there is a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Do not look at it on the cable. There are many other things you could do that will leave you more satisfied.
