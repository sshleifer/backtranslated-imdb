I do not give much credence to conspiracy theories about AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of frightened and dying people were often at the root of bleak fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme halfworld of San Francisco. The city, renowned for its beauty, has rarely appeared as ugly as in this film. A feeling of darkness and decay permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> It can not be said that the acting and the plot are well done. The unique cultural context of the film and its oppressive and dark mood saves it in part at least a complete loss. In fact, I found that the most interesting performance was Irit Levi as a crisp and cynical detective of the Jewish and lesbian police. It's interesting, but not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The film uses Turandot as an effective motif and is an effective motif. There is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist Ron Athey.
