I'm watching this movie right now on WTN because it's the channel to which the TV was turned on when I turned it on. This is an unlikely story and rather boring about the wife of a minister (Alexandra Paul) who falls in love with a young stallion / wanderer (with ABS washboard) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey takes off her shirt a lot and Alexandra collapses. I feel he does not have to do much, and that's why he plays with lean Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because, as I said, he takes off his shirt a lot and I just saw the buttocks. There is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is painful.
