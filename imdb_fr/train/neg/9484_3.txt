If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was fun, and there are many good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital. He is excited and eager to "change the world". <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of In the movie, you know that the hospital hides a perverse truth, but James thinks he can make the difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story is building up pretty well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what patients are telling about resident evil, and you wonder when and how James will find out. Also, when the break comes, James is in some way hunted by the evil, and you feel a little suspense until "the fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful innocent girlfriend who arrives at the worst possible time and you get a complete picture. <br /> <br /> The activation of the character is actually quite good, you are introduced to most people who are killed, some that you "get to know". <The film depicts an unpleasant scene, it is also done quite well. There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James, is very believable. The story of an enthusiastic student who begins to work is in this context. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of the "Plan 9 of space" type (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad actions (or probably very few shots during the shoot) - The main characters sometimes act badly and sometimes well. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I thought all the time "I could make a movie like this with my personal video camera" throughout the movie.
