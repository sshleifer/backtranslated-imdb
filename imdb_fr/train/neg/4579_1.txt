"What do we know about sleep !?" It was one of the worst moments I had at the movies. It was less a film than a special one after school, but nothing special at the same time. The attempt of a story in which they based their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost everyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in his underwear just should not happen. I will not dwell on it. What I am going to reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. This film, although tedious, also suffered from a huge lack of reasoning. It was horribly contradictory, because you needed such a manipulator, become a creator of your life, a manifestation of abundance, a bottomless propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a large part of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with spirits who could control us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least, the structures in which we exist limit us greatly. In this way, the film was improperly solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity do not mix, unless you are God Almighty. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) By all the interesting things that this movie will reveal that you can do. Otherwise, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or maybe both. In addition, the title is so ridiculous that I find it hard to warn people not to see the film because I feel delayed to name it. Shame on everyone involved.
