Today, I found "They all laughed" on VHS for sale in a rental. It was a very old and very used VHS, I had no information about this film, but I liked the references mentioned on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten m ' attracted, the price was very low. down and I decided to risk it and buy it. I looked for IMDb, and the user rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in "2003 Mick Martin & Marsha Porter 2003 DVD and Video Guide" and ?? sensational ?? four stars! So I decided that I could not waste more time and saw it immediately. Indeed, I just finished watching "They All Laughed" and I found it very boring. The characters are poorly developed and I spent a lot of time understanding their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes falling in love for the women they pursue), but I did not laugh at the whole story. Coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as a seductive and very attractive man, with the women who fall on him as if it were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is pretty ridiculous. In the end, the major attraction is certainly the presence of the Playboy Central and Playmate of the Year, Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband after the release of this film, and whose life was shown in " Star 80 "and" Death of a Centerfold: The Story of Dorothy Stratten "; the incredible beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even to be fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo" by Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like it, Roberto Carlos is the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60's and is called by his fans "The King". I will keep this film in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso and Muita Alegria" ("Lots of laughter and a lot of happiness")
