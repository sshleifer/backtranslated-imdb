In Steve Irwin's show, he's hillarious. He does not even try to be funny, but he does, but his movie was not even what I would call a movie. I mean, when this guy on his car tries to kill him, he just says, man! and looking directly into the camera. He put his face too much in the camera! And then when the guy falls out of the car, do not you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting game I have ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve, she just says "Steve." She did not look scared or anything, it was just 'Steve'. I mean, I hate to look mean, but it was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was too stupid.
