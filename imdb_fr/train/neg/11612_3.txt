Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his debut, this film is played for funny laughs. On a diving trip, Rome discovers the body of a beautiful blonde at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you would expect, wrapped in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by mountain man Waldo Gronsky. Rome is immediately in danger because he must investigate certain types of mafia, who turn against him and he is himself the main suspect. He must now go on the run and hope to solve the case on his own. The fat Sinatra is trying to sell us those lame jokes and make us believe he's a good, oh, and not to say sexually attractive detective for fox Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably in this vanity project. of ham. The frankly laughable ending that surrounds every woman is pretty amazing, every woman in the movie is a shaking head, who likes to lean in front of the camera, the director Douglas is of course forced to zoom in on the crack of their ass every time . flex their hind muscles. There is even a ridiculously campy gay person who begs for belief. This is a film made by "real men" for "real men" to reaffirm their own endangered sexuality, it is a shameful ruckus.
