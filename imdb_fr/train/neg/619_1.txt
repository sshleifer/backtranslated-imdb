WOW is all I can say if your reading is watched or if you think about it. Believe me, look at him! <br /> <br /> I laughed so much about so many parts of this movie that the worst acting game of all time is very funny! I can not believe they superimposed the school sign! I had to play this scene again and again just to laugh more and more each time. If a film like this one can be made, it gives us all the hope of creating our own movies. even the costume was bad. it seemed that my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job of doing it. heck, I bet he could write and act better too. All I know is that I have to watch the second part so I can see if it was as bad as the first one. It's a good idea of ​​a killer scarecrow, but a much better job could have been done. I hope another killer scarecrow movie comes out, but not like this one.
