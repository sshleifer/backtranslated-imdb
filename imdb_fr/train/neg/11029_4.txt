Anyone who has visited drive-ins in the 50s, 60s and 70s must have seen a movie or two from American International Pictures, a distributor resembling the 1980s giant, Cannon Films. Wherever the film lovers are, AIP would be there to provide the latest titles in vogue. In the 50s, horror movies appeared, such as "Voodoo Woman" and "The Undead". in the '60s, Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello had comedies on the beach and biker movies like' The Glory Stompers'; and until the 1970s, the IPA produced garbage such as "Cannibal Girls" and "Sugar Hill". <br /> <br /> "Dillinger," published in 1973, is one of AIP's most ambitious efforts capturing the true spirit of filming drive-in; it is one of those uneven and exaggerated films that have satisfied the thirst for entertainment, know-how and good sense of the masses. Overall, "Dillinger" is typical of his time: entertaining and worth a few hours, but certainly not unforgettable. Dillinger was a commendable effort by writer-director John Milius ("Magnum Force"), but he certainly left room for improvement in his long career. <br /> <br /> The 109-minute film "Dillinger" - an epic for AIP - follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis, starring Oscar winner Ben Johnson. Purvis was the investigator seeking revenge for four FBI agents killed in an ambush in Kansas City in 1933 that allowed gangster Frank Nash to escape justice. Among the men alleged to have participated in this breakthrough were bank expert John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Kanaly) and psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss). Dillinger finally joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Geoffrey Lewis). He also met Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a prostitute of French and Indian origin. While it took place over several months in 1933-1933, 'Dillinger' is essentially a hunting film, the entourage of Purvis seeking to kill and kill the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places, while Johnson provides a vague narrative like Purvis. Milius keeps an honest look of depression, using fashion, cars, weapons and authentic buildings; He also has black-and-white ideas and gangster archive footage. The film is never boring, it moves at a fast pace. Action scenes are Dillinger's strong point, proficiently edited by Fred Feitshans Jr in his latest professional effort. Thousands of blank cartridges must have been used to make this film, not to mention kilos of explosives. This film is certainly not for dummies, with people being shot and falling dead everywhere. The violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the chaos that organized crime has thrown on American life. <br /> <br /> This film never transcends its exploitation status, because the necessary writing is simply not there. John Milius, a little overrated as a filmmaker, puts too much emphasis on action. The action scenes (mostly shots filled with blood) are impressive and comparable to any great crime movie of its day, including "Bonnie and Clyde" from 1967. But we simply do not know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship between Dillinger and Fr√©chette is hardly mentioned, the couple meeting in a bar during a scene and having fun in love just ten minutes later. Melvin Purvis also seems to be entering and leaving the screenplay, becoming a prominent figure only when Milius must prevent the film from collapsing. Too often, the film takes on the appearance of a filmer when his characters have been explored in detail. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the main crime of the film is the ignorance of the historical facts. Although many say that "Dillinger" is just a movie, it's movies like this that create fables and make them permanent. Those who know the story of gangsters will point out that John Dillinger is not the last of his group to die, the scenario of Milius and the documentary style of the film urging us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; It was also said that he did not carry a firearm on the night of his death and that Billie Frechette was not accompanied. Although these inaccuracies may give rise to dramatic dramas, nothing prevents Milius from remaining faithful to the facts and writing a beautiful story around them. <br /> <br /> Warren Oates' performance as Dillinger is pretty good, although he sometimes seems unconvincing. Oates is humorous and describes how Dillinger was absorbed by his larger-than-life image in the American press. However, we never really feel the threat he invoked in his lifetime. Ben Johnson gives a little life to Purvis, sweet but rather flat. Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the character of Billie Frechette and it is really a pity that the scenario of Milius did not specify its relation with Dillinger. One never learns what attracted him to a cold-blooded murderer, other than the stereotype of an easy going girl, attracted by men in danger. The supporting roles with Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis and Cloris Leachman, which appear briefly, are acceptable for such talent. <br /> <br /> In the context of a 1970s exploitation, 'Dillinger' seems to be condemned to retail sale. which is exactly where I picked up the DVD version of MGM for $ 4.99. The film is well presented on the big screen (a must for movies in drive) with subtitles in French and Spanish. Dillinger's theatrical trailer is provided separately. Widely forgotten, except by moviegoers and drive-in enthusiasts, the film does not claim much more. For fans of the genre, it's worth the detour. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4 <br /> <br /> Traveling Author - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
