With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space", how can you go wrong? Add some stereotypes to the characters, use the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and add tons of gay gags. Land is unimportant. Too bad, this movie contains nothing of this and every joke misses the place. The characters are all alike except the German gaynigger, one or two jokes walk, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more about the movie. My expectations were too high apparently.
