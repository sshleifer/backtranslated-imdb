This "film" is a parody. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is without a doubt the worst film of all time, featuring characters worshiped, created and established by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) was replacing Peter Sellers. was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is asin and breathless. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have died since 1957 and 1965, respectively. One might wonder why anyone could even begin to imagine that appropriate updates for L & H would be in the character of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain. I agreed to fully expect to be horrified and embarrassed and certainly not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic shame, stupid, should be excluded from everything associated with Hollywood and filmmaking. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST - YOU HAVE ALSO BEEN AWAITED.
