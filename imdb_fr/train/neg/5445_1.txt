Ooof! This one was a stink. It's not somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller, that's for sure. In fact, it is somewhere between the slits of a Wham! video and Captain EO, only with such a reduced budget, and many more close-ups of ugly teenagers in tears. Simon Le Bon is at the forefront, while the rest of the group tries to hide the fact that they have stolen their entire career in the last 3 albums of Roxy Music. Short clips of Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the role when they were playing 'Hungry Like The Wolf' but why was there a tiger hidden in the audience that changed to a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they do not sing 'Eye of the Tiger' or 'Hungry like the tiger' it's a wolf! It does not matter.) A DVD of Duran Duran's 80's videos is probably worth a look for the sake of nostalgia
