It's a really stupid movie in this typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptually, it looks like Rush Hour but it completely lacks the action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters in this movie. I appreciate Jay Leno as a presenter and talk show host, but he just can not do it. He is awful when he tries to act with rigor - he barely manages to keep this brand of fabulous smile while saying his interlocutors who, by the way, are not very funny. And to see him running (even at the time) is not nice to see. In addition, I feel that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Do not even tell me about the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
