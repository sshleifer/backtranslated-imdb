For the first 20 minutes or so (I watched it on a PS2, so I really do not know how long it took) Alienator puts up an interesting premise. I do not think I've ever seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as a villain. However, the interest quickly turns into a stunned disbelief when you realize that "the stranger" is a huge female bodybuilder in steel bikinis. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Do not think I'm against it. In the horror world of shlock, a ridicule can often be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of its principle is all that the movie really has to go. Alienator is funny like hell, but it's also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. The actors accumulate the failed attempts at seriousness, potentially brilliant lines of dialogue about pure cheese are traced with disconcerting incompetence and the direction does not sum up even one or two decors suitable. At the end of the movie, you can barely see the original concept through the haystacks haystack that the team has piled on. <br /> <br /> Add to that the fact that "the Alien" kills people by spraying them, instead of doing any "slashing" as such and you have a lot of good throbbing ideas giant left to rot. You'll laugh at Alienator, but not at her. If that's your thing, go ahead, take a look at it.
