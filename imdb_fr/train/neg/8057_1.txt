What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. The editors try too hard to look good and only confuse the viewer while providing a powerful headache. The plot is confused and obviously prolonged compared to what started as a short film (story or film). The plot is less than ten minutes of good story, and it stretches painfully to the minimum length of a feature film. We all know what happens when we extend them, right? Exactly. They lose weight. In the end, the plot is so thin that you may even miss it, if you're not careful, which is hard to do when you watch this movie. The acting is not even impressive. The characters are poorly written and dull, without interest. One of the worst things about this movie is that apparently the head of the score / soundtrack was not unaware of what the movie was or what it was supposed to be (not that I blame, I could not understand it either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit the scene at all. Also, what was there with all the sexual nuances between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, it was for the purpose of attracting young men, but it was done at a lower cost. And did the first scene have something to do with the rest of the movie? At any level imaginable? At all? The two scary guys did not seem to have any connection to the movie, they were just there to have pursuit scenes. I doubt that anyone would really appreciate such a badly staged film and such a shameful and horrible attempt at Hollywood to have a pretty interesting idea. But I go astray. I recommend it to unattractive teens who do not fear a very bad horror thriller as long as there is sex and gore (although this may only be true for Killer Cut, which I saw). 1/10
