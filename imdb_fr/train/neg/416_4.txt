(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were great. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme: invisibility. Every premise for a good movie has been fulfilled. Unfortunately, these things did not matter. The film was very very week, without suspense and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> This is a group of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After the animal tests are successful, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once invisible, it changes completely, realizing the benefits of not being seen. From there to murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. He suffers from the illness that many new movies have: special effects. From a stimulating theme that could have led producers to a tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything while focusing solely on special effects, regardless of the actual value of the film. I must admit that the special effects are great, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. In fact, that's the problem with cinema today. Just like Verhoeven, most filmmakers are only interested in spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very rare and probably Matrix is ​​the only movie combining fabulous special effects and a superb plot. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven is again disappointed. Instead of a big movie, HM is cr * p. You can only watch this movie for two reasons: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil you this moment ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, so what was wrong with the film? All. Let's see what I remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not at all tense. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - Very many shots. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the villain wakes up several times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- As in any horror of poor quality, the first rule is the characters separate as much as possible. Whenever there is someone alone in the lab, ideal victim of Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- A few holes in the plot. Example: At the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he's invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls to the ground. floor. Then Shue and Brolin leave slowly and slowly, without turning around. Is this normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then Shue yells "I heard an explosion" (arrived a few minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Did not she hear that explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven, I was expecting a lot more from you! <br /> <br /> It's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a good movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
