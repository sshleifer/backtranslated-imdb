Nightmare Weekend is irrefutable proof that some people are so ready to make movies that they are ready to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to look completely Starkers in this horrible basket (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing should be ashamed). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star with a hand-made puppet called George. Now it's embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> A bioelectronic created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a crazy felt clown with green wool for the hair) is the intelligent artificial interface for a system advanced computer that uses a revolutionary device (a silver sphere the size of a golf ball) that, once ingested, can reverse personality disorders. <br /> <br /> Edward's manipulation of personality experiments have been successful in the laboratory. animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects, fearing that there may still be side effects. Her nasty assistant, Julie (Debbie Laster), does not have that kind of scruple and uses three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into mutants hideous killers. <br /> <br /> With cheap special effects, a totally talent-free cast and an almost impossible plot to follow (I took notes while watching the movie, and even then, I'm not all in fact convinced that my resume is accurate), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and total disaster that even several soft-core sex scenes and a touch of gore can not save. <br /> <br /> This movie It also features one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a smug-clad walkman for 80s music in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake.
