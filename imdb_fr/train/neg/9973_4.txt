"Problem Child" is one of the craziest movies ever made. It's not the worst (although some people will disagree with me about it), but it's not the best either. This is a devilish boy of 7 years who makes comic ravages on a couple without children (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who adopt it stupidly. This film is too stupid and incredible because I do not buy for a second that a child can behave as badly as the child in this film. It's stupid and absurd even though I laughed a lot (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm too nice to her. If there is one positive thing about "Problem Child", it's better than the sequel that was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
