I do not know if the problem I have with this film is that I have not been able to capture the way movies were shot in the past, but I think it has not failed to make use of the fashionable conventions available in the 40's to make a movie. If you have nothing better to do, I advise you not to watch this movie, but to read a book or walk around.
