"Freddy's Dead" did the smart thing he could have done after the disappointment of the fifth movie. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" film of the saga is silly, but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a little breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's (Lisa Zane) daughter's return to town to face her evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is nothing more than another cartoon designed to bring children to the theater. He has a group of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who look fundamentally stupid and wander like sheep ready to be slaughtered. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick and, in the end, it's just a joke, a childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
