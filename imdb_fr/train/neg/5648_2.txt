Boston legal turned his tail and headed for the door of the barn and the pig he created! When this program aired for the first time nearly four seasons back, it was a humorous slap against the justice system that all actors seem to be proud to represent. It was funny, diverse and, to some extent, factual. The characters described were acceptable and, to a certain extent, real in their representations. The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series in which she participated, but she is now drawn into the depths of media programming about sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Ren√© Adjurdubois is an excellent actor who, since the time of "Benson" until his production, has made a name for himself in the field of entertainment, always showing the humor and respectful play of production. Captain Kirk "is". Candace Bergan is funny and humorous. She must be admired for her continuation in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, his acting talent is no doubt, but he should return to his XXX origins such as "Crash" because he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in this direction. We ask that this series be discarded as it already is and that it really starts to smell !!!
