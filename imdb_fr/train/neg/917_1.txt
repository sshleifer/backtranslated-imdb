This film was made in very bad taste. The script was really bad. I am really sad for the late Gregory Peck, who has taken on the lead role in this film adaptation of one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in the Second World War. There was a scene where I almost vomited. She showed Macarthur in a bunker on the island of Corregidor talking to the troops as a senior politician a Filipino soldier injured in one leg. The bleeding and dying soldier manages to sit upright on seeing the general and says "no dad, no mom, no uncle sam" and Macarthur gave his encouraging little speech that the Americans "would never give up" the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier invigorated by Macarthur's words and gives him an intelligent salute. I mean, if a more condescending scene described the United States as the great white savior of the world, tell me, because this one takes the cake. It appears that Filipinos are damsels in distress unable to honor and that they must rely only on the great Americans to redeem themselves. He deliberately and deliberately overshadowed the contributions of the USAFFE (American Armed Forces of the Far East) members, who are Filipino volunteers who were integrated into the US military during the Second World War and who are The Japanese, who were walking side by side with the Americans in the Bataan death march, defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur's departure for Australia with his famous speech "I will return". My late grandfather, a World War II Filipino veteran and USAFFE soldier, was one of many fighters who fought the Japanese with honor and love for their home country. I do not think that this film does them any credit, any more than the thousands of other people on whom Macarthur relied for the preparation of intelligence for his famous return to the Gulf of Leyte.
