We can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this movie was too much. Virtually nothing was close to the truth, and even for the time, it was considered stupid. <br /> <br /> In the defense of ford, it was revealed during an old talk show that he played the role of the real Wyatt Earp, obviously elderly, senile, repeated the scene to him way. Earp informed the director of the diligence and the way it was planned when he arrived in the stagecoach. Thus, despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself claims that it was premeditated. man, and also his brothers. The story does not say exactly whether they were or not. Most people like to introduce some deception and anarchy into their characters, but it's not new. The truth is probably closer to them as being the respectful kinds of law of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. The men who have seen a career, and believe me, in the old west, you have not had time to think of anything else. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters represented dying corral, who did not really make it, makes it a weaker movie. He is still weakened by Mature, who has not made a convincing Doc. It is perhaps the worst casting choice for Doc, but we must not forget either that the older films were closer to the time and closer to the meaning of the truth. After all, Ford has received first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> He is also weakened by the so predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi at the time and ready to kill brown women in a very predictable way to show their support for Hitler's idealism. This happens in most movies until the eighties. This is not an excuse and does not depreciate art, however. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always happy. In fact, Mature is perhaps the only drawback of this movie. Still, it's the weakest old OK Corral movie.
