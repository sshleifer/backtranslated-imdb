Unfortunately, I agree with the review written by Halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film, the cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very very good. It may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical team that worked there was made up of professionals, so we had to expect an irreproachable quality. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of cinema, SHOW a story), you need intrigue and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: the events. These events occur because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problem or purpose. It is a kind of supernatural entity that observes humanity. That's all. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of showing a story, we simply learn about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, given the particular nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give sufficient background to him for the film to use voiceover narration. In this case, it is used in the worst sense possible, which is to give information that we would never glean otherwise. In fact, without the voice, we would think that the character is just a weird old man who looks everywhere. To make matters worse, the VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The images we are showing are just a decoration for the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I could say that this short film would make a good video for a group or something like that, but because the images are not. t stand on their own, it is impossible to say that. What remains of course has value as a measure of the technical abilities of the crew (not incredible, but good), but fails to entertain, amuse, shudder or, at the very least, to show a story.
