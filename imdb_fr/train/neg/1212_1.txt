All in all, this movie is dreadful and should never have been done. One of the problems with this film is that there is no connection to the audience and the characters, for example, if it is about to be attacked, you want to feel "Oh my God, no!" But you do not do it in this case, you do not care, because no link has been created to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed that the movie would be great, but there is no suspense really. There may be a mystery but there is not one. "All she has is a toolbox." has been said on the back of the DVD, one would think that this film was carefully planned and intelligently realized, but it is not, The end is horrible, very simple, and useless too. The acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a loss of one hour of my life. The "special effects" and the sets were also average, nothing special. There is not a lot of bloody or bloody violence, not a lot of blood is shown. This movie was announced to give a rather surprising sound, but in reality, it is not even worth looking for, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by some fights and a story boring.
