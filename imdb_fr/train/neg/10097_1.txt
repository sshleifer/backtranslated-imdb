I stopped at BB and picked up 4 zombie movies to watch this weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be tacky, the mediocre actors play and the suspicious trays. So I do not expect much. But he should at least have a story. Stories cost nothing but time ... apparently, they did not have the time either. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies appeared towards the end of the film that all looked like new prostitutes. The image of the zombie on the cover is NEVER displayed in the movie. It was absolutely painful to watch and I did not have anything to offer. <br /> <br /> The duration of the film is only 81 minutes, but the time was 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since it was on the computer in another room), it looked like zombie porn .... which, if you think about it, seems a bit rude .... but it was not so good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the writer may have tried to do too many things and ended up in an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> This ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
