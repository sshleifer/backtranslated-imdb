A kind of family parody mixing "An officer and a gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and probably other films I can not remember now) in a rather dull film, with some points luminous. The gags are always where you expect, and Damon Wayans lines are predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
