*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you were to review the movie based on the principle, you might think that you are watching an animal-oriented horror movie. The plot is this. A group of documentary filmmakers travel to an island to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or surfing. (I live in South Africa, so the movie came out under the name of "Blood Surf".) Certainly, there seems to be a pretty interesting idea behind that, if it were explored further, could have somewhat improved the movie. However, this is not the case because the part of the film that surfs the blood is minimal because of the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The scenario is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is that every time someone gets eaten by the crocodile, which is common in this movie, no one seems to care. The greatest number of people in the film was simply to grill the victim in a scene that was supposed to be poignant but that in the end was laughable because the dialogue in this movie was of a highly dubious nature. Another thing that really annoys about this movie is the fact that they introduce totally superfluous characters into the movie itself. They introduce a group of pirates who can only add 10 minutes to a short film. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the acting is mediocre. It would probably have been a lot more impressive if they had not had such a terrible script to work on. Overall, there is not one person who has had a terrible impact on me. Each person seemed to be a caricature diluted and, in this way, none of these actors inflicted any impact. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile itself is huge, more than 10 meters exactly. and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they provided us in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously false and artificial that it turns the stomach. With a huge cry of bravery, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that turns out to be falling from a hill and to ensure that the crocodile impaled on a peak fortunately placed at the bottom of said hill . <Br/> <br /> All in all, I would say that this film should be seen so that you can believe how much it could be. What seemed likely to be a good idea at the time was suffering from a terrible scenario and a lack of budget, all of which served to create a truly horrible movie.
