There are extremely talented black directors, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and a host of others who bring a well deserved credit to the film industry. Then there are the Wayans brothers who, at one time (15 years ago), had presented an extremely funny television show called In Living Color, which notably launched Jim Carrey's career. Now, we have the nonsense of replacing humor and unreasonable gags (toilet humor) as a standard procedure. People are not as stupid as those represented in "Little Man", they could not be. A baby with a complete set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as having only a few months? Baby comes with a five-hour shadow that he shaves. It is suggested that the baby has sex with his adoptive mother behind her husband, Darryl's, back. Oh, it's just hilarious. As a big criminal, Little Man is the most stupid on the planet Earth. He hides a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's bag and must then pursue it. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best sentence: "I'm surrounded by morons." Based, without credit, on a drawing by Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. It's way too stupid to be funny, even from a distance. One clue to the seriousness of this film is that Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night before the BAT Awards and he did not even mention this dreadful movie. When will Hollywood stop green lighting Wayans Brothers waste? When they have overcome their guilt in the white man, in all probability.
