Playing was weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with it if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was an awkward and obvious ploy to exploit the adoration of children by most people. OK fine. Fast forward to "the place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. OK, cool - it will be a supernatural horror story, with things that are partly rotting in our world partly in ... anywhere. Then the action begins to fire like a three-headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds - is there an evil force that tries to attack them directly? Is there a perverse force that is trying to attack them directly: to incite people to do horrible things that they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psychic echo chamber where the ambient discord can turn into murder? OK, wait - maybe it's really just a redneck boy with mentally tangled "Delbert" who misses his mom and who's like a party like a K-Tel's Norman Bates to die for? Oh, yes - more points: the only black character seems to be the grandson of a pullman carrier "Our Gang". The actor plays the game as straight as he can given the lousy dialogue, but the fact is that his goal is "You're done, go, go, Boss, Boss!" At least they wrote him smart enough for the GTF to come out. The bite of the little girl who was silenced and was walking away was really scary, just like the girl in the shower. These are just two of the very good things in this movie. The problem is that they are combined disharmoniously, like a mouthful of steak, a mouthful of chocolate and a bite of a teddy bear. Everyone is great, but mixed? Bleah! Such potential. Lost.
