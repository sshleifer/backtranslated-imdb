Whatever Guy Ritchie possessed to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. When I saw it, there was another person in the audience and she left about an hour later. (I hope she asked for a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end was because I never got out of a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat through this piece of junk completely stunned that Madonna and Ritchie might think they made a good movie. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only good thing in this film is the set. Ritchie took Lina's film and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie you would not even lose time watching late at night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted in shit like this.
