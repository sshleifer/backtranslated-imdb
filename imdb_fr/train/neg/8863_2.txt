Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 of the first film. While the first film was campy and scary. The second was skinny and nerdy. The production values ​​of it are rather bad and the acting is atrocious. The presenter's brother, the werewolf of the first part, wants to know what happened to his sister. The "scene" of the first film was badly recreated. A skinny, straightforward woman accompanies a brother (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to discover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a kind of wise / guide of the two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear under the name of Stirba, the chief werewolf of Romania. She is also suffering from a bad case of the morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I am surprised that Philippe Mora realized this image because he is generally a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that it takes a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content, but the film stock itself). To finish the film, you get a lousy "punk" representation of a damned wannabe "Babel". Maybe if they paid a few extra dollars, they could have found the real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid this if you are desperate or if you have lost the remote control and you are too lazy. to change the channel.
