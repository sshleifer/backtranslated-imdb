I agree with most other guys. A loss of photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is worth writing. The only highlight of my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This is reminiscent of the good old days with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performances of the actors, because most of them do not even seem to have fun during the production and are content to "do their job". The camera is OK, the plot is laughable, I think you would be ashamed even if you discussed it with a lot of beer. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I yawned all the time, wondering how a script like this could be considered for production and waited for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is happy with so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> In any case, a score of 1 point here is almost 1 point too much ...
