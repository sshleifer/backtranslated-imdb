After the superb AANKHEN (2002) which was a remake of a play in Gujarati, he arrives with WAQT, which also looks like a play. <br /> <br /> In the plays, we have characters who shout and react here in the same way <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh joking almost forty-something Akshay Kumar who makes too funny like a little nerd <br /> <br /> The film has a good message: how not to spoil your son but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible, it's absolutely wrong <br /> <br /> Even the reason he hid his illness, his escape from the hospital and Akki's melodramatic speech is a rebound <br /> <br /> Feelings you touch but most are too much above > <br /> The comedy of Rajpal is hilarious but too tense in the second half <br /> <br /> The realization of Vipul Shah is too exaggerated although some scenes are good The music is ok <br /> < Among the actors, Amitabh exaggerates in the first period but it is superb in the scenes excites Akshay Kumar also does his part, but seems at ease in some scenes too with his chemistry with Bachchan is incomparable Rajpal is a climax, he makes you laugh without reacting too much and just his presence and stupid behavior and impassive humor , there is a riot Boman is good in some comic parts but too noisy at places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do is his last film with Akki so far. Shefali is great although she looks too young for Bachchan
