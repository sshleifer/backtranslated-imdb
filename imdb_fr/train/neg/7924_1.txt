Ted V. Mikels' Corpse Grinders 2 film contains 103 minutes of unsustainable cinematic scenes. The plot is pretty much a mixture of absurd commercial relationships between people crushing cadavers in cat food while aliens, who are losing the war with aliens, are looking for food for cat. Watching this film, I began to look for any kind of distraction, something that reassures me that I was doing something other than losing the reason of the inside of the interior. <br /> <br /> Many scenes last too long, as the characters take forever to do simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikels did not like to use jumping cups too often, fearing to confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". In spite of all my efforts, I could not deal with any of the characters in the unnecessarily large cast, with the possible exception of the old men who are the guardians of the factory. The majority of the cast is talented amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics of "Amazing Grace" before having to sing them on camera. The quality of the sound is probably the cause of the problem, because I heard only about 80% of the dialogues by viewing the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst film to have been shot. I have listened to excerpts from the commentary, and Mr. Mikels presents himself as an old man of surprising gentleness. Why the hell was he doing this kind of rubbish? I would like to hear the explanations of the old men who had to lie on a metal conveyor waiting to be crushed. The movies I hate for a long time suddenly seem a lot better. I long for the appropriate intermittent music of Excalibur and the constant lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I have to go do something, anything. Do not see this movie.
