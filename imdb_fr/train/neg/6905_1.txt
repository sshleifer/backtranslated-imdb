Polynesian men clich√©s drink, argue and make a profusion of remarks sexist, stupid and insignificant. Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The so-called Samoan girl looked nothing like Samoan, did not look like this. With water-like stories, you can not say anything about acting - even the brightest actors can not do anything with this scenario. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film that does not have a good scene and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers money, what a lost opportunity to make a great movie about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they are as bad and stupid.
