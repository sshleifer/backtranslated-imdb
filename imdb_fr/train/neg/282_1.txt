What was an exciting and quite original series of Fox has deteriorated into sinuous guts. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my "must see" list of the week, not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fox's leaders decided they needed to "refine" the plot. In the 3 episodes of the opening of the season, they totally lost me as a spectator (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters added to the second season too ridiculous and too amateurish. The new intrigues stretched the continuity and credibility of the show too much. On one of the episodes of the second season, they even made sleep and dream Max - the first season stating that she could not biologically sleep. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (the one Hollywood never gets): If it works, do not screw with it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
