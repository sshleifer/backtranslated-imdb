While on vacation at the beach, red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The guys baptize their bestseller "Sammy" and spend the summer frolicking with the sandy sea lion. When it's time to go home, the boys start to suffer separation anxiety. The young Mr. McGreevey decides they can not bring "Sammy" back to "Disneyland" ?? uh, "Gatesville" - but young Mr. Mumy packs him anyway. At home, they try to hide the "exit seal" from adults, and of course ?? diversions ensue! ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *************************** Sammy Sammy - The Seal of Exit, pt 1
