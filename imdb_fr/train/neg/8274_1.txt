Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, the legs of Jessica Simpson and ... that's about it! <br /> <br /> I believe that a guy from an unidentified marketing department had an idea. Essentially, let's do some kind of Legally Blond film, but do it in New York. This great city of opportunity, power and money, where everyone is a heartless person, hungry for power / money. Add to that Jessica Simpson, little town bimbo, this brother of Owen Wilson and for no apparent reason Andy Dick (only because of him, you should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Basic story: <br /> <br /> A boy leaves his girl for New York, a girl follows, a cheating boy, a girl stays in New York with her cousin, gets a employment under false pretenses, gets dirty, gets courted by another boy (Brother Wilson) and manages to save the day. Wink. <br /> <br /> A few words come to mind when thinking about this movie, namely: terrible, terrible, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, you will be happier. One critic spoke of Guantanamo and I totally agree with him. This film induces a shock. And I know what you think ... at least, at some point, will I see Simpson naked or nearby? It will not happen, save time and YouTube. You will have a better sexy moment! <br /> <br /> The film editing is fragile, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion; This is a cinematic treason that should be punished to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Another question as to why Willie Nelson still plays some kind of father figure in almost every film by Jessica Simpson and why is there no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?
