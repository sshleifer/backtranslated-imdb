Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the SNL gang have set new highs with the sketch format, it fails miserably at all levels. Fortunately, Chevy is hardly in the game and can not be held responsible for these guts. It's really very serious. Although supposed to be a political commentary on the United States at the time of its publication (1974), it is still neither funny nor extremely observed. The skits are too long and any satirical impact they may have is lost because they are all trained to total boredom. This is credited as Chevy's first film and I'm happy to say that everything he did after that improved it. Avoid even if curious.
