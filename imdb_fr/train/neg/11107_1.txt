It was a terrible movie. There was no story whatsoever. To top it all off, when they could not explain the blood and the gore (the only good part) ... they added some extraterrestrials! I hate when the directors (or anything) lack ideas and then accuse extraterrestrials! Watch this movie if you like. But do not say that I did not warn you. Two things: how did Vinny say "welcome" when he had no language? It's unfortunate that Mr. Jones did not have a bigger role. The second thing that bothered me, why were we shown the Vinny Jones boils and he cuts them and puts them in a blue liquid, so that does not matter anymore? Why not? I do not like to be shown anything and it has nothing to do with history. In short. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I would have liked to watch Mirrors instead.
