Horrible film. About a crusty old painter who hangs out with a girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil follows the moves on his part and presents some of the most secret lines in the history of cinema. Richard Burton is close to death in this movie, and we are supposed to believe he looks "Good for sixty". The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are awful, just like the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porn cinema and plays on Tatum, he's pretty funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, like me - that's why I rented it in the first place - do not see this movie, please. She is really mean and you will wonder if PAPER MOON was a stroke of luck. This was not the case, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS, we know she can play well, but do not rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent a ticket when it was beautiful, not a fossil.
