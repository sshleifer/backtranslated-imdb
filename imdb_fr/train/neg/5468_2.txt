I absolutely love the 'Toxic Avenger' series, but this low offer from the Troma people made no sense, and it made me yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A leaking nuclear power station (and the growth of young Tromaville High go crazy, which pushes them to be part of a gang, to have sex, to explode, etc.) , there is a kind of monster reproducing in high school ... My God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors practically stopped their efforts after this one and they should Overwork (expected) started to get upset in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing 2/10.
