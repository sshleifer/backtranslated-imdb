The film is a little tedious. It is mainly a silent film, with most of the story provided through a series of dubbing. Making a silent movie like this is not such a bad idea, it's one of those films where the lack of dialogue and the first repetitive scenes make it just tedious. You do not understand the reason for the boredom before you get into the picture, and it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie are a kind of slow piece of Mexican soft porn, and unimaginative soft porn. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it is too late because the public is lost. There are beautiful shootings at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wondered why there were not more movies shot there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields, which gives it a feeling of another world. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / scriptwriter has designed the film as he wished, regardless of how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the public when you tell a story.
