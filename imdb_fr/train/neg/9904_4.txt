The movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of the Raiders of Makin Island in Carlson was made in 1943 with the aim of strengthening the morality of the American people during the Second World War. This shows that cinema can be a propaganda body. The value of this film is only a collection and not artistic. In a propaganda film, it is useless to judge the direction and the actors. Watch this film if you want to know how propaganda works in movies or if you have a lot of fun with Robert Mitchum, who plays a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie about the second world war, they exist much better and are objective. I noted it 4/10.
