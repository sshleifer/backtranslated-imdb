A friend of mine loaned me this video and I was pretty excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of slow singing by James Hetfield and Lars knocking on his drums in what seemed like a slow movement, I started to think: I'm looking at this? This question will cross your mind in 5 ?? 10 minutes after pressing Play. I returned the tape the same day, as you can imagine, it is not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
