The first movie is pretty good. This one is bad enough. <br /> <br /> Recycle many images (including the opening credits and the final title) of Criminally Insane. The new images, shot in video, seem really badly done. The scenes lack light, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video problems such as scrolling images, etc. <br /> <br /> Like all the bad consequences, it only repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills everyone who lives in her living space, often for reasons that interfere with the food she wants. <br /> <br /> At least, it's only an extra on the DVD for the first one, which also includes Satan's Black Wedding's directorial film. Too bad it does not include Death Nurse movies.
