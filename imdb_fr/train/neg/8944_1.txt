I saw this movie last year in media course and I must say that I really hated it. I was 10 years old (and 15 years old), so it might have something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also from George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book and I hated it too. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I ever had. never seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most disturbed people that has ever existed on this planet. I'm sorry for all those who liked his work, but unfortunately not The themes of the film were well portrayed, but the way the whole film was shot and the events that took place there did not fit my criteria. This is just my opinion and I'm sure many other people have really enjoyed this movie.
