What can I say is a brilliant film that should have won an Oscar? A copy must be kept in a secure vault for posterity. This should be mandatory for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the author / director / producer / chef / guardian / guardian / walmart greeter the most awesome who has ever honored the film world with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this one? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he's so attractive that I'm surprised he did not leave for Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during the nude scene. I lent this film to my brother and he called me on the phone telling me that Arthur's nude scene had made him gay. I am totally in favor, of course, because of this film and its admirably designed lessons in tolerance. Why, yesterday again, I burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in his smoking ashes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing about this film. When this Fed-Ex plane took off among the palm trees of Vermont, I cried! Why, I did not even know they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex planes before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's writing school, theater, staging, composition, casting, production, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich, thank you for bringing this creation to the world, we will never be able to repay you enough."
