this film begins with an ordinary burial ... and insists so much on this feeling of ordinary burial that I lost interest five minutes after watching the movie and started skipping scenes. It seems to me that anyone who has made this film is so distressed that he becomes a prisoner of a permanent morbid trance, unable to contemplate anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark children of Southpark, I want a movie that fits me into an interesting story in 10 minutes, I will not sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing, but preparations for funeral. fascinated by the funeral in her last years, perhaps she would have liked this "film".
