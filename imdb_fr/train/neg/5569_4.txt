I tried to like this movie, really. Looking at it, all I can think is: "This guy gives me goose bumps, I would have had a restrictive order". He also calls CODEPENDENCE in uppercase. Was it really the conversation before making the movie? "Let's make a film that connects two people socially deprived of chronic depression and socially incompetent, which reinforces their isolation and encourages them to complain about the seriousness of their lives!" From what I've seen in life is that the ultimate self-pity is the last thing we find appealing to a potential partner. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is distinctly 80 years old; dull and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, very few of them.
