It's such a strange film that you can say it's awful or if you're sitting with friends, it can give you a murderous laugh. Strange comes to mind again and again. Amateur shooting, acted even worse and the instructions, maybe none. The special effects are fun but the music accompanying a baby demon flying will surely be the biggest success. See if you have time to kill. But do not even try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to "the holocaust of porn". As I have not seen it, I can assume, because of the homage, that it is also serious. I should have given it 1/10, but it made me laugh or two, so it gives me a 3. Gore excessive, the only thing that someone has worked on. Stay away if you are naive, more gore than laughter. I wonder if the manufacturers had a laugh while doing it?
