This film is nil and not funny at all. The plot does not even make sense. A scientist who works on the margins of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe a hell ???) and his daughter is sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason, she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skinny outfit (I guess the demons on the other side did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she's gay then, obviously, she is more interested in her new girlfriend, and they come across this witch. spell book (they want to be wizards or something like that ???) and the evil spell ends up being read again. This is how the demon demon arrives on Earth that only the girl from the top of the bikini and the despised lover type can apparently stop. There are scenes of topless without reason and a guy who, according to my boyfriend, is a well-known wrestler, but his role is completely useless, obviously they invented something just to get him in, because then maybe the wrestling fans will watch this useless movie. . I'm sure that topless girls do not hurt either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I thought it might help explain what was happening, but it made things even more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a film that needs camping, but there are many things (like the other dimension and the bookseller) that do not make it confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was only like it was five dollars. I do not recommend watching this movie when it was too stupid, I can not think of any part of the film that is good.
