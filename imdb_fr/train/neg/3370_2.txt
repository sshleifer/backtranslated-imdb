Just an old silent movie. First of all, Stanwyck's son gets stuck in a very stupid way, and then her husband gets caught in a really stupid way. In order to save him, Stanwyck still lacks luck and falls on an escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very stupid way. In the end, her husband is saved and Stanwyck tells us by telling what is the idiotic message of the film. <br /> <br /> I could never understand how a woman as unattractive as Stanwyck has established herself as a leading woman in the Golden Era of Hollywood; this nose is so beautiful ?? If photogenic ?? The film is fortunately short, it lasts a little over an hour. It's as if the director felt that he was doing shit, so he thought it best to keep the shit short.
