What did they think about "Cannes"? One of the most irritating films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter the relevance of its interpretation. If I had to watch her put those boots on again, I think I would have screamed. If the purpose of this film was to show how pathetic Rosetta was, she was covered during the first fifteen minutes of the film and the credits should have been broadcast. But no, we had to see again and again countless redundant scenes. The whole was filled with unattractive and unfriendly characters. They deserved the misery of Rosetta. And to say that I let "Tumbleweeds" pass to see this movie of oversized boredom. It was like watching the grass grow, only it's more exciting.
