This film was nil. It was really a loss of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long and long story, these people are "terrorized" by this pathetic "crazy killer", but completely fail to defend themselves in any way. And it was after taking a raft on a camping trip devoid of equipment and showing up at an already assembled campsite fully stocked with food, clothes and girls' headphones. Moreover, after the disappearance of their boat, they panic of being stuck in the woods, but the boyfriend of the girl appears and seems apparently never able to leave the wood as he had done to reach them. As I said, this movie is nil. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend convince you to watch.
