this film dropped me resolutely. It was a great concept that was ruined by a horrible scenario. The story just did not flow and was at best disjointed. There were so many elements in this story that were not explained or forced to settle down without any real thought. elements such as the love story could have been further developed, and the canons must be better written. all the main character who was growing up needed more information about the training he was getting and less about standing up. Everyone loves a good story of "little guy who overcomes" and that seemed promising, but with the script failures, it should not be. Although some pyrotechnics were used in the final battle sequence, it was dull due to lack of choreography. that makes for an extremely boring watch <br /> <br /> It could have been so good :(
