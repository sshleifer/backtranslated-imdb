I grew up watching the old cartoon Inspector Gadget when I was a kid. It was like getting smart for kids. The talkative breast can not solve any cases and all the work is done by the talking dog, Brain, and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action movie was decent, so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and thought I should have been paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick is not up to the talent of Don Adams as a comedian. His voice was completely wrong. The girl who played Penny was nothing like the Penny cartoon. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with braids. But she does a decent job considering what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy never hid in a strange place or received explosive messages accidentally thrown by Gadget. <br /> <br /> The gadget's mobile was wrong. He never spoke in the series and it went well. Why did they do that? <br /> <br /> Gadget was too smart in this movie. In the show, he was a complete idiot. Here he had a decent middle-of-the-road intellect. It would have worked better if he was a jerk. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the slogan was completely cut up. Borderick says "Wowser". It is and should always be "Wowsers". It seems like nothing with the 's'. I got angry when they showed the previews and they did not have the right sentence. <br /> <br /> The ONLY decent gags took place in the credits. The lack for Claw is in front of a support group to recover henchmen / acolytes. Mr. T, Richard Keil, known as Jaws of Bond, Herve Villacheze, Oddjob, Kato and more are sitting in the audience. That's pretty much the only part I made fun of. <br /> <br /> The other is at the end, where Penny checks for a gadget and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams sounds the dog saying, "The brain is not present at the moment, please leave your name to the sound of the frame." Sad. Of course, it's not funny, it's a nice nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least talked about the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like this, but not those over 13 years old. <br /> <br />
