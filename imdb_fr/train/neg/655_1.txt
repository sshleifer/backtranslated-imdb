I went there with my hopes, with twenty minutes in the film, I could not have been more disappointed. Although thinking it would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe someone would do it right this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night has about the same level of quality as the recent April Fools Day remake, a bad script, bad direction, excessive acting, and general horror. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, it is boring, repetitive and worthy of a dozen rings. We saw everything before and found that it happened a million times better. If you're going to see Prom Night at the theater (wait for the DVD or video a la carte), get ready for the audience to laugh because it's fun. The bursts of laughter in the movie are not supposed to be funny, they are an answer to "exciting" key moments in the movie that are so badly made that you feel like you are watching the latest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be a remake or a parody? The filmmakers missed so much that many of the theatergoers I attended came out half way through the film. In retrospect, I wish I could do it. Not me though, I had to torture myself and persevere in the hope that it would get better. Needless to say, this was not the case. The scenes of "horror" are a joke, not so much because of the acting, but because of the direction, the scenario, the "special effects" and the work of the camera. The film manages to give the impression that they spent a fortune to produce it, but it still came out with a low-budget film. I was half expecting to see dollar store labels on some props and I kept thinking I would spot a porn star somewhere. <br /> <br /> This scary movie well, if this is the future of big budget horror, the kind of horror is doomed.
