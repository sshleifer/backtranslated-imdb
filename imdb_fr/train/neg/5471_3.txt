Typical Troma-Trash, this awesome 1980s movie is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, alongside "The Toxic Avenger", released a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is far superior if you ask me, but this splash of dementia is nevertheless bearable too; Just be sure to leave all your brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town proudly claiming to be the world's capital of toxic chemicals, and they certainly do not lie. The security measures taken in the local nuclear power plant are, to say the least, homogenous (even Homer Simpson has never been so nonchalant) and toxic wastes seep into the nearby high school. The first drunk victim is the stereotypical nerd, who starts squirting green in all his body cavities, but his death would be an accident because he had no less than TWO microwave ovens in his House! Oh humanity! Soon thereafter, however, nuclear leaks also affect the weed planting of the school and the situation really begins to get messy. After smoking a joint at a party, the school's cutest couple creates a monstrous monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage froth. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is a bottom-up horror movie, with silly dialogues that hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. If you like to watch faces melt, get crushed or split in two, it's really a must! Unlike the movie "The Toxic Avenger" mentioned above, this film suffers from very boring and disproportionate moments where nothing really important happens, for example when Chrissy and Warren try to understand what is wrong with their hormones. The raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the acting performances are incredibly amateurish. Continue only if you are passionate about Troma.
