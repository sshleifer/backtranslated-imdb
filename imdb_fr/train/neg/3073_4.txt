At the back of the DVD box, Ellen Page is the co-star in this movie. It does not even appear until two-thirds of the movie is finished, and then it's a minor role. I do not consider it a support role either, but rather a "little" part. The plot also has many unexplained elements. Here are some examples: why does the main character reject his eldest son? Why is his youngest son rushing on the train? He says it's for a "sucker" that explains nothing. Obviously, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a bet on the miller. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think you need to see it.
