Children love dinosaurs. It's a little part of their culture. But they have the land before the time. The original. At least this film had heart. This. This film is simply pathetic. It's not because kids love dinosaurs that you can stick an old story and show it to kids. This film has no plot, the principle is stupid, and it's more based on numbers. Not as seductive as Theodore Rex, but it takes less than a year to become a land before time.
