This film has just been criticized by MST3K and with good reason. First and foremost because it's a "detective" movie starring Joe Don Baker, who, we all know, is as good a cop actor as Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical plot of the camera cops film ugly heads, fights in bars, kidnapped kids, lame police chiefs, lame police chiefs, bad guys acts, revenge / justice, endless henchmen and, of course, bad deeds Do not look at this without an MST3K filter.
