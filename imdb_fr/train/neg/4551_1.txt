I must confess that I do not have a lot of New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy", I always wonder how many kJ are really being traded and how that can help solve the problem of global warming. When energy "is applied", I always wonder how they managed to break the laws of entropy and are still without a Nobel Prize. When people feel how their instinct allows them to navigate seamlessly through the complexities of life, I wonder how they fail to do something as simple as finding the station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them, I find them perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If it was the case with "The prophecy of Celestine", I would not burn this film, but unfortunately, this is not the case. Each actor seems to be bored and unable to grasp what he is supposed to do on the spot. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I tend to do when I talk about quantum physics with someone who really knows what he is talking about and claims to understand. <br /> <br /> the direction is also uninspired. You can expect something more from the guy who did "What dreams can come", but hey, I assumed he was well paid for his job and adopted the attitude of a taxi driver. New York: "It's your money, buddy ..." JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, the villain of all time, seems to be having fun. Not only does he have a job, but he is one of the few actors in this movie to have some shortcomings in this eternally boring and terribly annoying new-age chatter. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar to those of those dinner dates when you discover that your date is actually a horrible trouble that seems to be unable to shut up. At one point, it seems like the words turn into little ping-pong balls that are constantly thrown on your head until you feel pain. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and choose between this film and sticky safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
