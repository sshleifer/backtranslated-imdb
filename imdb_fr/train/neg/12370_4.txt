They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the stupid movie revolves around the map of a graveyard. Not to mention the number of boring plans on the map. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the sweat drops that constantly accumulate on the forehead of our main character. This is of course the way the filmmakers showed us how extremely tense the situation was in the Immortal Hills cemetery. Come on, could not they have shown us a scene of death? We hear a lot about how all the people on the map fall like flies, but we do not see anything. Some how I buried The Living managed to keep my attention, so I was quite generous with the note I gave it but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with cards or sweat, I recommend renting a better movie, such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood.
