What worked so well that French Connection works so well is the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this disaster led by Frankenheimer (who also brought us gems such as Raindeer Games and Island of Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to go to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of French French authorities makes laughing out loud. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier did not leave the city with 65 pounds of pure smack! A market value of 32 million but yes, let's get Doyle to find this guy, it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting game was terrible (with the sole exception of Hackman, who totally exaggerated his role). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
