I had great hope for that since I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it would have more effect. At first I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. It seems that his eyebrows have been reformed for that. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. Gama's thing did not really fit with the original story, I do not think so. I guess the best part of the movie was the end. There was cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not so long but sometimes it's a little boring. I remember some time ago, when Walmart had this really cheap movie to sell and I always wondered why? Now I know. I was hoping to be blown away, but that was not the case.
