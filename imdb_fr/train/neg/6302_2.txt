The UK film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they all be filmed by strangers? This film tears Orwell's hard novel and turns it into a harmless and fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but anyone who reads it can not forget his superb portrayal of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only the cold and hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold and heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be destroyed by a squadron of bombers. But this film repels anything that might disturb in any way, and instead creates a joyous and nostalgic journey in the charming London of the 1930s, in which everything is lit by golden rays of sun, and even the lows -Lambeth bottoms are picturesque and filled with happy sea urchins and prostitutes. Comstock's poems on the violent wind sweeping the streets strewn with garbage seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all is the implacable bonhomie of the script, its old jokes and its stifling dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! The literary history of Britain deserves to be proud of its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We use faint people to make it an innocent, soft-focus tissue that is for people who want to feel like they are "cultivating a culture" while drinking their Horlicks and dozing.
