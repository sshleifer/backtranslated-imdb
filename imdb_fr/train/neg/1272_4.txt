Has anyone noticed every time they are in the car every time the camera takes a new angle, they change their route? As in a scene, it is a single-lane residential street with sidewalks. Then they are on a multi-lane highway with a divider, then a two-lane dual-lane country road. I can understand a small budget but it was just a sloppy movie job. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, then you can enjoy this movie. If, however, you find his job / not funny, I recommend staying away from it.
