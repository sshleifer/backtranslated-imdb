I study Catalan and I am delighted to find El Mar, a film with essentially Catalan dialogues, in my art-house video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not so glad to have seen it. <Yes, as other critics have said, it's well done and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it is well interpreted and convincing. (In most cases, would the Mallorquins die a corpse in anticipation of burial in the middle of the town square, at the sight of the boy's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well .. minor detail . Until then, it looked a bit like a non-magical labyrinth of the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident came of age. Francisca is a nun working in a sanatorium for tuberculosis and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are patients. I know, but hey, there are coincidences. <br /> <br /> The problem, as in so many Spanish films (my apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca), the characters are so dang * weird * . Their motivations, personalities and dialogue are often simply inconsistent. <br /> <br /> In addition, this leads to a horrible miserable excess. Be prepared for a LOT of pain and a LOT of blood. The critic who called it a "potboiler" is quite on the right track. If it had been done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE LOVE PROHIBITED !! GRATED!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY !! TREASON!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is far from sufficient to make credible the personalities and relationships of the characters. To work, it should have had several flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As things stand, it seems like a strange and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If it sounds like something you need to see, enjoy it. I think I'm going with something that does not make me feel like having to take a shower to wash my eyes. <br /> <br /> As for Catalan, it is the dialect Mallorqui, quite different from that of Barcelona. dialect, although I was surprised by the comment that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.
