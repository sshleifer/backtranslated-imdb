I did a lot of reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I have never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and insane that I simply could not get through - even though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and all the Mel Brooks movies that I call "Mel Quotient". In other words, the better the quality of the film, the less visible it is in the film. Think about it - The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great movies and he was barely there. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are bursting with Mel and are rather misshapen (yes, I did not like Space Balls, but that's not the place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Second, aside from cancer, itching in the rectum and mental retardation, I can not think of anything less fun than homelessness. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, guys. The most fun scene (?) From the movie shows Mel doing a whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster !! And how funny is it?
