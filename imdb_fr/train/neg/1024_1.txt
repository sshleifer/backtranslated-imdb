I saw this film at the Toronto festival with quite solid expectations. the film has an excellent distribution and closed at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we had problems when, before the movie, the director told how, when he made an episode of Wakeguy, he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (a director / writer of Wakeguy who starts = blah) ... well, the director / screenwriter of Edison must have some incriminating images of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because I do not see how he (with the other actors of the film) would never agree to be in this disaster situation. <br /> <br /> this movie is absolutely horrendous! it's a mix of all the hard clich√©s of the cops. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like this wiseguy episode mentioned above. it was the best cast directly on video that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of idiotic bad times in Edison ... morgan freeman dances around his apartment for no reason to make rock and roll music ... Justin timberlake receives creative criticism from his beautiful while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage Firebird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> This film is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> EDISON!
