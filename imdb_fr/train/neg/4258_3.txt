I would give this film 5 rather than 3 if it was at least in time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was exactly what one could expect from work, which is not based on the artistic abilities of the directors. but on the idealist or rather, I would rather say the idiotic habits of our government (Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was shooting beautiful movies while he was not honored with the name from Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. Movies like "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after the death of Mr Aimanov, the production of quality films has dropped almost spectacularly in 10 years. Very few films have been produced. However, in the late 1980s, "Assa" was shot. It was a film about the first groups of organized crime in the big country. A year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov was shooting another film with the same actor / singer, V.Tsoy. at that time, he was already a legend of Soviet / Russian rock - the movie called "Igla" (The Needle or something) was completely new, someone called this period a resurrection or a new wave of movies Kazakh. Unfortunately, nowadays, we do not have quality movies. Our directors shoot movies with French and Japanese financial aid. The films are not intended for the public, but for their professional critics. very few of them become commercial assets ... And let's go back to our "nomads". Such films are generally unpopular because of their broad aspects. The same effects were obtained with Nikita Mikhalkov's "Sibirski Cyrilnik" about Russian tsars, also filmed equally with foreign partners, I think they were French or perhaps British. This pleased Nobdy, even in Russian public, he became the main subject of comedians and comedy series like "KVN". In my humble opinion
