This movie is an idiotic thriller action attempt. A tour bus on its way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white hijackers who drive buggies. They lead them into the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. One minute, they are trying to kidnap a rich girl breeders, the next day they look for a collection stamp worth $ 90,000. The dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, please.
