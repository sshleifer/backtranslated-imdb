At first I was happy to know a new Superman movie. I think it will be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of the work of Richard Donner, Lex is still a villain does not do anything else, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> the diabolical plan is the same as that of the first film of Donner much forced. <br /> <br /> the scenario is simple and predictable (everything Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is wrong, it must be Kevin Smith's script and maybe it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope that a sequel without Brian Singer and a new Talent Director will do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> everything will read you later
