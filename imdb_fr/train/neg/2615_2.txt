I do not know why, but for some reason, I think since I was on the Disney binge suite, I decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first film that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil seemed like a hit, but it was just a bombshell. I think the reason these movies do not work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon. It worked better and attracted more children than adults. It was not really amusing because they are adults who try to act like cartoons instead of being human beings. I understand they are trying to make it fun for kids, but it's ridiculous to see how these actors behave. in the movie. And the story of 102 Dalmations is not really good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but things change when it is proven that she now loves animals and that she is a nice human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy diaper, but she buys a shelter for men and suddenly she is loved by all and it looks like she has changed. But when she sees the Dalmatians from her probation officer, she goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she loses it. She is back to take revenge on her puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmation coat she has always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is an extraordinary actress, very underestimated, but she takes for Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie has made the naughty fun a silly school case . Also, as cute as the puppies are, it works more for animation, it sounds stupid, but it's not as credible without the cartoon and their personalities. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmations, that's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was a waste of time, it's exactly the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
