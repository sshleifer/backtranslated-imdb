This film must have been the worst movie I have ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and had it by accident. I thought it was a joke before the movie. It was terrible, I was waiting for it to get scary and it never did. this movie had no real facts about the real killer of Zodiac. The filmmakers obviously did not even bother to look for anything about the murders ... they only liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing that is true to his name . I'm sorry I did not realize it was not the movie earlier. I try to like something in every movie, I do not hate movies ... never ... except this one. If you could give him any star, I would certainly have it. 1 out of 10
