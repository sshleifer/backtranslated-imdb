It must be the worst movie I have ever tried to watch. During the first 15 minutes, nothing allowed me to stay interested in this movie. I was on vacation at the time and I had a lot of time to devote to a movie just for fun. This film was in stock in the apartment we lived in - he must have it in the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you love Adam Sandler, this movie is unlike any other. It started with a bad premise and then just got worse. There is nothing very funny about it. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including movies that were not close to my heart. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
