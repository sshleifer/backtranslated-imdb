All these criticisms are on the spot. Believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, and it's worth it! <br /> <br /> It's not just a waste of time to exploit, but a real, hilarious, atrocious movie. <br /> <br /> Discover the kind of white hairy monster! <br /> <br /> WAKE YOURSELF at Thom Christopher's Spell Weaving Show! IN SHEER A ** DISBELIEF E-CLENCHING! to the broken sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear that some of the people who participate in "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" are not aware of their appearance in a movie! <br /> <br /> DONE! At first, I watched this movie on HTV Wales late at night while suffering from concussion and lack of sleep. I had to find a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really horrible. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more ludicrous than any of John Derek's movies, it's really the Citizen Kane of Trash.
