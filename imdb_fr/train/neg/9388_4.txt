A former security guard, who has become a private security guard, abandons his last hard work and is immediately offered the opportunity to return to his previous occupation. His mission: to hire a mysterious French newcomer to California ... and apparently sought by racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the kind of movie noir, without enough spice or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the scenario. Director and co-writer Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the photo had been changed without his participation) did not give the impression of having high esteem for the films of the 1940s that his "Chandler" was born; his nostalgia is properly wrinkled, but also bitter and somewhat indifferent. The manipulation is curiously, remarkably discreet, and Warren Oates is well presented as this variant of the 70s on the archetype of "private cock", but the film has no clash. Glad to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - although none has to do, and Caron's hot and cold character is infuriating. Bright cinematography of Alan Stensvold, beautiful shot, but it is not in fashion. * 1/2 of ****
