William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor and rather amusing irritation, it has been deemed useful to expand his role and exaggerate it. Exactly like in the original Star Trek series. I guess I'll never understand American humor, which often goes overboard to get the message across. I vote with my feet. I no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast was good. It is unfortunate that Shatner's excessive role also affects James Spader's performance. But the majority shows that society evolves, I suppose. I do not travel the same routes. Franc
