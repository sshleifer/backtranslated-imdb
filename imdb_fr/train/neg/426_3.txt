Do not get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are breathtaking and the content is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I left very angry at what Disney had done. <br /> <br /> The planet Earth of the BBC was all that above and more. It was subtle. There was an overall sense of balance and showed the whole circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's edition of the Earth is not one. They tried to make a film that Americans would talk about. They did it DRAMATICALLY. They put an unparalleled musical score to scare us. They made the predators evil. They made the WALRUSES diabolical. They showed that each encounter was negative. He tried to be suspicious and succeeded, but at the expense of the equilibrium lesson. The film was an hour and a half of negative performance and only about 10 minutes of positive results. <br /> <br /> I am very much in favor of preventing global warnings, but it was above political and environmental waste. <br /> <br /> It's something else, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the quality of the image. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get a complete picture, go buy, rent or borrow the Planet Earth series from the BBC. These are better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
