What do you get when you have bad acting, bad staging, extremely long scenes, terrible lighting, painful editing, and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A ghost story seems to have been shot on betacam, which is fine, but the light needs to complement that medium. In this case, this is not the case. There are some CUs where the person's face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene among psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some scenes were so long that we could easily cut them in half ... but I guess they would not have a feature film. The main character is incredibly flat. This is the LEAD man, so he should have some "hero" elements in his character, but he does not. He moans and is afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting is terrible, I must say that they had a good camera movement. Too bad the lighting does not compliment it. The DVD sleeve is nice, and that's where it ends. Simply terrible.
