The only reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after the broadcast of Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS soap opera. The trailers insist a lot on the fact that the main character had a mutilated arm that made me hope he looked like Victor Caroon of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT who roamed the streets of London. <br /> <br /> No luck, because THE RACING GAME is just a pretty dull thriller with the gadget of having a physically disabled hero who is trying to shed light on investigations of corrupt horse racing. I guess if you're a fan of Dick Francis, you might appreciate it, but by putting it in the context of the late '70s, when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still in production, there was something missing. thing in THE RACING GAME. A trailer presented a car taking another on a motorized road. If it was a trailer for THE SWEENEY, you would see Jack Regan take a car and beat a confession on the slag that made a blag while the professionals took a car and took the terrorists inside. I think that sums up what's wrong with this series
