Here are some of the most glaring issues in this movie: 1) Clichés abound. Seriously, terrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narration jumps over time, which would be nice if it was well done, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Wicked characters who do not develop as much as stay either totally static, or change drastically for no good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big: HORRIBLE ACT. Above almost all people. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best points of the film: 1) The film is extremely beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who would like to be in this movie: a) people who can sit for 90 minutes of guts simply because the thread is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) people who often think alone, "I really like Hollywood clichés and maneuvers, but if I could watch it in Korean ..." There are a lot of good Korean movies, so why waste your time with garbage?
