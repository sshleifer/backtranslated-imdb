This film has not aged well. It may be just the impact and characterization, the play and the clever staging we saw with The Sopranos, but I just watched Honor de Prizzi for the first time, on DVD, alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching with an audience 24 years ago, it must have been quite different, but I must say that I was just dismayed at the end. Not just the violence of it, but the simple idea that it would be a satisfying end. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shock, but it seemed so out of character ... Also, when was it movement? supposed to be settled? The cars all seemed to date back to the 1960s and yet the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many scenes of cityscapes. <br /> <br /> The film has also aged badly The simple idea that a passenger can travel from one ocean to another with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, the audience of the mid-1980s found this film charming and entertaining. In the mid-eighties, meet the children late: only you can live.
