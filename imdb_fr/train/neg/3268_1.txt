It is a real challenge to make a film about a baby eaten by wild dogs and the mother wrongly accused of murder, but who succeeds against all odds. Meryl Streep gives the interpretation of his life, melodramatic, overworked but with this comic genius that makes you laugh even if a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> If the comedies on kids eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea can make you feel uncomfortable looking at it and, yes, it's a strange topic choice for a joke, but really very little of the movie has nothing to do with it as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for his Australian accent and facial contortions. <br /> <br /> Throwing a slam on media prejudices, sensationalism and contempt for truth or ethics gives the film the opportunity to assert the audacity that these things are bad.
