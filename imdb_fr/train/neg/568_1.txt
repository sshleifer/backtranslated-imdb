This "makes its debut" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speechless". I shot it today so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes. Now, I tear the cupboards in search of a length of rope to be able to hang me. Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice, the style "It was fun to make fun of this movie" but this film gives me nothing to work. I know you're not supposed to post spoilers here without warning, but I still go "This movie is bad" There I said it! They should show this film to film students to show them what not to do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or the soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C clamp in my old toolbox. I'll put it on the thumb of my left hand and squeeze it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could simply record over this VHS but I think I will rather burn it in the fireplace. I could wash myself with soap, but I'm afraid I'll never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to the people you hate. -Mike
