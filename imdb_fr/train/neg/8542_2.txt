I'm going through the Chilling Classics 50 film collection and the Mount of Witches (El Monte de las Brujas) is a lot like the 17th movie in the series. <br /> <br /> The film had nothing to do. hold my attention at all. The plot was inconsistent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The game was poor. The characters were unfriendly. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an exasperated woman who is doomed to burn her seemingly grumpy daughter. However, the only link between this scene and the rest of the film is the main character, Mario, who has the most formidable mustache of all time. But that's all. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It's barely visible - what can I say more?
