The Radar Men from the Moon is a typical dish from the 1950s series. The special effects are quite cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously surplus World War II jeeps covered with painted plywood. The game is only blah. It inspires the imagination of children, to whom, I think, it was intended. By today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a considerable amount of archive footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
