Recently, they tried to play this movie late at night with television spots. Do not believe the hype. I was one of the unlucky ones to see this stinker in the theaters. This is, in my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 Worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I have to admit they are all close and terrible! Really, nothing from this movie is funny, disturbing, or anything else that it claims to be, so do not waste your money. The only good thing is giving your worst enemy. I do not lie about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a great candidate for this movie. It's also horrible. If you do not believe me, you deserve to suffer from the misery of looking at it, which I doubt you can finish. Two inches enthusiastic down.
