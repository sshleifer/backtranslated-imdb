Terrible. Just sorry. The scenario is artificial, the acting is painful and the story is dragging. It is, without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and nothing else. It would not be so bad, but she's the director, the screenwriter and the star of the film, and the same goes for self-glorification. I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the two main characters, and the end was not coming too soon. It has two redemption features. The first is that many plans are really beautiful, especially in Paris, and look pretty black and white. Second, whether you're a fan of tango or not, the music is usually great (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you need an involuntary laugh. I'm sure someone likes it. Statistically, it must.
