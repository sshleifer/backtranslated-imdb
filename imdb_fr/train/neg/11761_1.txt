Complete drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical and toxic culture of ten years ago. In this film, pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist sub-texts (the annoying redhead feeding Shaka rice?). Forget the historical reality too. Most Western slaves do not come from West Africa? An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men ?. Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more odious. One can only wonder: how could he have managed in the miniseries? (Promptly impaled most likely). The mini-series was superb and it is unfortunate that DH has got hold of something unique and made it banal. (I tend to think he was involved in creating this fiasco).
