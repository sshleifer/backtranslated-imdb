THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS is powerful enough to create another galaxy, but the final product is questionable enough. The film and its messages are very noble and I think most of them would agree with them. (Good liberal democracy, bad violent fascist regime, good open-mindedness, bad racism, etc.) Unfortunately, we are hit hard by them, and we use as much subtlety as I described them. <br /> <br /> In the end, we have to look at some very noble people, without any fault, arguing with naughty idiots who have no quality that redeems them. It shines with all the suspense of a fight match "orally" poorly orchestrated. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the role of the boss, a man with multiple contradictions. Meryl Streep for his gifted wife and Glenn Close for her sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the movie tends to move and is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS is engaging with far too much sub-intrigue, and the characters appear and come out of the picture as gallery targets. We do not know them, so we do not take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from the book of Isabel Allende) had either lengthened the film, or cut some characters, this film might have worked completely. As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages and a good yawn. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
