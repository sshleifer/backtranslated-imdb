This film had what appeared to be a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it's not a good movie. There are several scenes that are way too long and really useless, like the dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to direct the camera to parts of the woman's body. The acting is bad, but some lines are fun in their horror. What's really strange is that towards the end of the film, it turns into a 5-minute western, and in the end, the twists, which they were many, are meaningless with the rest of the film. It seemed that the director had just added something because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the film to this point. It did not make much sense. The only thing scary was the elderly dancing in the hallway, but that did not even make up for the rest of the mess.
