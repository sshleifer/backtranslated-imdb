In the 1970s, "Seed" focused on convicted serial murderer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but in his electric chair he does not die, even after being electrocuted three times. <br /> <br /> Inspector Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other agents hide this secret by burying Seed alive. . A seed bursts and attacks the people who put it in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a snuff film stretching the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in all aspects of a scenario. And he said that this is based on real events, because if a person survives the electric chair after being electrocuted three times, she will be released. It's an urban legend and it will never happen. Just like Boll's other abominations ("Alone in the Dark", for example), "Seed" is just awful.
