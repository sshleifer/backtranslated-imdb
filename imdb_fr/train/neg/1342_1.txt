This film is the first year effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. Although she suffers from some problems, like any low-budget production, it's a good start for Ms. Beaton and her business. <br /> <br /> The story is not so new that it was made in movies like The Burning and every Friday 13th since part 2. But, the representations are sincere. There are so many big budget movies that the actors do it, it's always nice to see actors who really seek to perfect themselves. <br /> <br /> The story is about the murder (and the possible return) of a disfigured comrade. Others are sworn in secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one by a horrible stalker known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You must watch. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or a number of arrogant critics, you probably should not mind. But if your tastes go more to Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people perfecting their skills, then take a look at "The Bagman".
