I saw this on TV the other night ?? or rather I spent time on another channel to watch infomercials when I could not bear to watch them. It was bad. Really, really bad. It's not "so bad that it's good", but simply. How was it funded? Who thought it was a good idea? One of my friend actors auditioned and was told that he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what they meant was "save yourself and run away from that smelly stack of @ # $% ". I bet the rest of the cast had the opportunity. To be honest, the acting was hard to judge because of the scary false American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was clumsy and on stilts. The dialogue was insane. By far the saddest was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a seedy boat and on film, it does not rub well. Instead of trying in vain to give the impression that it was a new crew liner with tin pieces wrapped around rusty soundings, I beg you, they could have changed the scenario to explain or even celebrate thinness. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Do not watch this movie, not even as a joke.
