It is difficult to criticize this film because I do not like the story itself and no good action could have saved it. Think "Arizona Raising" with a medium drag. The acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly has exceeded expectations (but not enough to make this film a good movie camp) as usual, somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic employee of the DMV. The other members of the cast are constantly frowning, dismayed at the stress of their parts or the stress of this futile exercise. A real film degrading a few hours. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I went out, sorry.
