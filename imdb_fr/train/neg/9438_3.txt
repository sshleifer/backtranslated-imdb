Have you ever watched a movie that lost the plot? It did not even really have one to start with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painfully tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house without any sense of threat or even apprehension created even during the seemingly constant thunderstorms (which are strangely never heard in the house - a large double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a city but is a few hours walk away (?) Or the third girl who is no help to the plot, unless to provide a bloody murder surprisingly fast, at the moment when the boredom becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning that suggests a series of more than 20 murders throughout the region, although it is obvious that the killer never ventures far from home? Or the weird ritual of salt and pepper that pretty much sums up most films that lack direction. <br /> <br /> Add a lead actress who can not play but who is at least willing to do things completely out of place. naked shower scenes and this video is really nasty, but not in the way you hope. <br /> <br /> Given an audience simply for being banned in the United Kingdom in the 1980s (mainly because of a surprisingly long murderous killing outcome) it offers nothing but value out of curiosity - and a classic "stupid" murder (do not worry, it's telegraphed at least ten minutes before.) upward slope they obviously struggle. Halfway, they see at the top a figure dressed in black and brandishing a large fake. What are they doing? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not, they fight to the top and keep themselves pleasantly comfortable and standing in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie, as they say.
