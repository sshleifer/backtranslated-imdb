As a young pastor, I heard good things about this film. Then I watched it. The acting game was not the best. It is forgivable. This is the message that does not tell us: give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll do better, catch incredible, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes and even play in the playoffs. All because Jesus magically transforms horrible weaker-sized infants into All-American athletes. I laughed loudly when a coach quoted Bible passages to explain to the kicker why he was missing goals. But wait, that's not all. You will get a brand new truck, an increase of $ 6,000, and the fight that you and your wife against infertility will abruptly end the pregnancy - twice. THEN you will win the state title, because God is helping a weak player to score the winning goal by 12 yards more than he has ever hit before - and in the wind, not less - all because "God wanted it. " Then you will win the state championship next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus, it would make all their hearts. <br /> <br /> Here's what I learned from the film: God can do anything he wants to do - and everything is done to make our life better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps him win games. What Bible is this story based on? I bet Saint Stephen would have liked to know the keys to such a safe life before being stoned. Someone should have done this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. That would have saved them a lot of problems.
