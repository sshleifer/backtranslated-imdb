Boy this movie had deceived me. Honestly, I thought it would be a campy horror movie with absolutely no humor, boy, I had the cold shoulder this time. This movie was, and I'm honest, damn good. It was not scary at all but the devious campiness and humor really crazy this interesting movie. Some of the horrible scenes of cliché shooting and killing were so painful to watch that I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to a certain extent, I appreciated it. The killings are all vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The angles of the POV camera were impressive. <br /> <br /> The film is about a slimy killer who dies in a car accident with a chemical truck while being transported to jail. It is then resurrected in the same chemical with spliced ​​snow in the mixture. These are the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He takes his revenge, as a snowman, on the policeman who found him guilty. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, except for Christopher Allport, that it was funny. I will say that I am also quite disappointed that this film is not a horror, but in reality a dark sitcom. They had a nice story with a good plot, but it was not executed properly. Overall, I like the movie at first, but it's very annoying now. But this movie is much better and darker than the rest.
