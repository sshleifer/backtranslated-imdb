I am a big fan of horror / splash, I even like horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like gore. The more we are crazy, as long as it knocks. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of other users on the site, I was convinced that this film would be a gem. But, to my disappointment, this movie turned out to be one of the most useless movies I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogues stupid, the useless plot, the useless special effects the editing was probably done by a person who died two years ago. Usually, I find that all these features make an excellent horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I exchanged 11 EUR for this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy unnecessary gore (for example, "violent" movies), avoid it at all costs!
