IT MUST BE FIRST SAID THAT READING THE MANGA, MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON DIFFERENCES. <br /> <br /> This anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the high quality comedy and action of manga and OVA. What she left behind was just an envelope of what she could have been. Many characters lacked the depth that we see in the manga. Alucard is not the friendly character who secretly wishes death. Walter's story lacks treason. And the nasty Nazis who are plotting to engulf the world at war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides Incognito, the villain of Gary Stu, who is defeated against what seems to be quite haphazard. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga, but that it does such a mediocre job. .
