Sometimes a movie is so horrible that it has a destructive effect on your morale. You are really starting to wonder what it means for our society that the standard is so terribly low. Can they honestly expect us to support so many clich√©s and still have fun? <br /> <br /> Of course, he remains a Hollywood pillar to make GUN the main character, the plot and the source of all conflict and resolution in the movies. The character needs a gun. Gets a gun. I can not do that because he has a gun. Put his weapon first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do !? He has a gun! He circulates it, acting more wicked than real human beings. He pushes him in someone's face for 90 minutes shouting questions. The conclusion of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It's a real challenge to make a formula as tired and worn as ever; a movie must be very intelligent and well executed. This one is neither one nor the other. He has no life or personality, and he will suck up these components of YOU. you will feel WORSE to live in the time and space you do. Really, who needs this !? So yes, I'll say it: I think it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen. Anyone who has been involved in the making of this deadly mediocre soul basket should be publicly embarrassed for the bad service they have rendered us.
