Sometimes I do not know ... you try to be charitable towards all quality B to Z movies, but from time to time, a particular movie simply tests your patience until you want to hit all the participants . "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is a film of this kind. You can not look at this without thinking that it really should have been an episode of "Night Gallery", and none of the best, either. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is stung by a bat and therefore starts to turn into a Were-Bat that drinks human blood. (In fact, one would think that if he became a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes by a bucket of gallons, but as this is a cheap and noisy horror movie, the word is blood.) makes grand-mal seizures in no time and episodes of blackout almost every night, his friend and colleague, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists he just has an "allergic reaction" "to rabies vaccines. Meanwhile, the world's most odious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doctor of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several girls in the region (and a wino). At the same time, the doctor's wife decides that the refusal is a river in Egypt. He protects and distracts him. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that the acting is bad - you can say that the actors make professional-level choices and try to give juice and life to the screenplay, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (OK, it's pretty bad, but it's bad, professionally, in wood and cliché) It's just that all about the acting, the way the scenes are rhythmic, the costumes, the dialogue, the scenario and the scenario in general makes you angry and makes you want to, well, slap everyone. <br /> <br /> I think the film had an outside chance of becoming a disturbing and troubling little cult favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor, with a chair until Pataki agrees to ACT, not just channeling Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a more logical scenario for the script "Bat Bites Human, which then turns into bats". <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who plays the role of the doctor to find a little more physically credible stage work for his "episodes", instead of resorting to the "L" page. Man has a seizure "of Little Guestbook of Acting mannerisms clichés. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to rework all the character of "woman", to make it both smarter, less acute and more attentive. <br /> <br /> I would never watch this film again voluntarily, without the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a stupid, humorous or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", though.
