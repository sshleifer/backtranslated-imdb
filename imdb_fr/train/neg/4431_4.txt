This dramatic comedy garnered some amazingly remarkable reviews when it was released in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times film section and watching a 2-page "Chapter Two" ad filled with brilliant legends such as Au- goodbye, girl! "and" Neil Simon does it again! "What does Neil Simon do? He adopts an autobiographical situation (remarries too soon after the death of a beloved husband) and makes him rusty, unpleasant and - worse still - not very funny James Caan plays Neil - uh ... it's George - a writer who seems unable to find his life after losing his wife Entering the animated spirit, Marsha Mason (the real life of Mrs. Simon ... who will soon be the old Mrs. Simon) who tries to love George despite his mood and general melancholy Mason is very attractive here and could have saved the day if there was not indifference of Caan (not to mention a secondary plot about Va Harper, a terribly thin blonde, who suddenly stops the procedure). I enjoyed the explosion of Mason at the end ("I'm beautiful, I'm NIGHT for me!"), But I did not see a happy ending for these two people ... and the time ' has given reason. ** from ****
