It does not matter that Superman's comics are incredibly na√Øve and that their target is ten years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, a question for you, dear readers, how many of you really think that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? Anybody? Exactly what I thought. No spoilers here. So let's tackle some major issues right now. <br /> <br /> First, this film has a commercial appearance (the scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just the scene that looks as it should) . Imagine the Superman ad, two and a half hours. Let's be serious it's not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You really think this movie is way too long. And the special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is ridiculous. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in comics, at the movies, it just looks stupid. And it's like that in this case. Of course, the dialogues are a shame. I can not believe someone is taking money to write them. How many times will we be fed with bad speeches? How many times will the laws of physics be violated? (Jesus, it's not just the question of Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials with which he deals.) How many times will Lois be deceived by Kent? How often do Hollywood producers go looking for a story in a trash comic book? Since it's hard to make a good story, why have a weak story for a beginner? It does not work. Guys, take a handle. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I have the impression that WGA is on strike permanently. Without wanting to offend you. I do not question the lame money that these people are paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case, there is no quality at all. (At this point, you may wonder: is it so bad? Yes, that's right.) Third, the acting is weak, which is a surprise since Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) is the director . Kevin Spacey has fun, but he's the only one. The public is not in the mood to joke. The thing is that the cartoon hero can be developed in the real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, a certain depth. In this case, nobody has done this work and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, all the effort of the creators makes this film a travesty. The second unit is so bad that it gets attention because there is nothing interesting on the screen anyway. The more they try (if they try), the more funny it becomes (but it's not funny that you can expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This film, ladies and gentlemen, is camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money too. Stay at home, read a book.
