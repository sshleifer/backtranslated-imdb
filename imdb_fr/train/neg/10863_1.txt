LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but it really made us bored .......................... . ............ <br /> <br /> This movie is really wasting your time and money. I went with my friend to this movie the first day of his release and I was both bored in the movie theater ...................... .... ............................ <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this film. I think SANJAY-DUTT has reduced the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> Character of the film is also not well defined as the previous one. This film shows the result of the SUR-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confusing .. ... ............. <br /> <br /> A VERY GREAT DECEPTION
