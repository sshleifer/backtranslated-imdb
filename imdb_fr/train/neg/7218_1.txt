There is a scene near the beginning after a shooting where horses run. If anything red catches your eye, it's because a white van is parked behind a bush at the edge of the trail. I thought I saw badly but that's it. A white pickup truck in a western. Did not they catch him? Oh well, and I paid a heavy price for the rental. This will make you want to catch your friends and have them all put in $ 10,000 and make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the acting was generally OK but could not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of the shoot. There is a sheriff door that looks like a door today with the particular trim. I told him to watch this film and to put Cabin Boy in second place in the worst of all times.
