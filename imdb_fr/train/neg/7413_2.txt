I just watched, I can not say I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts pretty well, the visual and atmosphere give a terrifying effect as this type of movie should do. But everything ends when the first lordi monster appears. Not only do you recognize them in the lordi group, but they are seriously misplaced in the movie. The cursed monsters with leather jackets and piercings date back so much to the 80s. <br /> <br /> As for the scenario, it starts with similar horror movies, people trapped in a hell. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer sees lines on possible reasons, but these never meet and never end up becoming a mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an intriguing start and positive effects, I thought someone would have taken better care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary (except that they are not). <br /> <br /> The film is therefore credible for the images, I guess the money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to scare their nicknames of monsters on stage.
