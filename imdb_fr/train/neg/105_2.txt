There are tons of pretty women in this movie. But alas, this film is without nudity. Grrrrrrrrrr Hit one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. Why then do the main characters lead a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, do you like it? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And that's the most hideous effect I've ever seen. I do not know if anyone botched the work on it, but there was no 3D, only fuzzy pictures. I did not have the same problem with the other 3D films of this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, the 3D in those also was nil, but with them, I could see a semblance of 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And whoever the woman was the one who played the girl of the lady who eats the ears, yum! I would like to see more of her. In the movies too. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
