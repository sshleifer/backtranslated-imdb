Pyramid Indices of $ 25,000: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slide. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: More Fun and Exciting Movies than Snakes on Plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with this definition, one would have to include the relatively heartbreaking factor of Ted and Elaine's trip by plane! as superior to snakes in laughter and chills. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all the funny and intentional snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to the unpublished cast of JLo-Cube-O. Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same movie, you had Jon Voight who made the cinematic turning of all time. His last scene alone is all that SOAP has tried and failed as a movie "so ridiculous that it's fun". <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on Plane is the definitive proof that execs and studio fans make the worst possible collaborators. Every big stage had been so discussed and dissected last year, it only remained to amuse the opening night, it was the amount of fanboy sweat that had to be blotted out at my theater. I heard more forced laughs here than during the studio recording of "From Jim".
