This series was the response of CBS networks to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90-minute western, just like the ABC program. Even if it was an answer, he could not afford to survive the second season. <br /> <br /> The problem became a reality that was lost during this show. For example, in one episode, Johnny gets stung by a stick. Surprisingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. At the same time, stories about it were not as strong as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show I do not want a DVD, and that I sincerely hope never see out. Remember that since CBS missed a lot, they reused many familiar settings. CBS is one of the last Western series produced by CBS, as Westerns were not really popular in the 1970s.
