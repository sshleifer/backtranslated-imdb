THIS IS NOT A FILM OF CHILDREN !!! <br /> <br /> This film is like a "bad trip to the acid" for children under 5 years old. For a month, my 4-year-old son would ask me, "Why was this rabbit bleeding from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (And it was not the worst) We stopped him about an hour and a half but the damage was done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot all that miserable thing. Whoever has decided that this film should be sold to children should be high on charges. ... (Go ahead, censor me, my conscience is clear.)
