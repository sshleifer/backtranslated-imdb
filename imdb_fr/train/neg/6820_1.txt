This foolish and implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-hitting police inspector delivers almost audible replies confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had given up the sparkling star of A. Martinez for the benefit of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a nameless street pirate can save such a scathing film is no less likely than a murderer who commits murder by throwing stones into a career for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is brief. his promise is immense. Maybe this dark spy will give us more time in front of the screens if there is a sequel to this misguided movie.
