I saw this trailer and told myself that my god was this movie for real, who would like to see this movie and, at the same time, I thought it, my girlfriend turned to me and told me says "we have to go see this movie". ..enough said I saw it about 5 minutes and I tried to put a brave face and enjoy the cheap frights, but there was not even one of those. It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The director has no influence. The same plans were used again and again. He did not arouse suspense; the actors were probably just warned not to scream. I'd love to see the script because the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying, girly chuckles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... well, there was none. Basically, I know we are going to terrorize a group of high school students at their prom with a serial killer stalkers, it's great! hmmm The acting game was what you'd expect in a hopeless Australian soap opera, that main character of mother Blondie god she annoyed me. her longest sentence was half-sentence, and each time she was in front of the camera, she was simply drawing another coarse facial expression. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to me if you have any taste in the movies, do not go to see If you like me and you have no choice, I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle into an ipod or magazine. I can not believe this movie was done!
