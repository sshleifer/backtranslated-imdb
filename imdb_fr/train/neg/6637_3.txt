They should have named this film ... blonde women who had to color their roots. Also the main character, Geeze, the sweaters too tight. The laughter I thought the guy did a good job. I hope we will find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week. The dart throwing. I had to laugh too. We still have 3 other recorders to watch, maybe we'll be lucky. Oh yes, I quickly understood the guy and I chose him well when he picked up the flowers and left with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were going to the cemetery. And how stupid did the two girls follow them by spying on them? Creepy.
