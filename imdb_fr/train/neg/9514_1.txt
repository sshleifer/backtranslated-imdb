Please, spare me those movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Add to that an empty scenario with an intense desire to be a brother of Farrelly or Coen, as well as the life of a group OTHER OTHER group of so-called young high school students playing their angst of the Dawson Creek brand with a soundtrack GenXYZ tries to make the movie "cool" and that we have an intensely painful satire. <br /> <br /> This is not even diluted 'Ferris Bueller' ... I would rather watch a change of fire. <br /> <br /> There is only one scene that can be worth the price of admission: when Betty Masked's daughters meet a friend of Richard Nixon Masked. It's a surreal moment. Even without price. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, I would prefer to have a toothache. At least I can apply benzocaine (TM) to stop the pain.
