If you enjoy the revival of Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The film hardly deserves to be mentioned alongside famous works such as Ringu, The Story of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even as good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and a decidedly non-Western look at what's scary. Gawi is chained with the remains of limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror ugly over the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> bad fit. One aesthetic is doomed to smother the other; guess which one? Having no story to tell, the filmmakers plunder Ringu for a diabolical childish plot, but the situation is hopeless. Cliches, crappy characters, insane intrigues, a dull ghost, ho hou.
