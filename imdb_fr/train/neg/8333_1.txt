It's by far the worst film I've seen in my life. The acting is mediocre and the scenario is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like flagship boats or any other vessel is unimportant. As for the special effects, the film does not have any. The entire crew was probably on the boat at rough water rather than in the studio and when some men are "stabbed" (if you can even say it's like that), their reactions are totally unreal. Guns are quieter than a mute. The way this film could have two prizes poses serious questions to the human state of mind. That is just about everything. This review is probably more fun to read than the movie to watch. If anyone plans to look at it or buy it, I would seriously advise against it for obvious reasons. I said he understands a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a gun is shot, it's a conspiracy. I guess it's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
