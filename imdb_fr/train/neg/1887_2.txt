Earlier in the day, I wondered why so many people were complaining about modern movies, in which I met a curious statement: "The development of characters in newer movies is just not as good. neither as interesting as he was. " Depending on the film or films in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plot-based Hollywood trash, such as War Of The Worlds, but in the case of excessive and uninteresting attempts social commentary and fierce struggle to put "art" in the cinema, it is movies like Dog Days that are to blame. <br /> <br /> I normally have a great tolerance for films, as deaf as they are crazy (ranging from good, long as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those that I have deemed painful to pass to side of an Alpha Dog and a Wild Wild West). I close this film for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes longer than I should have. The characters did not interest me at all and I found nothing substantial except a thin veil of vague pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the ruins of society, this film falls too easily into self-indulgence, banal and exploitation in a very sincere sense. Certainly, I've seen a lot of disturbing films on the same subject, but there are so many better movies about depressing and pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Tales, Irreversible) that actually contain characters from a great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days was nothing more than a society disgust for an eighth student, choosing to ignore any real intelligence about how people really are, and choosing instead to be a dull, dreadful and hopelessly non-original attempt of a work of art. It's not a characterization of the unknown or an intelligent observation in the bottom of society, it's boring and nothing deserves to worry about.
