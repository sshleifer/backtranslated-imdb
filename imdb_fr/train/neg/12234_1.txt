I think it was useless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie but it's ridiculous to do a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin like Thomas J.) dies. The story was over after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to tell the story. It was insane!
