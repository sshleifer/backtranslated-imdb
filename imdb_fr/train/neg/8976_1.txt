The first point that gets attention in "For Ever Mozart" is the lack of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple since there is no story, scenario, plot or anything that could recall the minimal structure of a film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most underrated and pretentious directors in the film industry, and this useless shit is one of his most hermetic films. I do not think that he himself understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who are lucid enough to justify or explain this messy film, and it is amusing to read their critics. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
