I really miss every second of the time I lost watching this movie. Unfortunately, I still have trouble turning off a movie once I start watching it. Especially when it comes to a classic or what people call a classic. I think it's one of those movies that every moviegoer should have looked at least once, that's why I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall, both as a couple and as actors, but this film was a big fraud in my opinion. Not really a good plot, nor a spy movie nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of these two genres. The only thing that caused tension was that it was uncertain that "Bogey" and Bacall would stay together at the end or separate from each other. I think that "having and having" is very overestimated and that Bogart was in many of the best movies in the 1940s.
