We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could be our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable and the acting is disastrous. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving substandard performance. The plot is shameful and at times we were so bored that we wondered what was going on. He tries to be macabre in places but it's just laughable. <br /> <br /> It's terrible
