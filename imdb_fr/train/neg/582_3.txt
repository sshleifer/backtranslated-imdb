A brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and understanding of human nature, especially the nature of addiction, still resonating today. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and doing everything, which made the viewer quite nauseous. The reason the director did not put an end to all this is beyond me, but he was perhaps too busy, and somehow, by failure, to draw good performances from these usually excellent actors but poorly placed. In the end, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or rereading) the book.
