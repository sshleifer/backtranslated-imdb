This is one of those films that is more interesting to watch from an academic point of view than from an entertainment point of view. I make my ratings based on what I liked or enjoyed the movie, so I give it a 4. If I had to classify it as an academic film, it would get a 10. <br /> It is shot in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-mute film with elements of sound effect and reality. It is supposed to convey a rambling memory and a fragmentation of the mind, which is interesting in this respect. <br /> <br /> However, the film contains many disgusting elements that did not seem entertaining to me. They are mainly just disturbing. It also contains some very interesting pictures and interesting concepts, but some character relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film will please you either it is not right. For me, it was interesting from an academic point of view, but it was not a good watch and I probably will not come back for a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you look. for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
