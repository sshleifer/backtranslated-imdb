I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, maybe I could just go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2, not a 1, is that the story has some innovative story elements, even if it never gets to the level of interest. This film has all the assets to be a movie made for the market of take-out cinemas - ultra-low budget, amateur acting game and a liberal dose of sex (for a film of the early 60s). In fact, I'm wondering if the only reason the film was shot was to make quick money AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras. The film is about a Wacko doctor who wants to graft his girlfriend's sliced ​​head on the body of an unsuspecting giver. Most potential donors are strippers or a dummy - whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes. However, they are too much for the film to be worth watching and the film is not awful enough to deserve to be watched by bad moviegoers.
