This film reminded me of those lame "erotic thrillers" that I was watching late and watching Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would call this film softer because there is simply no hump or simulated grinder. There is, however, a ton of nudity - the opening scene is in a striptease club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least a stunt), then an inexplicable lesbian dance scene of 10 minutes in the middle of the film and a nude A werewolf that looks like a Munster costume. The 13-year-old boys rejoice. <br /> <br /> Other than that, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The plans resemble the FMV of the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too hard to explain and, despite the poor quality of the combination, is shown far too many times. <br /> <br /> Intrigue and acting do not make sense. There are some weird stories about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - the Black Wolf is the latter but, as far as I can tell, hybrids do the same thing as all werewolves: having human air, change to a wolf and kill people. The Black Wolf tries to find a partner, but curiously, he can not find the partner but can sniff out all the people he touches. Once again, this skill proves to be of little use, because the Black Wolf ends up killing several people that his target has never touched, or even met, or even seen as I can say. The mate does not know he's a werewolf and he's fighting the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> One would think that it would be difficult to spoil a simple monster movie, but it's true. . You want a low-end werewolf quality, go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T & A is your movie.
