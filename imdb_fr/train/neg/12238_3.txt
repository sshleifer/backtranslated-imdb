A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's glowing nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this movie - a bit like The Force in the Star Wars movies did not need the explanation of "Medicines in the blood". But mainly, the film left me cold because of Winterbolt's too complicated plot to destroy Santa Claus. He has the power to make suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things so deviously? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family ... The comic intrigues of Pinky and the Brain and Dr. Doofenshmirtz's "Phineas and Ferb" This sounds simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt, which should take us a little seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly strange (and funny) moment when a character throws both his weapons at the villain, like boomerangs. . I understand that if they do not want weapons to be filmed in a family film, but why then have guns in the first place?
