This is a typical example of filmmakers and technically highly skilled commercials trying to make their first feature film. On the one hand, the images, the camera, the lighting, the computer graphics and even the sound are very polite and have a truly "expensive" aspect. Even the actors show some potential - to the point where even the best actors could not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not a bad plot, but hardly a plot. <So 50% of the dialogue is "What was it?", "What was it?" and "What was that?" In none of the cases do any of the characters or the public receive the slightest hint of response. In most other dialogues, there is the feeling that there has never been a dialogue book and that the actors had to improvise freely on a plot that had never been explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason Skye Bennet's performance could be so good is that her autistic girl character did not allow her to give her those tragically awful lines of dialogue with which the others actors had to compose. In this way, she was able to show her acting talent to which the rest of the cast could not even approach. I mean there is not a single actor in the world who can compose such a dialogue: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is it real, huh? Emily: Stop that. Ben: Mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone needs to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not by you or by anyone. Emily: Not by you either. Ben: No <br /> <br /> I have goose bumps. But not for horror, not for the horrible attempt. At times, I was ashamed that the actors added that to their vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
