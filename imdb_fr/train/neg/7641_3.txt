This is one of those films that tries to be moody and tense and eventually stumbles. After seeing him at a queer film festival, I was intrigued by the writing of the film "The young trio of a college went wrong". However, I ended up being quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to criticize a "real story" because there is not much to do about the plot - but I found it disjointed, melodramatic and totally depressing. It is dark and almost sinister, painting a scary zest of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close-ups. It simply does not work - some scenes are so ridiculous that instead of scare me, my audience suppresses sneers and rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting principle, but it just goes into a black, miserable spiral.
