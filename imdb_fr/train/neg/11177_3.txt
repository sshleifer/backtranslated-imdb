In what appeared to be the longest of the last 35 hours I've had in a long time, Al Pacino provides a precise performance to be sure. Not his usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Someone miserable stumble while forgetting his appointments and we realize that Hollywood social life has emptied all his energy. But in this movie, we needed someone to love. And for some reason, all the characters in the photo said "I do not know why I love you, Eli" to the character of Al Pacino and I could not even appreciate it. <br /> <br /> All other actors have played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn have done nothing to change their established personality on television or in previous films. And Kim Basinger has not even been in the film long enough to offer a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The film's story has not picked up speed. Most scenes never advance the story, but merely gather information about characters that then materialize into an anti-climax. This had potential, except for their reluctance to take advantage of the story. <br /> <br /> What is the film for? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe "Once Hollywood got you, you can not go out anymore." Yes indeed! And that's why so many people get fired in Hollywood.
