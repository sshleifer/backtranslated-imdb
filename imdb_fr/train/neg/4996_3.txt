I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, it has become corny, or should I say, "just stupid". This is just another example of obsolete humor. It may have been funny in 1940, but not now .... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I loved him particularly once he had begun to change his youthful appearance and catchy voice in Busby Berkeley's musicals and become more mature than him. The cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who was just shouting all the time. He was brutal to hear and badly hurt the movie.
