Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film particularly irritating. Maybe because I'm from another era and from another country, but I found Crosby's continued references to Good Old USA pleasing at first, mundane after a while, then boring. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that the English could not do anything good and / or did not need this brave American visitor, so clever, to show them the way. It's a story of "fish out of the water", but unlike most movies of this genre, this time it's the "fish" that has the upper hand. To be fair with the film and myself, I've watched it a few times, spaced a few years apart, and I have the same feeling every time. <br /> <br /> (I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that too provoked the same reaction in me and, to my surprise, even my wife - which is really worth to be American - found that the "face to face" attitude of the American Crosby was irritating, Roosevelt, as she said.) <br /> <br /> As for the principle of film, it is quite unique for its day and the secondary distribution is of course very good. The scenery and music are equally good, as are the beautiful costumes - although I agree with a previous comment, William Bendix's wig looks horrible (photo Moe des Trois Stooges). <br /> <br /> All in all for me, it would be a much nicer picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby, but as it is in almost every shot, it's pretty hard to miss out on that movie.
