So, this guy named George is home alone on his birthday when two women show up. George's wife is in a hospital and takes care of her son. So when the woman is away, George goes to the bubble bath and makes love with both girls. It's not a very good scene because it really does not show anything. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at home. They make him a good breakfast but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and he tries to drop them but when he comes home, the girls are always at home. The girls are tired of old George and do not want to cook for them anymore. They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their crazy little game. I liked the girls doing what they wanted and searching George's house. George was not really good for both of his guests. When George said he was a married man, he really did not seem to want it. George looked like Tom Tucker in Family Guy. I was for both girls all the time.
