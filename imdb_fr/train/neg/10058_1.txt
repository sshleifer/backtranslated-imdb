I was fascinated by the gravity of this film. Was the viewer supposed to learn something or think about anything here? What was going on with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed by the pictures of the motel? Is it important that there are garbage bags on the roof across the street from a hotel? Why does the narrator make fun of the people he is interviewing (it is so obvious that he has removed the really informative parts of his interviews to make fun of him). The best part of the movie was the film teacher's interview that told us how bad this movie would be before it was finished. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised. I believe that the creator struggles to become an intellectual or tries to impress the intellectual community.
