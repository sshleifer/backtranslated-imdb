As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse's books, I find this series to be a gross representation. Vampire Bill is not very pretty and looks much older than what is described in the book. I found that they have already rendered wonderfully colorful characters very vulgar and of course. One of the things I liked about the books is that despite all the bullshit she goes through, Sookie is still a lady and yet, in the TV show, she does not seem like that at all. In addition, prejudices displayed in television series are not as prevalent in books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books but I expected at least that their sensation would be used for the series.
