Why do people who do not know what a time in the past feels like trying to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the civil war and landing on the Apollo moon by the sinking of the Titanic. You get a film as realistic as this television soap opera entirely populated with unsustainable garbage. Is that what children are doing when they are too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and have failed in school? "I'm going to show these old villains, I'm going to release my own movie and prove that you do not need to know the subject on your subject to make more money!" Yes, we already know it. The only thing this movie looked for me was to give me a glimpse of the thinking of the underprivileged classes. The next time I see a slut in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I'm running the other way. It is child abuse to let worthless parents raise their children. It is abusive on the part of the public to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding in a film as if it meant ipso facto that the film describes 1969.
