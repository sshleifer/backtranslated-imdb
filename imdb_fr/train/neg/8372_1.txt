I can categorically and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet, it's the worst film (supposedly child) I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren to see him and even they had a hard time smiling for 90 minutes. I'm going back for another day, but they were as bland as the movie. They should pay you to watch it, not you pay them. It's really really horrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be prosecuted for using money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Aplogise for my spelling mistakes, but I am so upset that the time I spent with my grandchildren was ruined.
