Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, no thought, nothing else when I looked at this one. It started well and was quite fun, so why a bad review. In the end, the film lost its credibility. The scenario was not at all cheesy, the action was not too special but overall good, playing was OK, so more than enough to meet my needs. But all were ruined because extreme events occurred, and it left me with a bad feeling. They should have made a little more effort to make everything credible and get a 7 in the category "no thinking, nothing but actions". So, in conclusion, if you know you're going to get upset, there are things that seem completely illogical: do not look! otherwise I would say go for it ...
