Once upon a time there were villains who filmed a guy who was allegedly killed in space, supposedly to go to Saturn, but who was actually only shooting a short film of solar lights, then bleeding from his nose, and before you know it, he's lying in a hospital bandaged from head to toe, then an overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy, who is supposed to melt in all directions but does not seems to never lose mass, then NASA, or at least one guy from NASA, gets angry about it and calls another guy to chase him, but the guy they sent to chase the fondant guy has to go back to the home and take a soup first, and his strange-shaped wife forgot the crackers, so he can not have any, and then he has to go out and get the fondant guy with a Geiger counter, and it does not really work, so he's just following the track of dead corpses eaten, and then there is something about a sheriff, and two ugly old people in a lemon grove, and a woman with a meat cleaver, a kind of industrial factory with security guards. at the easy trigger, and as I can not tell you how the movies end, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with a dumb guy named Burr DeBenning, and if He does not There is no justice in the world. All people related to this film died of a hideous and violent death without being able to make more films. The world has lived HAPPILY NEVER AFTER THE END!
