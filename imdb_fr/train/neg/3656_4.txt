I must confess that I am a fool for Samurai's films since I remember well. I used to look rather indiscriminately, whether it was "elitist" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody variation of comics such as Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked American / Japanese "Crossovers" like the Bushido Blade. And of course, all that contains Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I practically watched every samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I saw Kabuto for the first time in video, although Samurai movies can be boring. At first, I hoped that Mayeda would reach Europe and the clashes that would result, but when he arrived in Spain, I did not really care about the film anymore. <br /> <br /> It would not do justice to the movie to call it "bad". Technically, it's a straightforward entry into the genre. But there is simply never enough calm. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as a director and actor and has only a fraction of the aforementioned Japanese actors' charisma. And speaking of Kane, the son of Sho Kosugis, who appears in almost all of Sho Kosugi's films as a son of Shos: he inherited the quasi-inexistence of his acting skills. The absence of blood and blood that was until then a trademark of all Samurai movies adds to the negative points. It was obviously intended for a younger American / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's say this is a mediocre film for the average fan of story-action-adventure, but boring for hardcore samurai fans. Fans of the genre "Samurai meets ??" - should instead go see Red Sun (1971), starring Charles Bronson as a cowboy who must team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to recover a samurai sword from the villain Alan Delon. That's pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> Thus, even if the film only lasts 100 minutes, it seems to be a much longer film. <br /> <br /> The reason I awarded him an honorable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the synchronized German version . In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I must admit that his 'Engrish' is sometimes funny but becomes tedious after about 30 minutes.
