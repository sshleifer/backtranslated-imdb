This film was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama of the war of independence. There were memories of "Dances With Wolves" for great grasslands, Indians, military fights and "Barry Lyndon" for British moods & candles ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is frightful: the continuity of the story is lacking (cuts with "5 months later" "3 years later") and the romance is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe: America is a big country but the characters jostle each other; Above all, wait until the end and you will understand how to kill a story (imagine the same thing in "Titanic"). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a bad scenario is saved by a brilliant filmmaker. Unfortunately, Hudson is poor. He has already committed "Greystoke" and I find the same flaws: no dynamics in the scenes, in the editing, in the notation: it is long, dull, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew that this film was a disaster for Pacino's career: now I understand. Finally, this last film for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: painful ...
