Four best friends, young male chauvinist pigs (who focus on pigs), meet weekly at a New York restaurant to tell their sex in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator that dates the three singles of the group, resulting in conflict and the inevitable "whip". Although the film has potential and there are fun times to live, overall, the film does not work, especially in the end, where girls do not do better than guys, which is contrary to the heart of the story. "Whipped" is one of those young men who think "The Man Show" is an Emmy material.
