After waking up at 3:30 in the morning without being able to fall asleep, I decided that I might as well be entertained while suffering from lack of sleep. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here is the plot (which could spoil you, if you care): a neurotic man with a sweet addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temperament for a ridiculous society. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to "leave permanently", which seems to be the favorite motto of this film. But with safe work and a secure income within reach, Josh decides for some stupid reason not to want to do it. He desperately overwhelms several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" letters in a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is just stupid. Josh meets and cheats on a female lawyer and they find themselves in bed (obviously, a fantasy of Josh in real life, because such a thing would never happen). There are many other things going on, but it is too commonplace and foolish to start. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is presented as a comedy, I laughed only twice during the film; The first time was Josh Kornbluth's opening move (my first reaction was a stifling fear) and the second when he was in bed with the pretty woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying person I have ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight and bald Jewish man, whom I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with Josh's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I simply do not appreciate the lack of humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
