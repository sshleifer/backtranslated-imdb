The film had a good concept, but the performance was not up to par. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, at the story level, it's "Dirty Harry" and "M". A child murderer began to terrorize a city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer yet. In desperation, the mayor and the police chief secretly hire the local crowd to speed things up ... to get to places and do things the police could not do to stop this mess on as quickly as possible. . <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p > <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> In the end, this movie has really good things to offer. </ p> <p> In addition to the concept, I liked the look of the killer's lair. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has a mysterious sewer. In some shots, the light bounces off the water and creates undulating reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a terrifying and dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who improves with age. <br /> <br /> Once you have exceeded this threshold, the film deteriorates more or less. <br /> <br /> The film is rhythmic much too fast. The investigation process of both teams is in a hurry, instead of being complex and fascinating. This could have been corrected in two ways: either lengthen the film, or cut out some of the many secondary intrigues. Either way would have allowed the crew to spend more time on the mystery itself. <br /> <br /> To illustrate how serious this is, one of the crucial clues that helps them better identify the right suspect is this: at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop. .. It's true ... I'm totally serious here. It's as if they go from point A (the first clue) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped all the "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones I really liked were two pickpockets that you meet about halfway through the movie. Considering that it is about minor characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the angle of the crowd. It's the one that gets me the most because that's why I spent $ 3 to buy the DVD. I mean, what a hook! There has been an overabundance of serial killer movies over the last 10-15 years. The angle of the crowd was a gadget that could have helped it rise above the rest ... but that was not the case. <br /> <br /> I thought the gangsters' methods would be brutal, but fun and exciting at the same time. ; a bit like a self-defense film or something like that ... maybe they would also add some high quality film elements. We are talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we have received some of the most repulsive protagonists involved in celluloid. The detectives interrogate witnesses. What is the crowd doing? They interrogate and kill them. It's not even as if these witnesses were really so bad either. In fact, I found the criminals less sympathetic than the murderer they hunt. <br /> <br /> Unless the positive arguments I mentioned are sufficient to arouse your interest, I would say that you should neglect this one. Maybe one day they will reuse the same story idea and do it right. I hope. I hate to see such a good concept get lost.
