A novel of Note. A casting that looks great on paper. A refugee from the left struggling to stay in Paris between wars. An undercover officer of the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> Too bad there is no synergy here. The pieces are never confused. <br /> <br /> Stories about left-wing refugees in France should not be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or his "Dialogue with Death" (idem). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest of this film lies in some accessory details. <br /> <br /> The main roles spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman brandy. I welcome any incentive to have a pinch of Calvados myself. It certainly made this film go faster. But, according to the film, it is sold only in cheap and lower class sedans. Long live Parisian tobacco! That's what I said. References to intoxicating liquors abound here; this would seem to be a concern of the writers. <br /> <br /> I like the movies taking place in France, because it can be fun to wait until the inevitable announcement in large format appears on a wall in the background. I was not deceived. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would give a rating of 10 if we judged it solely based on the sophistication of its murals of alcoholic beverages. <br /> <br /> The score of the film, indifferent, is Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you can call it that - for his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on O'Neill. It debuted at about the same time as the version of the movie starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in one or two recordings of Lawrence Tibbett. This should soon be resurfacing though; they are running out of potentially marketable operas to relive. <br /> <br /> The opera seems a suitable subject to mention here since the character of Charles Boyer operates under his pseudonyms "Czech". Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", two important roles in German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The deletion of the name seems to be part of this film. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters of "All Quiet on the Western Front" of Note. <br /> <br /> Well, the jokes are all in place; suppose there was no time to develop a drama.
