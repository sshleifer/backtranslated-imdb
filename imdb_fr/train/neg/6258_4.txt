Screenwriter-director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his own play to a recently widowed blood man who has learned in the past three weeks that he is HIV-positive. he finds the homosexual partner he has ever had, takes him to an apartment and ties him in, forcing him to take a blood test on the guy and promising him a bloody revenge if the results are positive. An intriguing idea sounds better than on paper. James Marsden's captive is realistic, cynical and arrogant, but the actor's unnatural mannerisms are disconcerting - it's like watching a version of Tom Cruise on tour. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the toughest role, but his personality, which goes from shy guy to kidnapper, is not convincing and the conversations that both men have had are not either. Marsden's gay party animal is not apathetic, of course - he's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's fate - but he does not react or behave like any homosexual man in this case. The film is not exactly a loophole, but it is a fraud, handicapped by bad editing, poorly designed flashbacks, low-budget production and the grand finale that releases a stupid pretense and a soapy melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
