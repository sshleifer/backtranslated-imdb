I did not really like the first movie "Cube". It was a good idea, but the annoying game and the characters kept me from loving each other too much. I did not really feel the need to see his sequel, but when I heard, they were doing a third film that would rather prequeline to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that they might solve some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Zero Cube" begins pretty well by presenting us with the two characters responsible for monitoring and maintaining the endless labyrinth of traps that undermine the inhabitants of the Cube. The filmmakers manage to create a sense of mystery with the setting up of the daily routine of the two men. There are a lot of questions about why people are sent out there and the true nature of the people who run the whole thing. All are left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a little weak, but overall, the first half of the film went relatively smoothly. <br /> <br /> As history progresses, one of the two "observers" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And later, decide to go help a group of people trapped. It's here that everything starts to dissolve quickly in a dull cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the leaders of the program Cube, we discovered the character "Jax". With his two subordinates play a major reason why this movie is a failure. For starters, "Jax" looks more like a third-order villain shot directly from a James Bond movie with the ever-popular "glass eye", which alone destroys any atmosphere created by the relatively pleasant rhythm of the first half. -time. Plus, it's starting to look more like a comedy than a serious movie. With incredibly old-fashioned lines, the screenwriter may have been bored and has nothing to do with it. The game itself is further degraded when the old "observer" meets the group in the cube. The whole interaction is painful to watch, as is everything else that follows it. <br /> <br /> If you do not succeed in impressing the weak characters, chatting and playing the "Zero Cube" is a waste of time for those seeking a good horror movie.
