A movie not bad but not so good heist. Kirk Douglas is a prisoner who has just been released from prison and who, after refusing an offer from the Mob, has decided to withdraw himself. He recruits gymnast Giuliano Gemma. The chaos ensues. Douglas and Gemma are soon pursued by the mafia, Romano Puppo, and are entangled in a really crazy love triangle with the infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps up the pace quickly and there is at least one creative and excellent car chase sequence involving Puppo and Gemma. Although it is an Italian production, the filming seems to have been made mainly in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just in a quickie Giallo. Bolkan's shot gives an extraordinary performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography of the great Tonino Delli Colli, who has managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
