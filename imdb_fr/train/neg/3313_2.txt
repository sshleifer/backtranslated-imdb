How can we say that this film is a comedy? If I had not been with my client, I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was as if she was badly shot. I like most girls movies, but I hated this one. This is the only time I have seen so much breeding and I have not been lit. These outfits were well exaggerated. Nobody talks anymore like that and I do not think they even did it at that time. The dancing part was horrible.My ex said to me later ... "Did not you like this part? Did not you think it was sensual?" I said yes only to spare his feelings. Now, I know why we never got married. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
