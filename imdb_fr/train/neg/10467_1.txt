If there was ever a call to make a bad movie that reflected how stupid humanity could become, it would win the prize. The plot is centered on Bible prophecies that are based on hidden messages from the scriptures, which incite a group of thugs in search of power to try to take full control of the world. How does this writer believe that people are really stupid? <br /> <br /> The acting game was bad at best. Casper Van Dien lost his talent for this film. Michael York's work fit the role perfectly, since he was at the center of the film and doing a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was disgusting and very disturbing. No tender or immature spirit should see this movie. This is how a basic plot against evil can go astray. <br /> <br /> There must be many mental illnesses floating around the circles of the film, who are looking for ways to market this type of junk food. There must have been something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still awful.
