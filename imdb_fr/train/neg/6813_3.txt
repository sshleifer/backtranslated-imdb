Jean Rollin is an artistic nonsense about vampires, extraterrestrials and the quest for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and the photography is stunning. The dialogue is insane. It's a laughable mess. Excellent to watch, but like a semblance of horror film or purely awful thriller. I'm trying to find out if we're supposed to be scared or not. At the same time, is it a blow or not? It's a strange mix of art and horror film that never quite meshed. Although nice to watch, it never seems to say anything, and it's not at all scary, even if the occasional shooting or sequence creates a moment of pretentious silly shudder. A live wallpaper for those who love naked women.
