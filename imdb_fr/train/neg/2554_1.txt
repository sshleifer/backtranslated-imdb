Honestly, I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have an ounce of originality in its fragile dialogue or flagrant plagiarized narrative. I can not even start counting the number of things in this movie that are obviously ripped from "The Omen" and other similar films. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this film is actually one of the devil's servants sent to guide and protect the laying of Satan ... Does this look a lot like Mrs. Baylock? Another thing is that the orphanage where they first burned the child only a few months after its adoption, as in "The Omen". However, fortunately, a priest survived the fire and escaped with several burns all over his body ... yet another coincidence ?????? And to top it off, the burned priest stays in a hospital room with images of Jesus on all the walls, much like the priest of "The Omen" having Bible pages stuck on the walls like wallpaper . Please, do not even make me make comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you because, as I said above, there are too many to mention here .
