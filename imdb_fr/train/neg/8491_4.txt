Despite some sometimes original touches, such as the "virtual sets" that constitute the background of Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and his entourage, this film falls away and eventually disappoint. The newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented, but lost in Emmy, a character who, in the middle of the film, is reduced to watching a monitor watching Lady Ada tell an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera lingers on her facial expressions, her manners, even making her appear as translucent or momentarily invisible, breaking down into scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" rendering of her. <br /> <br /> A simple biopic by Ada Lovelace would have been worth it, but this film unfortunately makes an impression of both the life of Lady Ada and that of a computer scientist of modern times (and his diabolical boyfriend with large drawings).
