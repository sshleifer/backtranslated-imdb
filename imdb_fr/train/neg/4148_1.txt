I chose this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the film and soon found myself immersed in a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally understood. what does hell look like? It's this movie. For eternity. This film has no value. There was not even any real plot. There were problems in each scene, but no general explanation explains why something is happening. Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you cover the nearest blender with oil and try to stuff as many balls as you want. can. You will find that the result is much more enjoyable than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even look at him. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you look at it, it means they win.
