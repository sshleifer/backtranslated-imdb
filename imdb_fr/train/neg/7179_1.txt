Whatever the meaning of his "message" - this film is a terribly constructed train wreck - a dreadful acting game, a lame camera job - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to stutter - he is really bad. You look at the extras on the DVD and the way it is followed by a camera - it permeates it - it loves to be the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. How was this film shown in urban youth centers and New Age churches - damaged people in search of reinforcement and attention wonder how the film touched them and maybe even -he? sappy.
