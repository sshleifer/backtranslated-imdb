The opinion of foywonder on this cheap STV hits the mark. Be sure to read it. In case this is not the case, a group of scientists will visit the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest to search a cemetery of animals with a pile of bones. The Big Foot family does not like that and selects the team one by one, largely off-screen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly monkey-like face, but is generally less frightening than HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS 'Harry. Most of the film presents generic actors in wood posing as scientists who frolic in the woods and frolic. It's a budget-free film in which very little happens, at least on screen. We watch the sexiest woman shower while one of her companions watches, but nothing comes from it.
