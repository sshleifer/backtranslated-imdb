Many of the main characters in Hideo Gosha's "Hitokiri" in 1969 (homicide, aka "Tenchu" - punishment of the heavens) were true historical figures (in "Western" format): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo. Okada, ____ Anenokoji. The name "Hitokiri", a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who repeatedly murdered Tokugawa Shogunate figures in power in the mid-1800s under the leadership of Takechi, the "loyalist" leader. (ultra-nationalist, pro-emperor) of the Tosa clan. What was this fight? Sad to say, you will not know it in this movie. "Brilliant History Lesson" indeed! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual sharp edges and bloody dice and (to an absurd length) the inner turmoil of the less brilliant killer, Izo Okada than in revealing the real story. Sakamoto, for example, was a person of historical significance, considered the father of the Japanese Imperial Navy. The closest Gosha who teaches a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist cause, goes to Takechi's mansion to try to influence him ideologically. He begins by talking about the international political situation, with foreign warships in the ports of Japan and a Japan too weak militarily to defend against them. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosha cuts this potentially fascinating lecture in the middle of a sentence (!). That's all for informing his audience of a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film left me in complete confusion about the objectives of both parties in this fight. During the two and a half centuries in which the Shogunate occupied central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change and preserving the feudal relations of society. He feared external contamination, both ideological and technological. In keeping with this spirit, he banned firearms, those "leveling" instruments in Europe and the Americas, with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai. Throughout this period, the emperor was no more than a spiritual figurehead. <br /> <br /> But in towns located in neutral areas between feudal fiefs, a new class of merchants, landowners and artisans was developing - the class known in Europe by its French name, the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it took offense at the many limitations of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became the central figure of the bourgeoisie's struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy. But political leaders do not always fully understand the interests of the class they serve. When the outside world arrived with great fanfare in 1853, in the form of "Black Ships" of American Admiral Perry, the ruling elite of Japan was projected into a crisis. Their army was no match for these strangers. In addition, they had heard about the ravages caused by the French and British imperialists in China. What should Japan do to protect itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements of the shogunate, generally isolationist, were inclined to open trade with foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technologies. This is the point of view represented (hardly) in Sakamoto's film. On the other hand, ultranationalists loyal to the emperor, represented by Takechi, thought they could remove foreigners by force, if only they could prevent the other faction from "selling the country". (Does this sound familiar to you?) So, the assassination of key figures of the shogunate is in order - and off you go. <br /> <br /> Takechi's motives have been, for me, the biggest puzzle of the film. Gosha suggests that he fights mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the Loyalist cause. Can we take that to represent the content of Loyalists as a whole? (Are you interested in this?) <br /> <br /> Several critics have favorably compared this film to Goyokin, which Gosha made the same year. But, where "Goyokin" is a sparkling, suspenseful thread of adventure, with a hero worthy of sympathy, "Hitokiri" is walking heavily, far from being so convincing and lacking in such a hero. Sakamoto could have been the hero of this film, but we do not have the right to know him - or what he represents - enough for him to reach this status. <br /> <br /> In view of his wonderful scores of the previous five Kurosawa films, the score of Masaru Sato was very disappointing, resembling something rejected in an episode of "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
