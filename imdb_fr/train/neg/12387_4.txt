Lipstick is another glossy movie failure. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie and I'm having trouble finding something. I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing at the end of the movie Writing and Scripting was not the worst I've ever seen, but it was a lot better. The lipstick was very nice to watch. The sets were very bright and pleasant to watch. The distribution was correct. I thought that Anne Bancroft's character was the only realizable character in the entire movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting his time with this one.
