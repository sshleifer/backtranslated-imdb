I'm a big fan of old westerns and I do not think Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help this 1957 film that presents almost all the mundane features of the reformed shooter westerns become good guys. a fallen but virtuous woman, fanatical townspeople who must turn to the shooter for salvation, etc. Any nepotism there? I saw better playing in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I already reached the 1000 words?
