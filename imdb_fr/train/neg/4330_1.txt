Last night, I decided to watch the prequel or should I say Carlito's Way pretext - "Carlito's Path: Rise in Power (2005)" that went straight to the DVD ... no wonder ... .. quite .. .and i mean completely S% & KS !!! I did not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this film worthy of a movie .... except for A fact that I take my hat off to ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante. .. reminded me how De Niro entered the skin of Brando to represent the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro It was incredible and I even had an Oscar for that !!! Jay Hernandez has the courage to try to be a young Pacino .... too bad for him, I do not think he will play in a movie and besides, after watching this movie sh # $% Ty, I sat down and watched Carlitos' original way of getting the bad taste of my mouth.
