I'm very tolerant of the very bad sci-fi and horror movies - I've been watching them since I was 4 or 5, so I've seen some very bad things, but I'm doing it. I even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies, so I know we should not expect much - a generally promising and endless movie. I guess hope is eternal - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, it was a dog from the beginning and I knew it, but like a moth in the flame, I always thought that something interesting was going to happen. It's not. All actors give a decent performance - given the scenario, I do not know how they all kept their face straight. This has something to do with parasitic creatures without collagen that slowly invade the human race one body at a time. There is a diabolical plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of the man ... do not worry, he gets what happens to him. The slug people themselves do not really know where they come from, they think they may have stolen from a meteor that landed on Earth, but ... they know somehow the members of the slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows she is the queen of worms and who loves her for herself ... oh, should I continue? Please, I beg you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this ... everything would be better ... think of the most enjoyable and least pleasant way to spend two hours ... would be better than that.
