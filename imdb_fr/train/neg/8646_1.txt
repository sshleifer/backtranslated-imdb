This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was going to get up and go to band 4 but I held it. I now consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is this idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. Aside from the bad acting and the zealous upset of the camera, I thought the events of September 11 were a reason for "Larson the Lunatic implode, on a screen near you" to be outrageous and irreverent to the victims September 11th. Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, supposedly from one of the planes held by the terrorists that day, was appalling. The shaking of the camera did not make me sick, unlike this cold cascade.
