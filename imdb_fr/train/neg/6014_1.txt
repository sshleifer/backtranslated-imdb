Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than $ 17 million. The acting is weak and uninteresting, the story is even weaker. The audience is asked to believe the plot is totally implausible and often laughable and to receive nothing in return for its good faith. The film is not only misinterpreted and scripted, but it is sorely lacking in all the technical fields of cinema. The design of the production does not contribute to the credibility of the action. The effects are totally unoriginal and flat. Lighting and overall continuity are inexcusable. even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter to the extent that millions of families will undoubtedly adopt the film for its purity and religious tendencies. And who can blame them. However, it is unfortunate that they are forced to accept higher quality films.
