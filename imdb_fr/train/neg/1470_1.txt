Last night, I was looking for something to watch in our DVD Tower. We were between NetFlix shipments and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one I had never heard of before and realized that it had been borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a scam of "The Big Chill" but, with the distribution of the stars, it deserved to be watched. Boy I was wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was a scam almost character by character. The character of Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt (role "Where have you been all this time") - spoiler warning - and, here, he remains to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Jamaican jamist Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I wondered why I was even watching these people. The development of character was insufficient for me to find an interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" even find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even funny, except that when Perkins fell, the first morning was a sign I missed. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Were there endearing characters in this movie? ... Do you sleep there?" She said, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, I can not think about it."
