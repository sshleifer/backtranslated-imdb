I'm going to go on the record as the second person who, after years of using the IMDb database to search for movies, was motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned, to create an account and post a comment. It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" were added in any way. The acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing. How this movie was saved and came to be is completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find is the cunning and repetitive use of the word f by Anastasia Hille. (and its brilliant design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or getting me into trouble with wild trouble, I would face a difficult decision. I am disappointed that I can not give it 0 stars.
