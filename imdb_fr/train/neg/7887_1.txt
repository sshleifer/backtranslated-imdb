... so they'll have a place to drop that shit. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, is a religious mumbo jumbo. I continued to wait for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised to me, but the "evil" in this film would be unimaginable only by a five year old child with learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can not believe they actually managed to find bigger names names ready to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, this has forever changed my opinion about them, and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I'm also a little sorry to have a writer's name and the director's name to memorize now, because I'm going to avoid everything they do like the plague from now on. <br /> <br /> It is really regrettable that all the religious fanatics posted here and saying that this film is 10 out of 10, etc. will receive their reviews first. It could lead to more people, like me, being misled into believing that this film was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's up to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. Too bad they can not give me the 105 minutes I lost thinking it was actually a horror / supernatural movie in Hollywood.
