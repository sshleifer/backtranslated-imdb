I am a fan of artistic films, but I must unfortunately report that this film is a pretentious behavior. Lamentably slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, difficult. Even after bad movies, I have the feeling of learning or appreciating something, but there is nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends there. The acting was OK, even though the characters were completely boring. For the protagonist to aim for such a bold goal, it is extremely empty. Pity. I generally enjoy movies that are not formulas, but the lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
