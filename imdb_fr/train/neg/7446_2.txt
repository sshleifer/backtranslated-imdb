I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only useful presence in this film. But even so, do not see this movie. Even if he's good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the boy) and in fact, I did not care if the star meets the lovers who end together or die The film did not give me the importance to believe or believe that these people were interested in each other. I read a lot of "classic" novels after watching the movies and this movie did not even make me want to read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sens and Sensibility and she was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or a mini-series like the Forsyte saga. Go see them, do not bother with Lorna Doone.
