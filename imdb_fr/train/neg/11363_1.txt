This film was announced on the radio, on television, in magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every number. So when we went to the Kinnepolis Multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh my God, how sad this movie is! It's a movie in Hollywood that talks about a film in a movie. Shades shows so clearly that we are not ready to produce "great Hollywood movies". I'm not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject says, it's nothing, and then closed. You can also watch TV without seeing anything. It was the feeling we had when we saw Shades. Shades is a bad production !!!
