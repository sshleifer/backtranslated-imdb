My wife and I thought that with this cast and this director, the film should at least be interesting to watch. We were wrong. In fact, we dropped it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to exceed - hard to believe that it's England when no one speaks with a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone else, and to echo a previous comment, it is ridiculous to think that Cooper and Crawford declare their love for each other for no reason. There is no reason to worry about the characters, so we threw in the towel halfway through. I had a hard time believing that Hawks directed this, as none of the actors spoke of the Hawksian rat-a-tat trademark. So save your time and skip this one.
