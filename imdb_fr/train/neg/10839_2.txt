This was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as the children's comic book! I gave it 2 out of 10 for its attention to detail because, in most cases, it looked like the 70s and the three ladies who played the three original angels looked like them, so makeup was good. <br /> It was supposed to be a biography of the biography chain but it was devoid of anything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interviews with cast members, team members, production team members, etc., nor with their friends, families, and biographers of these people. In fact, I know the program as much as I knew it before watching this movie that was based on the (so-called) biographical book. With regard to actually learning something that nobody knew about the program and was not a good common knowledge that never happened.
