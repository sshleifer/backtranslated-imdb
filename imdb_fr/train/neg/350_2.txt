The performances of Fishbourne (which seems strangely funny) and Ed Harris (abbreviated) are remarkable, unlike that of Connery who does not seem to make sense in his role and leads to the driving behavior of an 80-year-old man . In fact, the scenario does not make sense. imagine a 60 min. good end-plot more a sudden turn appendage without any argumental structure with regard to the characters. It is more of an accident than a scenario and can be good for the exam in the schools of writers. The more you remember the details, the stronger this impression. Capital punishment is not a problem here, although it has been a subject from the beginning; it disappears in a way without further comment. The material and the environment could have been good.
