Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham make a good match, describing very different brothers and sisters, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or substantial to his role. Leigh, who plays the bar group singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, is relying on her older sister, Georgia, a popular singer acclaimed in the mold of Joni Mitchell. Perhaps because of her dual role as co-producer of the film, Leigh seems to have locked herself in a corner: she is not credible as a singer and, even if it is intentional, she spends much too much time on the screen at the cinema. microphone. Probably hoping for a tour de force, Leigh is nervous, nervous and torn; however, we simply do not see any talent in this character (Leigh is obviously a strong actress, but here she makes decisions that isolate us from her). If Sadie had any charisma or appeal, perhaps we could accept the idea that she would get the (small) breaks she made. As things stand, her chances of going on stage are slim. The director Ulu Grosbard realizes some intense dramatic sequences. The editing of the finale juxtaposes the performance at Sadie's bar with Georgia's sold-out show - both singing the same song - and it's a sadly nuanced moment ... but really, what's the point? * 1/2 of ****
