I was very excited to see that they made a movie from my favorite book. I did not realize it was Disney before it was too late. I was shocked by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a movie from the book of a 4th-grade novel. Meg worked well at school and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not described as a scientist at all. they left his kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the Internet. And that's just the beginning. Halfway through the movie, I found myself screaming on the screen, much to the dismay of others watching the movie and not reading the book. I would like to have more inches so that I can give four thumbs down for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for someone who has not read the book, this movie is going a bit well.
