The second of the Vacation series is by far the least pleasant, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family in Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless humor and under the belt that worked so well the first time is virtually non-existent here. This fault surely falls to the director Hackerling, who is obviously not as talented as the director Harold Ramis and to a very uninspiring scenario that only has a few decent lines scattered. <br /> <br /> The distribution does what it can; Chevy Chase infuses some form of life into the procedure, but that is simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely lost in a small role of very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not exploited to their fullest and leave the viewer especially annoyed. All representations of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost not at all funny (as the English are SOOO polite). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, there is hardly any laughter in sight and the end turns one into a full slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like me), the movie is viewable, but no more than that.
