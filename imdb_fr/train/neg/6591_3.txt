It's the sound of Stan and Ollie turning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to list the basic flaws of this film because they are so obvious that they go without saying. Little things, like "The new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" although the stars have been dead for more than thirty years at the time of its manufacture. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to have actors playing jesters called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it may be, it might have worked. For a very bad idea, try to use two actors to imitate the duo. Okay, they can pretend to be nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Okay, forget about his strange stranger "Cousin Larry" schtick in Perfect Strangers, and watch it in True Romance. Here, however, he stinks. It's probably not entirely his fault, and like the director and the support team - who are all better than the material - he was probably desperate for the money. Some claim that Americans have trouble mastering an effective English accent. Pinchot does not help this cause. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? It is close to Stan's trademark, although the voice is too heavy to be boring, so there is no need to talk about it. Gailard Sartain is a bit better than Ollie, even if it's like saying the worst: getting into the mud of dogs or kicking the crap? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with their timing in a fraction of a second, their intuitive teamwork and their lovely beauty? Well, it's completely absent, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes so badly done that you can park a bus through the holes. While the originals had intrigues that could be summed up in a few panels, this one has a long hummum Mummy hokum (and what ugly title!) That mixes with the scenario of the fraternity of the boys. I can not claim to have seen each of Laurel and Hardy's 108 films, but I think it's a safe bet that even their nadir would be a step ahead. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were sort of themselves, or at least using their own accents. It seemed at least natural and unconstrained, unlike the artificial caricatures that Pinchot and Sartain are given. And since when does Stan do misproportions, and so many others? "I was going to make you a standing cremation"; "I would like to marinate my friend." Stop that! <br /> <br /> The only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the comic book character who shared Larry Harmon's comic book, L & H. Harmon of course bought the name copyright (disconcerting from see a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this parody. <br /> <br /> The questions are not lacking. Would Stan and Ollie make gags if they were alive today? Would they see mummies with broken bottles? Is Stan being slammed into the genitals with a spear and ending on a grand CGI finale? Let's hope not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think it was just incredulous, how terrible it is. Why was this film shot? Who did the manufacturers think they liked? Perhaps the worst film I have ever seen, an absolute horror, I got tired of watching after the first five minutes. It's as much fun as getting stuck in a vise, while a red-hot poker and nettles are forced into your back passage.
