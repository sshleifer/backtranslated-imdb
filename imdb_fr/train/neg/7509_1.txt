"Why?" <br /> <br /> This simple question must have been on the lips of every New Yorker during the 12 months of terror created by David Berkowitz in 1976-1977. This same word will surely become the same thorny issue the summers 22 later, when people will come out of theaters by presenting the "Summer of Sam" banal and exploitative. <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee tries to weave the story of a group of lost people. thugs in search of the famous psychopath - who paralyzed the city of New York for over a year - with an austere and graphic depiction of murders, demons in Berkowitz's head and the frustration of a vain hunt for man in NYPD. It presents a set of despicable losers who hear their own "barking dogs" as they lead a life devoid of love, honor and humanity - regardless of Berkowitz. Lee thrills the audience in almost every frame with "none of us are what we seem to be". Often critical of the white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing the role of a young bridegroom with a deceitful husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have an oral sex with a black man "in the back of a big black Cadillac. " An Italian mobster told a black detective that the capture at the center of the famous Willie Mays was "lucky". Lee even makes sure to deliver the racist thoughts of a middle-aged black woman who says, "I'm glad it's a white man who kills all those whites because if it was a black man who killed all those Whites - there would be the largest race A riot in the history of New York. "<br /> <br /> Aside from a remarkable first panoramic shot showing an arrival at a disco (recalling plans of" Goodfellas "Martin Scorcese or "The Third Man" by Orson Welles,), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. He scrolls characters on the screen devoid of human decency. Although we do not know the true victims of this terrible holiday, Spike Lee seems to say that the city of New York got what it deserved during this scary and boiling summer more than two decades ago. <br /> <br /> such ravages on his beloved city? "" How could anyone show such hatred toward his neighbor? "<br /> <br /> Are these questions appropriate for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
