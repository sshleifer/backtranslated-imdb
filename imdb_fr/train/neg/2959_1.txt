No matter what someone tells you, the word "possession" is a fact in cinematographic circles, like "what did you own to give the green light to this film?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense has it. That is to say, if your head is clear and you are sane to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels, I tried to rationalize where this movie would entertain ... or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A boyfriend movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On, my God! I'm sure when it was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere in the course of development ... someone should have indicated where the idea could not translate into entertainment that someone would want to watch or pay ... unless they're very much under the influence alcohol or drugs. and saw something that the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a total mess. Disorder, disorder - a sin and a disorder. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) et al. Whoopie had a paycheck, but I would have been embarrassed to receive it. I hope she has fired her agent / manager / publicist for this career change. Obviously no, she went on to do more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
