I must say that this movie is a Mork and Mindy spilled, looking at it I had chills, I even wet a little. When this Korean with spiders in his neck started beating people, I was like oh my lord, Asians smell and suck because they eat dogs all the time. In any case, Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of an ordinary non-robotic human being. Some people compared him to his early days, when he was a car wash analyzer and he believed in the holy ghost and ghost of the Christmas past. This film is so bad that I put my newborn baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris's mailbox. He can raise my child. I do not let him into a world where he thinks Norris is a karate expert. I let him see what it looks like in real life for the rest of his life.
