Let's see. In the finale "St. Elsewhere", we discovered that there was no hospital and that everything was in the head of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended up telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended up telling us that all this had happened in her mind. Very creative. "Boring was more like that, yes it was just a TV show and it was not a reality at all, it's just that when you're caught in a great movie or TV show, you end up wanting to at least believe that everything is "real" at least as much as the reality it portrays on the screen.This type of finale of the series had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and all just not fun to watch Now that "Newhart" is a dream, at least it was done creatively and far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show. not so appealing, but it was so brilliantly designed that it's arguably the best final in the series - Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.
