Like many people, I saw this film at the theater when it was released in 1997. It was at best an underperforming film, without being the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans love. make. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter how you look at it. People just love it because of its appearance. His acting "talents" are essentially about saying a lot of cheese replicas and trying to play sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a pretty boring and simple plot: a girl falls in love with a guy, shoots them on pits, many crappy love scenes afterwards. Anyone with an IQ greater than 50 will realize that this is by no means ingenious. It's not original either. In addition, the director felt the need to drag him over 3 hours. I could compress it into a block of an hour without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated film to date. Why it has attracted so much attention and money is beyond me.
