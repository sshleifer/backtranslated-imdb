I totally disagree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I did not rate it 1 because it was horrible was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of his talents of songs and dancers. <br /> <br /> The problem comes from the rest of the photo. Alice Faye is pretty hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with his miserable writing material, he's doing so terribly nerdy. <br /> <br /> The plot is really difficult, Ameche assuming two roles as singer, dancer and baron not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that by playing the singer and the dancer, Ameche's marriage gets a second change. Some absurd absurdities about the fact that the baron is obliged to fix everything and that he is absent allows him to play both roles. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal has little to do here and so his comic gifts do not have the opportunity to shine. Ditto for J. Carrol Naish who seems uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a shocking bomb chica chica from a movie.
