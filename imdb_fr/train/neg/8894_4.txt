This film is an embodied phoniness, a mere 11/10 on a phoniness scale. The false accentuation of the accents and the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are simply breathtaking. The Yanks, although the real Scotland is so colorful, do not expect a chance to "dance" the controversies with locals. Do not try to persuade people of the art of tap dancing either. <br /> <br /> The scenes of songs and dances are contagious, but the plot is much too linear and too old. the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt that anyone wants to get stuck in an 18th century Scottish village with a time fracture in the dark rather than the gay city of New York. Perhaps this priest had not made such a sacrifice of leaving Brigadoon, perhaps he was only trying to pull the devil out of this slum. <br /> <br /> Look at him to see the beautiful alternative-reality vision of what a parade of Christopher Streed Day in Scotland would look like LSD. Apart from that, I would only recommend it to Hollywood finnishists.
