From the beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and weighty that the result is quite predictable. Any good scenario writing manual will recommend superimposing characters, incorporating arcs of characters and a three-act structure. In this movie, you will not find anything of it. The police are the bad guys and, therefore, she is presented as shallow, incompetent and cowardly. The directors of this film never seem to imagine that the police could be an honorable citizen who considers that being a member of the police force is a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer has no opportunity to be reconciled. his mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film begins with his arrest for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him go through the door of a prison, but we only know he's been inside for three years when we hear him much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the movie a real chore to watch. This is the direction of modern movies, and this one discouraged me from watching more.
