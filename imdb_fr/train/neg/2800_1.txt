One of my best friends brought this movie over a night with the words "Do you want to watch the worst horror movie of all time?" I still enjoy laughing at a bad horror movie and I said yes. I was expecting your typical cheese b-slasher, but it was beyond B. It's Z-slasher, the lowest of the bass. With an obviously low budget, an extremely bad acting game, a bad flash, no conspiracy, very bad special effects, shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack, movies like House of Wax look like chefs-de rewarded by an Oscar. The only good thing about this is that in about 15 seconds, one of the characters finds herself naked - she had very pretty breasts. Most of what I said during this film was of the type "Wow, it's really SO", "It's the worst movie of all time" and "I'm not drunk enough for that" . So, in conclusion: do not waste your time (nor your money!).
