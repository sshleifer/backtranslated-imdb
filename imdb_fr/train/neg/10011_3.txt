This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation into the circle of powerful men's wives. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I was wrong. The pace is painfully and extremely slow, even after 40 minutes of the film, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed in ten minutes. It's slow. <br /> <br /> The absence of shivers or scenes of action aggravates the boredom. It is almost shocking to see that even the argument scenes are so simple and emotionless. Perhaps it is because of the stiff upper lip of the upper social class? <br /> <br /> It is sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.
