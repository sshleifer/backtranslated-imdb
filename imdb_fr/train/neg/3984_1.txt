I saw this film a few years ago on the BBC where I sat. How? I do not know, it's good up there in the rankings "so bad it's good", Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to make faces when they see him now. I think Woody Allen would have done wonders with this wacky plot, and Baldwin's role could have been played enthusiastically by Leslie Nelson. It was again tonight. I tried to watch it again, but life is too short. The few minutes I watched were about the beautiful Nicole, she was so hot around 93 years old. Has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played her role in the "nice but dark" trade the F-word character coming out of her mouth when the lady of "burrowing" misinterpreted as a detective accusing him of murder sounds so fake. stay well away.
