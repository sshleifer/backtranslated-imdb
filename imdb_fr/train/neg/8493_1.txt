Many days after I saw Conceiving Ada, I'm always impressed by the fact that a group of people would spend so much time doing such an awful movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody should see this movie in hopes of learning something important about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. Likewise, no one should see this movie in the hope of being entertained. <br /> <br /> As a sci-fi movie, it would definitely be a horrible failure. In one way or another, the main character succeeds in reliving the past and interacting with him on his personal computer - with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt that anyone can suspend his incredulity enough to prevent it from appearing as absolute absurdity. <br /> <br /> As a dramatic film, it would definitely be a terrible failure. In one way or another, the screenwriter / director manages to complete eighty-five minutes of constant, useless, embarrassing and trivial dramas on virtually nothing. I doubt that anyone can think that all the dramas in the film serve only as an irritating distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances in which I saw it forbid me to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I am always sorry to have lost the time it took to see him. Only to be able to criticize this film more effectively, I would like to be more articulate.
