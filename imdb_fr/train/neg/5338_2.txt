Elvis Presley plays a "mestizo", an Indian ("Indian") who must defend his reserve against the bad business tycoons. Everyone loves to get drunk, fight and have kids. Fighting, fighting and "punishing" each other replace the stereotypical expression of the hand, "how"? <br /> <br /> Even though he is putting on makeup, it's obvious that Elvis is healthier than in previous films; maybe he was getting ready for his famous "comeback". It could not be because the script of this movie had something to excite. Joan Blondell who tries to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war paint" should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song to the bull "Dominic". There are surreal scenes, but it never gets hard enough to succeed in this genre; However, "Stay Away, Joe" could make you laugh if you are "in a good mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
