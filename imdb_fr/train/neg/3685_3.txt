The main reasons to see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who delivers a remarkable performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as the hotel's assistant director. Cillian Murphy, meanwhile, over-acted so much that it becomes caricatural. The rest of the movie is full of holes in the plot, which I will elaborate on. <br /> <br /> Do not read further if you do not want to know what's going on! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the plot. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) runs a hotel in which the new Director of Homeland Security, the uncompromising government, plans to stay overnight. Rachel returns to Miami after the funeral, but answers the calls of her assistant until the departure of the plane. In the meantime, someone is posted in front of his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa needs to do is phone the hotel and move the director's suite into one of Jackson's cohorts who plan to fire a guided missile (fired from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. . <br /> <br /> Here are some examples of absurd intrigues or coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the aircraft phones lose their connection. Lisa tries to make her believe she's making the call, but as if by chance, a man on the other side of Jackson's alley is also making a phone call and starts typing on his phone to say he's dead. Jackson hangs up and catches Lisa's phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point, Jackson and Lisa are surprised by the head, but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson surprises Lisa writing a note on the mirror in the sink (extraordinarily large), and he hits it a little. Miraculously, the only person who hears something is an eleven-year-old girl whose voice is obviously ignored. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in her throat as the plane lands, steals her mobile phone and rushes madly toward the exit, adjusting the hallway between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers . Although they know that a passenger has a pen stuck in the throat, flight attendants force Lisa to open the Jet-Way door. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all of this is reasonable (if not highly improbable). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the Miami airport terminal and there is no cell phone signal (all major US airports offer excellent reception for mobile phones). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs to the airport with Jackson in pursuit of the agents, and no security officer even delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport as the door train moved away from the terminal, lost part of his voice because of the feather he has in the throat, but it can still be a little understood. However, he does not bother to call his man outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but the one they showed was very similar to Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and leaves. Of course, this time, when she's going to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery" and goes out soon (when will they stop using this impassable tracing device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone was still saying "low battery", Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to rescue the director and her family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the 40th floor room on which the director had been installed. moved. Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the ocean. The missile would probably have been launched in the first suite, canceling the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What is the story here? The director's original room, located on the 38th floor, was one of the only rooms in the hotel with an unobstructed view? Nevertheless, everyone comes out just before the missile strikes. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes to Joe's house to save his father and see the killer outside. Although she tilts him (pulling him) while driving his jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice him or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's place and knocks him out (we do not see how ... maybe another whim). He then explains to Lisa that he has not killed his father yet, because he wanted his father to see him die before him (give me a break, what is it?) Saturday cartoons morning?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa home and she cleverly pushes him away. Of course, a real murderer (that is, an actor perhaps played by Jason Statham) would have eliminated Lisa (or anyone who is not a skilled killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this pursuit, Jackson spans Joe at least once without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson wins and he is about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) he is shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven not to give in to horror. Or maybe he should end up with Michael Bay (who directed the equally stupid movie "The Island") and create "Red Island".
