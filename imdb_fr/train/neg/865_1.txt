I had the misfortune to witness every 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shocking film. This fails at almost all levels; the casting is awful, the acting of actors at best and the intrigue devoid of depth, leaving me violently apathetic as to the outcome of complicated stories. <br /> <br /> Plan B does not have the charm this genre has the ability to convey and I found myself physically exhausted at different times when the scenario makes its usual ill-judged meanderings anywhere to the region of the comedy. <br /> <br /> A real movie of sarcophagi coated with saccharine.
