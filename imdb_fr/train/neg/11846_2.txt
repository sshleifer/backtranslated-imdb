After watching this film, I complained about the quality of the soundtrack of my local cinema or the possibility that the cinema audio system is defective. During at least the first half of the film, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying, because of the background music and the sound quality of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the movie material but that was not the case - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and sound had to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. These days, the filmmakers will make every effort to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you see this movie, the score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, aside from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find yourself elsewhere), the soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to miss this movie. You will only hear the distorted sound of the soundtrack and certainly not the meowing of a cat.
