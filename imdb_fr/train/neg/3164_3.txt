Eva Longoria dies murderous on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her in the back of a truck and kills her. She then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with her new girlfriend, a clairvoyant who can see her. <br /> <br /> A film not original and obvious would not be bad, other than that The character of Longoria is odious and hateful to lose all the pleasure of the film. It's like cleaning your ears with sandpaper. To be fair Longoria, nor any other member of the casting or the team, is not the problem, it is the dreadful script which weakens the debates. It's really really stupid.
