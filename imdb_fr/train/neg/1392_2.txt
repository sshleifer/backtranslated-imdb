AKA's "Gray Matter" "The Brain Machine" but people in the video have thought better about it; the screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. The government has a primary interest in this project of "brain machine" which recruited four people - who turn out to be basically a philosopher, an excited priest, a veteran of the crackpot and a patriot who had an abortion - a room narrowed with a computer that can read their horrible secret thoughts. In the end, the government seizes the laboratory by force and everyone dies. Here is an incompetent film in all important areas; MY s *** has better production values ​​than that. That was important to me, though, just to see what these exploitation filmmakers really thought about doing, playing in the four-person drama. The answer: a leaflet on how science is inferior to God. Thank you so much. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, Gerald's philosopher "Republican Simon" McRaney. Also presenting very, very, very long sequences of editing and transition in large quantities, it advances almost as slowly as the liberal congress.
