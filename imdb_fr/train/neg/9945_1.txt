After watching about half of this movie, I noticed something special ... I found myself constantly changing TV channels to see what's going on elsewhere - it's not really a good feature. movie. <br /> <br /> This film is listed as being in a number of genres, and I must say that it has almost completely failed. 80% of the movie, I went instead to watch an old replay. In conclusion, the whole film had the impression that those who realized it did not know exactly what to do and ended up in a decoction without discernible taste.
