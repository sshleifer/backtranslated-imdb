So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and presents the synopsis of a political thriller taught. It's worth a look then. That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End Game is the most ridiculous plot I have ever had trouble with. Now, being a bit of a thriller, I can not really go about it as I wish without "ruining" it for those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions such as "Why did he / she / they do this?" And "Where did they get the resources to get there?" are too numerous after the unintentionally hilarious conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, you know these movies where you can almost feel like an actor has realized that he made a terrible movie mistake, and that shows in their performance? This is one of those. Accompany him with a ludicrous scenario and a seriously wrong and irritating direction. You will have the recipe for cinematic poison. leave it in your living room; it is appalling.
