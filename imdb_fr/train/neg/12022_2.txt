The idea of ​​the story is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution drops. <br /> <br /> The film lacks rhythm, for one thing. This should be an exciting ride, but it's slow and more than a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem lies mainly in the scenario and editing. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to increase the suspense, and there are scenes that do not really advance the story. <br /> <br /> The producers should have seen this in the scenario and insist that rewrite major. Unfortunately, when the producer is both screenwriter and director, this obviously will not happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting game seems pretty flat, and it's up to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because with better writing, editing and directing, this film could have been a very good thriller.
