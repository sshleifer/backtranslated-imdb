In spite of all his visual pleasures, how much the Renaissance would have been better in real action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, maybe the film world would not have felt so lifeless. There is a lot to admire here, but in the end I discovered that all I could do was admire. I did not really like the movie and it clarifies something I had never seen before: visuals can be the decisive positive aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters, all of this can only be for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not lead to anything, but sometimes it gets closer dangerously. I love Dark Sci-Fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films that I found wonderful. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain and Dark City had its story that prompted reflection. The Renaissance has shadow and light, but little more. I wish I could have loved this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters were an obstacle. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic brilliance of colors and life. How ironic that one of the darkest and lifeless movies I've seen this year is from the Renaissance.
