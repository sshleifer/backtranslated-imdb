When I went to see this movie, I had high expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was exactly like all other horror movies. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Exactly like Resident Evil and many other movies. But the difference with this movie and other movies is that the story is very weekly. They are bad actors and boring music. The picture is OK but the rest is total shit. Do not see this movie "horror", see the Ring 2 or any other movie that is much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies about a virus and spreading the virus and inciting people to become zombies. We have seen enough. The only good thing about the movie is when they stand on a roof and film infected celebrities.
