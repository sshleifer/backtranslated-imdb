I would not say it's a * bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I feel that the more you know about fencing, the more it gets worse because it becomes totally unrealistic. I have been fencing since the age of 14 and this film describes it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some background in fencing), but most of the other actors - especially the students - just seem to be lost.
