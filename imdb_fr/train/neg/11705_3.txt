This stifling melodrama is very easily the worst film I've ever seen with Ingrid Bergman. Even his presence on a bright screen can not save this unbearably slow and winding film that is almost impossible to go through without filming fast. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans of Bergman; others may fall asleep. I suggest you look at "For whom ring the knell" instead.
