THE CHRONICLES OF ZOMBIA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> While Looking for a (literally) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young journalist (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells him two stories involving flesh-eating zombies, reputed to haunt the region. <br /> <br /> An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hindered from the beginning by the painfully amateurish performance of Haggerty in a key role. Worse still, the two stories that make up most of the race time are completely routine, exacerbated by indifferent performances and a lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, formerly behind CAMP BLOOD (1999). It's not a "fun" movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are "fun" (at least he believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made films are, in fact, annoying, boring and almost totally devoid of redemptive virtue, and most viewers will rightly feel angry and deceived by such unimaginative and ill-conceived junk. The 3-D format is totally wasted here.
