The acting was horrible and they had both sports to take ... not only did they misinterpret the rules of figure skating, but they also respected the rules of ice hockey GIRLS. In GIRLS ice hockey, you can not check. You do not block for anyone either. Not all girls are disgusting and mean. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11. I was asked to go to schools like the movie. In addition, not all hockey players hate figure skaters. Many female hockey players used to be figure skaters. Plus, we skate MUCH faster than those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the film that gave people the idea that we are dead ... although I must mention that it is difficult to make the transition between sports because of the sting on the skates of the figure ..... also some KAtelin was doing two of those on the ice that he could not do in a regular hockey game. It basically tripped the person, which is illegal. It is also unrealistic to obtain a HOCKEY Fellowship in skating. It really made me angry that the purse would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
