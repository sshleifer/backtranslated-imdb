If you're trying to create tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it beyond total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers have not yet understood it. <BR /> <br /> This film is void, unlike the majority of his characters who (if you have not worked, they are vampires in the first minutes and then you're ashamed of you), a preference that Limits the abundant supply of "no one knows where I am from cheerleader types and homosexual dinghies who move comfortably and with a bragging fast-food in front of their lonely door. <br /> <br /> The only bit of originality of this plot is how these vampires become vampires at first. Location, but the rest is ridiculous and sloppy. <br /> <br /> Forced to mount sticks (as opposed stakes) on a regular basis because of their fondness for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are not too bright. If they fed their victims, they could run their own small blood farm and it would reduce the death rate, allowing them to settle and become nervous. <br /> <br /> Why producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and homicidally gay older brother I'm not sure. He added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate since there was not much intrigue to start with and no shock value. <br /> <br /> We never said why the parents were dead, unless of course it was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. It is clear that the social worker must have been alerted to the family for one reason or another, but again, it is up to the viewer to write his own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character is the youngest brother who emerges as Pugsley from the Adams family. Indeed, he was much too round, having the appearance of a child who inadvertently lost a Weight observer class to a very bad horror movie. Oh my God, he did it. Never mind, my dear, take another donut with a delicious blood center.
