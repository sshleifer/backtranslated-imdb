"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Given the people involved, it should have been better several times. <br /> <br /> Look at it, if you are at least somewhat attached to the belief that everything will be better, you will probably cry. It was one of those films that had potential, but was stripped of that potential with a terrible storyline and bad acting, not to mention the annoying and useless character of George Clooney and the guy who recalls Richard Dreyfuss, but who cares? so little that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only salvific advantage of the film is its strange vocabulary of con it introduces. I found myself thinking about it over and over again, watching more and more police capers. That's the only reason I gave a 3 to the film. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and very unfriendly. They are in a state of constant agonizing stress and they are all so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They scream at each other and swear foully. The dialogue is at best tasteless and insulting at its lowest points. <br /> <br /> I find that Steven "Traffic", Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes, if anyone remembers that shit long enough to care.
