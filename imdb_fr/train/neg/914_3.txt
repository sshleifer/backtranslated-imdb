(Criticism in English, Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this film with extremely low expectations, and I can unfortunately inform you that the film is up to them. <br /> <br /> Although I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson again on the big screen, writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water are neither original nor amusing. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that are not, is just boring. I smiled like three times during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The location of the Swedish products Findus is (unintentionally) amusing, why not a big sign saying; "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not need to be seen in the movies or on DVD, wait for it to be broadcast on TV, it will not take too much time.
