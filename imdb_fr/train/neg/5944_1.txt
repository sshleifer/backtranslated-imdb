This is not really my genre, this action street fight on DVD is the one I met only thanks to a friend who put it while we had a few beers. I am rather open-minded and very fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat there ready to have fun. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, a former prisoner turned street. fighter for obscure reasons that unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a tedious movie. I understand that movies like this one do not rely heavily on the plot, but should they be content with such a stupid, predictable and completely stupid scenario? It may not be important, but it does not annoy me. Better no plot and pure action than a bastard of fleabags of a story. Impregnated with a sentimental conduct totally unfounded and irreproachable, it is the cinematic equivalent of a turkey with thin skin and stuffed with rotten viscera. At this point, I should probably mention what is, of course, the movie's attraction: the fights. Even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. Bone manages to eliminate well-established street fighters with a punch (a big effort or two is the ludicrous attempt of filmmakers to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a silly stratagem. Even this is repetitive and stupid, the broken arms and the faces struck with a constant eagerness that we manage to see again and again. <br /> <br /> A mill movie, movie by numbers that deserves full direct DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen over and over again. And not even particularly well.
