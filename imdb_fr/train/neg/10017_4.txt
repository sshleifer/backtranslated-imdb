"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to unfold in a world without stain, a bygone era, where the greatest sin a child could commit would be to defy the law and get a ticket. It begins with a young automotive fanatic who deals with the affairs of her great rival, who pushes her into a car race. That's about it for drag racing - this B-movie is about rock'n'roll, man! The people at American International were obviously fond of decent, squarish teenagers who enjoyed partying and did not care about adult chaperones. There are some twofold meanings and fun fruity exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we were going out to get some fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think you'd find it in his throat?"), But the ghost is a little late. In short at 65 minutes, the film deceives us with a decisive car race that takes place off screen and a pre-screening "Scooby Doo" that makes no sense. However, for lovers of nostalgia, some stupid fun. ** from ****
