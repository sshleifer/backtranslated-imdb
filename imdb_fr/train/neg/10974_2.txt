I am Irish and I live in Denmark for a while. I could not wait to go home last week to see Intermission. And I will continue to say: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS AWFUL. <br /> <br /> This is not as serious as "The most fertile man in Ireland", but it really does not stand out with other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are rather amusing, like that of American Colm Meaneys. But the film itself is shot completely wrong. The bouncing of the camera and the constant zoom, zoomed out, try to give the film an edgy aspect as if it were a dramatic drama. But it's not. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Smoking, and she should be turned that way. There should be a smooth movement from one shot to another. The film is just sloppy and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The performances are acceptable, given the appalling scenario. A friend of mine told me it was as if they had just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He makes a decent presentation as Dublin's Dirtbag, but that does not compare in any way to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was given by Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman, who has just been dropped by her husband, bank manager, for the benefit of a younger woman. I think she should leave her terrible stand-up and focus more on her acting. <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not correspond to the expectations that the Irish press imposes on it, nor deserves it. to be even considered one of the best Irish films of all time. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for feedback from these comments, because most of the people I talked to said it was great. But before answering, ask yourself the following question: Would this film, if it were held in England or America, please you so much?
