"John Hughes' son wrote a drama in high school! Wow!" I thought that when I checked the movie info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, I found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie and, unfortunately, it was downhill on it. We can say that you can not spoil a film as poor, but I will leave critics out of this criticism ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of style for very little substance: unfortunately, the style is not too dated eight years from its publication. Basically, the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under brilliant veneer, an insignificant or irrelevant argument does not materialize. The characters are painted in broad childish traits, fitting into the kind of generic stereotypes that the writer's father sought to challenge in Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping up the pace (perhaps relying a little too much on information mounts, which quickly become a tiring device, but at least move forward information), do not minimize the script and the weird cast (how anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox', when Blake Shields scolds and stares at the role, I just can not understand), without talk about the many holes holes in the plot (I'm all for the creative license, but when the "bad guys" know the identity of the "good ones" making their lives a misery, but do not act in any way to stop them, you really need to ask yourself why this scenario has not yet undergone a few re-drafts before production - daddy even read it?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger audience could enjoy it (and have the power)), but they'd better stick to Hughes Sr.'s high school production, and if the idea of ​​rebellion at school On appeal, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying examination of the subject.
