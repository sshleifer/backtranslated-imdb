I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, even if I do not agree with all that Bush has done in the exercise of his duties. And I love the daily show and report of Colbert. They must be two of my favorite shows on television. I love bush jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy who ever walked on Earth (I think he's not the most stupid no more.) It's not really funny anymore. I see where it can be funny and it's (hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious). The central comedy is just trying to make fun of him. I mean maybe a special episode, but a whole series is just stupid. It seems that CC is only repeating the same jokes we have heard over and over again. I really can not see this show go beyond a season.
