I'm going to give it a 3 just because it shows that we need to know the story to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of the gentleman from the United Kingdom. The movie was pretty terrible. Any clich√©, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look for the technical specifications on the DE 529 or any Everts destroyer escort and you'll see what I mean. I'm going to Black History Month in the United States now and I'm going to be labeled racist just for saying that, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did escort work, chased a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk they hit. Sorry, but the Blacks did a lot more during World War II than this silly movie credits them with. This film makes them look like moans. As the name starts, I can handle it.
