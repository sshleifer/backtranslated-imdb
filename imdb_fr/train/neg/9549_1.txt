I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken before watching the movie. Bad plot, bad science, bad acting and all in all, a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I did not like the folding of the plot to defeat the idea of ​​the terrorist threat. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had directed thousands of warheads on the United States. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill a terrorist in training before becoming a threat. Politics aside, one of the positive aspects of the first film is to show that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of ​​the futility of war. No idea of ​​this type is proposed in this film.
