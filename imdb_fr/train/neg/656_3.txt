Note: I could not force myself to write a constructive critique of Prom Night. It just can not be done. Instead, I went through what I thought while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> What I was thinking about watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, but the main character will wake up just before bite him. Of course, when I say "complex deaths," I mean lashing the throat or stabbing in the stomach. Is the whole thing "it's just a dream" ruined by Dallas? Speaking of which, I wonder if a stab in the belly will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> - The film is only ten minutes away and I can already count horror shots with both hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I'm sure he'll die. Does anyone want to bet? <br /> <br /> -The killer of this movie is a teacher obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think "Donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) He spends three years in a maximum security prison before going out and finds Donna in the process to celebrate his graduation party. Although there is no justification for the taste, I seriously wonder who would take all this time to track down someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow balls to take place in hotels and do not keep track of students. Apparently, students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and to go in and out as they please. I guess if this scenario was not there, the movie would be 90 minutes where people would get bored and bite the dust every time they went to the bathroom. I guess the compromise for their enthusiasm is my total boredom with everything. I've already played "Count chewing gum chews under the seat" and "Guess how much money I have left in my wallet" and I'm only 20 minutes. If not, how am I going to be entertained? <br /> <br /> -Note to yourself: Do not forget the milk and bread on the way back. <br /> <br /> -Dear writer: You used enough false fears to cross this film. and all the other horror remakes of this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of this film was not very good, but compared to this remake, it looked like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. He had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his many horror movies post-Halloween and he had a little "twist" in the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish it to act more. <br /> <br /> - Apparently, at the prom, there is not much dance. Instead, the girls argue with their boyfriends about where they will go to college. I hear all these appointed colleges and I can not help but wonder who these girls should be wrong at the entrance exam to get in. <br /> <br /> - The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning products and wipe his disorder between scenes. This is the only logical explanation for stabbing someone to death on the carpet or in the bathroom, and when someone gets into the hotel room, there is no trace of struggle. (On another note: he's a very lazy killer, Michael Myers went looking for the victims, just words.) <br /> <br /> -It's official: all the public theater attacks the murderer. What triggered it? Was it every time Donna went back to her hotel room while the sirens sounded, ordering everyone to leave the building? Was it about her constant dreams and how, even after going through something dramatic in her dream, she insisted on representing herself thoroughly? Or was it the unconvincing performance of Brittany Snow? I must say that was all the above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who "had the death of the screen in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> -Finally, the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says "Donna was not too smart." This is the least we can say of the week. It is a bit like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a power failure lasts a week, which is a slight inconvenience. <br /> <br /> -I can not wait to get on rotten tomot and see if anyone has done it. move a favorable opinion. <br /> <br /> -I can not recommend it. I refuse to recommend it. It's as lazy as horror movies, and the only way to enjoy its cheese-scented story is if you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theater guests, alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * on ****
