Just a regular Jason Lee movie, there were some parts of the movie that were funny. The nuance of the move is to live life on the edge, I guess. These are the types of movies that 14-year-old girls watch at their pajama parties. It was a good movie. It's a bit of one of those movies that you have in the background and you watch from time to time when something catches the eye. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and a good plot. It's just a kind of movie boy meets girl. It's that perfect movie that they would show in Central Comedy. I'm glad I did not see this film in the cinema, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I did not see him at the theater.
