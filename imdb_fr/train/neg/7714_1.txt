Oh yes, damn it, the MooCow will reluctantly confess the truth: I'm kind of like this cheap parody of the 70s. The idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the United States is an excellent idea and, in spite of himself, the film provides decent laughs, as well as the sight of terrified extracts fleeing from large, obviously false tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the previous attempts at parody, which became so popular in the '80s and' 90s, largely thanks to Airplane! This one, like the periodonest moost, is rather poor. Many attempts at humor are lamentable failures and will cause many moans. But thanks to hordes of voracious tomatoes, the unpleasant song "Puberty Love" and the great scene of the helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes provides products, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There are so many things wrong with this movie ... and so it's hard to explain. Enough people should also enjoy it while the Tomatoes are back in 2 moore movies and a series of cartoons !! The big pieces of time spent away from tomatoes are rather boring. And dig those 70's clothes, man !! ; = 8) This tomato is fat and cheesy, but deserves a laugh or two; the MooCow says catch a pizza and pop in the tomatoes !! : ??
