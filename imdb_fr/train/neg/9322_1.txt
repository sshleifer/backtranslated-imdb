Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you are looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh: it's not that. Usually, I'm going to be stupid if it's funny, but it's so stupid that it made me stupid (or maybe even). <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than a handheld, but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key of a Casio keyboard. These problems should never really dissuade to see a horror movie, but you have to add this incredible casting (crying), and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a guy who invites his friends to watch her family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also addresses the invitation to his lover for his wife in his office. On the way, they meet a woman in distress, who is then invited to come by the other girls. <br /> <br /> The cabin experience includes sex and nudity. Soon everyone's panties are complete. A girl disappears and strange objects appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From here, you (the audience) and the morons, hum, actors, try to understand what is happening and they are starting to be wary of each other. Overall, I think I made it sound better than it is. The main difficulty of this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, that the plot is artificial, that the acts are bad and that the motivations are unfounded. Once again, it could be forgivable, it was a bit funny, but alas, it is not the case. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist is just a twist in which no one would guess it simply because if you thought about the film it would not have made sense anyway. Please do not let this criticism prevent you from seeing the shear wonder of this movie. (Woah, my nose has just grown eight inches.)
