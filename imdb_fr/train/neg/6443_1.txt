I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in the making of propaganda films and in boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the film could be a documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but be another liberal and unimaginable effort to reprimand the Conservatives and the local religious community. It seems quite normal that the filmmaker makes a documentary that reflects only his preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising is to see all the "10" votes that his counterpart has published here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman, this must be classified with All the men of the president! Their notes are as obvious as the bias of this film. <br /> <br /> Yeah, like piling up votes at IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote will help balance that.
