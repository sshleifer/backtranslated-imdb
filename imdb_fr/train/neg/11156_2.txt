Dark Wolf (quick review) Let's get right to the point: it's a disgusting piece of slaughter on the road with cow fish on it. It's just a horrible movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with the worst actors imaginable and a story as weak as any gangster nerd from an 80s high school drama. What's worse is that the poor Kane Hodder was tricked into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. Kane and Hodder. Someone is trying to make Jason Voorhees' role at the pinnacle of his film career ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, former playmate Jaime Bergman , is also in the movie and she ends up becoming a werewolf. It's a kind of shitty crime drama with the worst werewolf in the world. But there are moments of almost rampant nudity. But that's about all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is usually an ugly-looking black blur that slips around the screen. And when we're lucky enough to see a transformational sequence, we're presented with something that looks like a full-motion video from a video game created at the very beginning of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The animation of CG is really this primitive. Only good for horror hardcore fanatics who want to see little nudity moments surrounded by creepy visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
