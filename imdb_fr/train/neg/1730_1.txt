First of all, I would like to point out that I only know the show because of my younger sister who is still watching her. I find the most annoying program on television. None of the "jokes" is funny and canned laughter is unbearable. The series would work much better if it were filmed in front of an audience. In this way, laughter would show how "funny" the show is. However, I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. It makes me sick, however, to think that they will come back to the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show fits nicely with the annoying voices and style of CBBC presenters. Why do today's young people need to be so cried out to me? That's all.
