There was not an original idea in this story. The themes were drawn from various sources; some being The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Folly (another Carpenter film), and The Ring. He even went so far as to represent the same glowing circle of The Ring and use it as the name of the film. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was anything but out of Suspiria. I hope no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Deep Red d'Argento. Claim a tribute would be a loophole of bullshit. It was at the bottom of the barrel. Throwing annoying and "disturbing" images into the jar does not make a good horror movie. Carpenter knew it. It should disappear in the dark or acquire a machine to go back in time.
