A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not shot for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asks his clumsy cousin of the director to drop him off in a poor neighborhood of Carlson, South America, to conduct a research about the work of the head of a small supermarket. He sees the wonderful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is attracted by his abilities. Her driver never comes back to catch her and Scarlet takes the actor. But first she goes through a job interview for the secretary position in a construction company and the actor helps her get ready. then they spend the afternoon together to spend a pleasant moment. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a screenplay, and is backed by chemistry and improvisations by Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in reality, nothing happens after 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, Morgan Freeman's character returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that he would never see each other again. Was he afraid of having a love affair with her and destroying her perfect world with her family? Or was it a clash of classes, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be suitable for a simple worker from the lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A star in my life")
