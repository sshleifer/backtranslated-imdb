I am a huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I like Stephen King a little less, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> That said, I should have liked 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS ITEM **** <br /> <br /> I came in with impatience. I came out disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles, because the principle of the film puts Cusack in the scenario of the "guy in a closed room". <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but I can not call it a good one either. It was a confused mess that had moments of "ouch, it's just FALSE", combined with moments of "ouch, it's just painful", and moments of "oh, now it's just a shame" with very little continuity of connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once and there is no apparent connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive in the room. <br /> <br /> A previous speaker described Olin / Enslin's point as interesting, and I totally agree with him. But apart from that, apart from some clever musical tricks (the room almost whirls Enslin in a playful way, and gives him a chance to get out before climbing the bar ... which gives him the countdown of an hour and Carpenters' line "We have just started.") It's mostly "stuff you jump in when you least expect it!" a horror type that was fun when I was fourteen and surrounded by friends of my age who were standing in the summer while Jason followed Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was "Let's relive some of her most painful experiences" Mindgaming, with "let's animate the paintings in a scary way" clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I was expecting better from this film that is associated with the name of Stephen King, as well as actors I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never discover the origin of evil. We never succeed in seeing the evil vanquished, even though we can assume that it may have been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the end was just a jerk "What ?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for him to come on the cable. I would not mind paying in the morning, but I feel a little unfortunate to have paid the price of the opening night.
