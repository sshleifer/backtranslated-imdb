I can not believe that many compare this movie to that of Argento. His work is much more imaginative and vicious - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply does not have the ability to create real tension. Murder scenes - and let's face it, that's what this kind of thing is - are not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really did not care when it was revealed. Cinematography is not memorable and the gothic atmosphere of the nineteenth century, which has been highly praised, just did not attract me. Several actors are very good (especially the director and the sadistic girl who dominates her in the youngest students), but You have very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are nuances of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add very little spice or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
