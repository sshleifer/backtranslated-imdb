This film gets a score of 6/10 from me, and a score of 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror film for the crowd of standard horror movies, where action, gore and fears are taken into account, this movie will bother you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you see on the Lifetime channel, but in a horror universe. The story and formula are ancient, retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for originality in the structure of the plot or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you'll get something as melodramatic as a wit, tripping over cheese. This is the 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic synopsis and the idea are quite original and overflowing. It's literally something that you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk. . . but this joke is actually a theatrical release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is because they could have gone even further, but they did not do it. <br /> <br /> The mixture of the two is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as in most comedies, it was not so funny. My mother and my little sister watched the movie with me and the jokes we told were more fun than these. There were moments of absolute genius, but also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films will take this kind of exaggerated risk and original ideas. I just can not say it was perfect, or almost, because of the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> A BIG family movie. A good movie to watch with a group of guys (or girls). A good movie to watch with anyone. . . but if you look at it alone, it will be a little boring. Other people always make this kind of movie more funny and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
