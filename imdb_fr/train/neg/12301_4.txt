Oh my ... bad clothes, worst synth and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80's come back with revenge in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, directed by the infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the side of production and director short of staff (thanks for the small miracles), directed by Fabrizio Laurenti . Presented as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (nicknamed "The Casa" in this film), Witchery offers humble, modest purchases and misbehavior. <br /> <br /> A mixture of ghost stories, goods and witchcraft, the film bounces back and forth without any sense of scene without leaving serious actors and hilarious mixes day and night to slow down its progression 'to the expected end, topped with a serious climax of surprise WTF. (I love the look on his face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti manages to gather a little suspense and an air of mischief in some scenes - very little -; Unfortunately for him, these few glimpses of a sweet movie magic are collapsing quickly and efficiently. <br /> <br /> The positive sides are known when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite efficient and entertaining in the classic latex style and red 80s Italo-gore painting, when everything was handmade and as shocking and lively as modest budgets allowed. I could only watch with sadistic joy and laughter all the extravagant manners that unpleasant characters (and actors) were mutilated and abused one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who has apparently never been tempted by this good old role of girl / woman possessed of his career, or at least if we come back when he looks at his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much more to tell, let alone to tell at home. Do not expect too much when you spend a rainy afternoon with this, and you will probably experience a bit of fun. It also helps if your little rotten heart beats to the horror of 80 euros. And speaking of heart, every film where David Hasselhoff is trapped by a large metal object and bleeds profusely around the room and hallways, MUST have one in the right place. <br /> <br /> It's my truth - what's it's yours?
