I should never have watched this movie. The filming style can be considered artistic, but it is considered to cause migraine. I think he may have had an interesting plot, but since I could not watch him for long periods at a time, I missed him a lot. The flickering images and the stop motion shooting marked my brain. I stopped looking halfway and I will not come back a second time. I guess if I was alone at home in my own lighthouse on a dark and stormy night, maybe that's what I was looking for. PS: I do not know if the flagship / film style can be considered a spoiler. blacklisted on my first exam;)
