Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is hardly there. Most of the time on the screen is dominated by funny jokes. A running gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There is also a lot of jokes about erection, where the typing line is that someone has an erection. This film is as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started as a low action movie: five minutes of story, then bam! Unfunny jokes. But, apart from the terrible writing, the film is also poorly made and the acting is terrible. In addition, this film makes the old clich√© of the bad comedy to have many well-known actors of the movie B. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the characters who Spend more time on the screen than Rodney, even though he is portrayed as the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a pharmacy that sells for five dollars. Even that's too much.
