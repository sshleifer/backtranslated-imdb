Flay and Mario Batali, the little bobby "Salsa pineapple", reduce this problem. <br /> <br /> Certainly a pony ride, I think they could have brought other American chefs to the table on this role as Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duet offers is really ... do not think about the creativity of Iron Chef's original series. I do not think Batali even went to the chef's school. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they do not appear on Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also be helpful to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-facilitators to handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a bit too casual / funny for this role.
