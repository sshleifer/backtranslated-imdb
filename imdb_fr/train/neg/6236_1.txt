This film was the most offbeat and most fueled movie I have ever seen in my life. (In addition to Farenheit 9/11). All the information is corroborated only by the opinion of CINQ scientists, while 80% of the Associated Press strongly criticize the science promoted by Gore. Global warming is mass media hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information contained in the film was either badly quoted or totally wrong. This film has been the subject of much research and it has been proven that his lies are nothing but lies. <br /> <br /> WITHOUT LIBERAL BLUAGE! To think that they show it at school proves that the media made us think of the garbage!
