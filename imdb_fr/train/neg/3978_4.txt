When In Rome is a definite improvement to get there. To get there, I found it too predictable, artificial and slow, and to this day, I still consider it the worst Olsen twins. However, if When In Rome is not a terrible movie, it's not a fantastic movie either. If I had to summarize in one word, I would say passable. It's fun for teens, but I think adults will not find much to do. <br /> <br /> When In Rome has its good sides. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty. I will admit that around 10 years, I really loved them and in general I still love them. And I enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back to the target, the two girls are not doing this difficult job, in fact, they are very attractive. In addition, their outfits are to die for and the landscape of Rome is breathtaking. The soundtrack is not bad either. <br /> <br /> However, the film is filmed in the plot and in the scenario. The script is largely clich√© and has allusions to an already seen. The plot, like most movies by Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone who already knows the work of the Olsen twins will find something unoriginal. Most characters are thin cardboard and you learn a little about them, and sometimes the rhythm is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking landscape is marred by a rather sloppy camera work, which seemed hasty. <br /> <br /> All in all, he has his good points and is quite visible. However, to my taste, these are harmless and predictable teenage stuffed animals. 4/10 Bethany Cox
