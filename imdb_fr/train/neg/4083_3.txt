I saw this movie at the time of its release, and my aversion to the movie haunted me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image of the Tempest and make it literal. If a character said, "My heart takes flight", we would be shown a real human heart, with pigeon wings attached, flying across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process gives lush paintings, but it's finally an easy exercise. And it becomes terribly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not regret the pleasure that other viewers have found in this film, but it is good to know that not everyone was delighted.
