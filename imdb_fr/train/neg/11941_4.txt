Even if it blocks a good joke, the humor is usually pretty dry. The group members often make faces or use foul language and wait for the crowd to applaud jokes. <br /> <br /> Another comment says that I do not think it's the best RTE ever did, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of the mind, there are some really funny smart gags that would really make you laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the names of well-known comedians rather than judging the quality of gags that are not really good. Overall, it is mediocre with some good bursts of laughter but it can often be pretty mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I find Benny Hill more funny.
