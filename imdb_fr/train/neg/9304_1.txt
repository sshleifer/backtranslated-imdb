I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but it's probably the worst! I usually like silly movies, if they are somewhat entertaining, but I can not even think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for the sake of heaven. But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting, lame music overall, and even the sex scenes sucks! We should compare the lameness of this film with dragons such as "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs. the Demonic Toys" or even "Very Brady Sequel". Although it is far worse than any of those. I beg you, do not even waste your time. Believe me, her 2 hours you will never come back.
