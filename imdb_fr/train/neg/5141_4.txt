1914 was an incredible year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in the movies and he appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not particularly good, they allowed him to slowly evolve his character on the screen. However, by this film, the character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Of course, Charlie seemed to play the role, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency he developed later. Instead, Chaplin would often hit, kick or do other unpleasant things for no apparent reason at all. <br /> <br /> For this very light film, it's interesting to watch for the casting. Even if they do not know today, Chaplin plays alongside Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that, even if it has some beautiful scenes, the plot seems very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Mabel went to the race track (a theme very common in Keystone productions - it was to be located near a race track). Charlie and Mack introduce themselves and sneak inside. Mack is pursued by the police as Charlie slaps Chester and steals his daughter. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack - leaving Charlie to Mabel (who, curiously, did not seem to have been shocked by Charlie's rude behavior). <br /> <br /> A great lover of silent comedy or film historian, it is a very forgettable film that only matters in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors are really doing on stage, although it's not unusual for a Keystone movie, is not particularly funny today.
