Gadar is one of the most overrated Bollywood films. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make a vintage film gives a film of waste. The songs were boring and this is not the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, at full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for his silly movies, where he beats alone a hundred villains. He even kicked a metal prison gate (Indian) and a distant car (Teesri Aankh). I can give 50 other examples of shameful actions of Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. Sunny gives a pathetic performance by repeating the same kind of role. A guy claiming to fight for his country, using violence. Amisha Patel is dead sexy with an incredible body that I really like to bone. But even she could not save the film from a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as she usually does, she does not do it in this movie. Maybe because she played the role of a Muslim, but she does not behave as such in the movie. Overall, it's a mediocre show from the start. I'm sure it will please some, who like to see the Bollywood actor being beaten by 100 guys. Leave me alone.
