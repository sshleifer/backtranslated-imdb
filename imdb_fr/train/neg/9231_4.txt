I went in this film thinking that it would be the next clerks, but I felt disappointed. The humor was weak and the characters rather flat. That's not to say that everything was bad, the idea of ​​a dating service in the grocery store seemed like a pretty fertile material, but the director shifted his attention to the cliché "save the Mom-and-Pop store from the perverse society guys ". I had the impression that if he had just stick to the plot of the dating service, he would have released a much more memorable film. Now, to do justice to the film, I come from the Rochester area and I love the way he described Webster. In fact, the best tribute of Kevin Smith (clerks) here was to give props to his hometown. Webster, NY must verify what Red Bank, NJ is to employees. The director wisely made an appointment to Nick Tahou. Believe me, when it comes to things to do in Rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky to see this movie at Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when the odes to the city arrived and appreciated them.
