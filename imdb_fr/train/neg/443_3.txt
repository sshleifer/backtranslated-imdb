Overall, an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slow to build the basic scenario. The role of Maria Schrader in search of the secret past of her family. (Each take seems to last forever ... there is really no rhythm in the film.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is saved from the Nazis by a German, played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotyped. *** SPOILERS END *** The film commutes between New York, Berlin and 40s. Please, when you do this, give the audience an indication of the exact time at which the story unfolds. There is never a clear indication of the weather ?? very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and rumors about the Jews being terribly tormented, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Leave me alone. That's how the Jews came out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who released the Jews is NEVER solved. Was Goebels the one who liberated them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an interpretation prize for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Must be the Jewish theme ??
