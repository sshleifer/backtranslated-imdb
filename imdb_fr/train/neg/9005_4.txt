If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci-fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one. The film begins in the merry old England around 1100ad, then returns to present California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new chief of security and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground. It happens (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the main scientist and we quickly discover that it is a cloning laboratory and they have something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? Like the movies above, all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting caught. The special effects on the monster are good enough for a "live to video" movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for. But forget the rest of the group because we discover why we have never seen them before. Again, do not enter with high expectations and everything will be fine.
