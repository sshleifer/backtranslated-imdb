I searched in a video store everywhere to find this movie, being the big elvis fan that I am, and found it a huge disappointment. kurt russel had most of the elvis movements down and the imitation of the voice was excellent, but the sung elvis voice was just not working for me. the voice did not always correspond with Russel's mouth, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. Plus, there were so many frightening contradictions in the movie that people who do not know much about Elvis would probably think that these are facts. The songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time he got his first guitar is wrong, I'm pretty sure his brother, Jesse Garron, was buried in an anonymous grave , not with a huge tombstone reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they skipped important events, like the special return, and dragged scenes too long. if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in its prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS, or another elvis concert. Hearing and seeing the real preform of Elvis is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement that I know, but still ... go out and rent a good cop elvis.)
