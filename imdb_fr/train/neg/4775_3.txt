What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the Saw series, but his game is even worse. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The end is ridiculous and the story does not contain twists, no surprises in the plot and just a bad end. I liked certain characters and I hoped that everything was linked to the end. It does not happen. It's a total "Wrestler" that ends with none of the good actors. I can not believe I spent the time watching this. It's not "fun" as some people say. A guy in a mask removes people who are connected and forces them to understand. The connection stretches and he should have filmed the main actress first.
