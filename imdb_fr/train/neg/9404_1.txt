This absolute absurdity is so closely related to the Friday 13th series that it is practically a true copy, accepting as an Australian film with people who can not play. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, a boy was accidentally burned while filming a video clip at Lake Eildon. A few years later, the boy became an adult and takes revenge on all those who come to film a video clip on the lake. It's a clich√© and a waste of time and money, only see it out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn to NOT (can not) act. The main role Alan Dale used to play on the Neighbors soap opera, but ended up in The X Files - how did this happen?
