Another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be turned into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined when adapting the book to the screen.) The story is based on a veteran lawyer, still on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old Gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even if the accident was in some way his fault, because he was not paying attention while driving. The father of the deceased Gypsy woman casts a spell on the 3, our main character, Billy (the lawyer), getting thinner more and more each day. Although the film remains in most cases with the book and it ends with your typical king, the acting game has been steadfast and forced. We went from one scene to another without much difference, much like reading numbers in a play. King himself made an appearance in the film (a bit like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay like this: the authors. Leave the game to the actors. Not that anyone in this movie was so great. I saw the main characters in movies where they were much better.
