I recently decided to go back to The Omen trilogy and discover that {insert demonic music here}, there is a fourth one. I did not expect much and, in this respect, he certainly met my expectations. If you like watching bad movies, then this movie may be right for you. Oh, where to start? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the movie's "TV-made" appearance was obvious. The music was often poorly adapted to what was happening in the film and therefore (at best) distracting. The screenplay had all the suspense of an eight-year fiction. But one thing to say is that the missing script was very well matched with the appalling game. Many scenes let me think that it was the scenario or the acting game that was the source of ridicule. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty skinny, centered on all the crazy antics of Damien Thorn's daughter, adopted by the nuns who acted badly and acted badly. There is the usual lot of mysterious and complicated deaths that made me yawn personally when the "drama" unfolded, and the usual third-party investigator in the whole affair. Later, through some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr was born. And that concludes just about all the plot. Everything is rather poorly executed from the beginning, the lack of suspense making the film a monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of WTF?!? moments also that provides the involuntary relief of comedy. For example, what is the overreaction at the beginning of the film when the baby scratches the mother's cheek? Barely a 360 degree omen. I also laughed at the excessive reaction to baptism. The baby is crying and everyone looks very worried. The mother in distress leaves the church and the priest is very worried crossing. Huh? Then there is the new age nanny who seems to have carte blanche to expose an 8-year-old girl to all sorts of alternative spiritualisms. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing Delia, a troubled woman, to a psychic fair to meet the hippie friends of the nanny and that the mother just shrugged and allowed it. "Yeah that's groovy, fill my 8-year-old daughter's head with the whole story of mysticism, it's cool, I do not have to be here." Of course, this is expected of a mother who allows her daughter to adopt an adult Rottweiler they meet in the street and who could bite little girls as a snack. The whole scene at the psychic fair is pretty comical, from the horrified reactionary eyes of the seers to Delia, to hell. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at how the death of the nun is considered an "extraordinary accident". Here we have a religious fanatic (described as part of a cult), who fanatically preaches in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove that the glory of God will protect them. She upsets the snakes by manipulating them and somewhere she gets bitten several times. Not really an accident. Rather a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The snakes-non-religious scene was not the only comic death. The low-speed car accident caused beheading in a school car park. Then comes the idling demolition balloon headed straight for the detective. I think maybe I went for coffee when the idle started coming back, but the demolition balloon was still heading straight for the "concerned" detective. Then there's the quintessential killer who kills, who kills death, a shot fires and both act as if they were shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified looks. Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs, revealing who the real victim was. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a little strange and useless. He runs looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously, finding it painful enough, he eventually collapsed, squeezing his chest and dying. Apparently, something demonic happened, because that's what the music suggested. Ummm. OKAY. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that other people have commented on this film favorably and, in particular, as a "worthy continuation". It is hard not to notice the non-sensual scenario, the unrealistic game and the inappropriate musical score. The film lacks suspense, relying heavily on the "evil look" of Delia to give a sense of horror, which becomes rather embarrassing after a while. <br /> <br /> Final result: This is a bad film whose only redemptive feature is its unexpected potential to become a comedy.
