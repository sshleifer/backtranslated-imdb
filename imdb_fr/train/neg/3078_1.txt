I did not think it was possible that a horror comedy movie would fail so terribly on both fronts ... really horrible. The fact that it does not take itself seriously (which is usually a good thing) goes against this, mainly because the actors are so much wood that you would really swear they read cheat sheets. However, the MST3K version has, as always, some bursts of laughter ....
