"Kids Like These" could have been a decent film, considering the subject treated. But instead, it became a banal TV movie of the week, with little success. The acting is obsolete, the plot predictable and the direction nonexistent. For a better movie on the same topic, try the excellent "The Eighth Day", a film that really cares about people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like These", they are simply used as an excuse for crying sentimentality. Pretty dreadful. 1/10
