I might have given it a higher score before the release of Peter Jackson's trilogy, but seeing them side by side is simply unparalleled. The rhythm of this film is precipitated, many important scenes of the book are left aside and the development of the character is weak. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoons and real action scenes that were painted, which I found disturbing. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it stops in the middle of the story and is never finished. There are some good points - the battle scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book to the letter. Look at this one if you are in a hurry and you can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused because it is missing a lot in this version. 4 out of 10
