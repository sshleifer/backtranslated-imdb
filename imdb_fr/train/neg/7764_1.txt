What is it ? A low budget sex comedy? Anyway, he perfectly describes the Spanish people. They might have a better idea, I mean, they've been doing these kinds of movies since the '60s ... and people love them! This is neither a teen comedy nor a family (you can not let your 12 year old boy watch two guys in bed kissing, he will never want to go to Spain). This should be noted "R" because only people 35 and over seem to be laughing while watching: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is an important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> The foreign humor is awful in the movies (except Kusturica), stay with the dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
