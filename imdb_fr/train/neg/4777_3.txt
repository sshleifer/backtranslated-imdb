The idea behind this film was good. Too bad that it is not well written. To make Sidney Poitier an FBI agent was a good idea and he did a remarkable job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been great, and even showed some possibilities, but the writer really let us down by making his role an essentially defenseless woman. This was totally inconsistent with the strongly independent character it was supposed to be. I do not care anyway for Alley. The film should have ended about fifteen minutes earlier than planned. The director dried the cow before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of the performances of Poitier.
