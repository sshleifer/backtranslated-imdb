here, let me wave my hands on the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad she's going to order. again and again, works like a charm: he is a genius, my God, how does he do it? my bullshit detector fears if I even get this show off when I sweep channels, I have to be very careful (these days, it's useful far too often, so I do not need it to break like a silly shit like that ... be careful with this remote!). Is it a fascist propaganda aimed at getting people to believe in an invisible kingdom of uberman control and mastery? or what? why is there? <br /> <br /> This is the most insane, completely incredible and unnatural show, and I do not understand why it's still airing. so, that geeks can give so much better shows (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but let this stupid stupidity pass. programs like Firefly (if there were any) go out after a season, but stupid things like this, which makes no sense, continue to work. yeccch.
