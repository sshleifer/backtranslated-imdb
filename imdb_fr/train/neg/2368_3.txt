Ok that's stupid, they say they do not make another Nightmare movie, it's the "last" ... And what are they doing? They continue to make another one, not that the next (part7) was BAD, but why they play us. Anyway, this movie had no meaning, it was extremely dull, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and it's even worse than parts 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a stupid tale in 3-D, useless! I mean. I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts I did not like, it's basically the whole movie. It's so different from the previous movie, he tries and tries, but this one tried the hardest and was slapped in the face. Again, there was no death scene, although they were different, they were really nil. How could they go so far? Did they not see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5. Yet they do it. That's all the money, DO NOT SEE THIS BAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE NIGHT SERIES. <br /> <br /> I gave ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS OF FILM: There was a potential with a plot. <br /> <br /> BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible act / lack of deaths / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
