Shiri Appleby is the sweetest incarnation of Buffy's nasty clone, Elle. But I'm ahead of myself, you see that Lilith was the first woman made by God as a companion of Adam. But she had all diabolical femininity, so God banished her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained as well) Lilith (now She) is free to become Buffy's clone mentioned above who has to fight with a crazy scientist who has received a blood injection from Lilith. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded ugly convoluted, it's because it is so. The film is also dull, generic, and for a film with a plot steeped in theology, he does not seem to know more. This ugly CGIed movie seems to be a failed pilot of the series. All I can say about the fact that he was not taken back is a resounding Amen. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Comment from author / director Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regina; and picture gallery; examples of video effects: before and after (it also has an "equally available" selection that you might think could lead you to movie trailers, but not to DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM supplements: final shooting script and transcription of deleted scenes in PDF format
