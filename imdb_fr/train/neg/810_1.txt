If you are one of those who find the TV show "Jim" great, it will change your world. And, let me add, congratulations for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all that you really need on a network other than ABC, which prefers to broadcast stories like Jim's Belushi, year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big thank you German Shepherd the size of a German Shepherd for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. This is exactly what fans of this film and little Belushi deserve. Jim's comic talents and his choice of projects are never far from his ability to break a blues standard. Look for him to showcase all his talent shortages in every project he launches to the public as a snarling chimpanzee in a zoo. <br /> <br /> If you like Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
