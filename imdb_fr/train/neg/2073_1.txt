Oh my God. Oh my god, I can not overcome this movie. It was awful. horrible terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cents trash. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I have ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First, G-girl? I hope you are joking. Real this looks like some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super women? I hope you are joking. It was so fake fake fake fake. The city's inhabitants did not even seem to care that a flying blonde was making her way through the city by saving a fire. Ohh Grand! <br /> <br /> Jesus, is it just me or did he do that the movie seems offensive? I guess what you have to be a superhero is a couple of double D's, blond hair, no glasses and a leather pantsuit ?! <br /> <br /> If it was to be romantic ... that .. my god, I do not know. It was horrible, if love means taking someone to an art show and making love in bed AND in the air ... when he was totally in love! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything was going too fast. First, this guy was single, he was dating G-girl ... they were separating as he was going out with this girl Hannah ... and ... it's going on. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me wonder .. How on earth did they see it in movie theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
