I shudder to think of what people must have thought of the environmentalists after watching this piece of domineering and predatory cinematic trash. Moored with enough knuckles and buffoonery in the space to refuel a new-age store, Starlight gives the impression that anyone who cares about the planet looks like an idiot dressed in crystal feathers. <br /> <br /> The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a model of underwear playing the flute in a mystical quest to avoid the near collapse of the Earth's environment. But they must first defeat an evil alien who looks nothing like a refugee from a bar in Castro Street. Fortunately, they have a mystical grandfather, Willie Nelson, who helps (who looks slightly embarrassed by the procedure, as it should be), as well as cheap F / X buckets and pieces of music swelling unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Of course, the clumsy scenario can hide the banal plot of the film and its breathtaking pace, but it is only the top of this melting iceberg. Everyone involved in this film should have their Union Card revoked until they have completed a real environmental science course.
