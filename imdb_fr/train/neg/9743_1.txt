With this line begins a silly and boring British science fiction movie. The great Vorelli of the movie "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation machine only to be cut off by Blanchard, a bearded man who loves bow ties and men with big eyebrows. When his experience fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself into Blanchard's house with the help of his charming laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, something is wrong and he ends up looking like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to the good orange haired doctor who walks around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are still other murders, some modest paper work and finally the doctor disappears where all the doctors face the rat go. Fortunately, no one has decided to make a sequel.
