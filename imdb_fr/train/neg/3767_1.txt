Budget actors, decent ... who knew that these things were important. Do not waste your time on this junk. The effects are shit. The acting game is shit. The only thing that could have made this even more bearable was a cheap T & A that would be wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only quality that even remotely buys this film is the very clumsy profanation. It was as if they had found the only 7 people on the planet to have never cursed before. Hat down! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in bad costume, go back to the old pictures of the prom. The only way for a Bigfoot movie to be good is to have a big budget and actors who do not come from the Frogballs community theater.
