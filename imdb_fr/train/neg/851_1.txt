After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I was expecting a lot of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was trying to be a movie. I have some main points to dislike this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson hardly fits in the character of Jack Torrence. Plus, I would NEVER choose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I photographed Wendy very differently. I can understand why they chose Jack Nicholson, his smile, his sharp eyebrows, but he is not supposed to look really "perverse". He is supposed to look normal and he is not doing well. In addition, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He acted like crazy. <br /> <br /> 2. The scenario They cut a lot of things that were in the book and added things. Some of the items in the book that I wanted to see in the movie were deleted, edited, or edited incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book that I could not wait to see (the animals on the hedge, the rubber mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 Â½ hours !! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack died of cold, Wendy was never hurt ... Overlook did not explode. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the film so upset him that I was stunned. Hallorann was not supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they want to kill him, at least ask Jack to use a rubbed mallet. You have never even seen a hammer rolled throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are other things I did not like in the movie, but there are things that are going well. The angels of the camera were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (it did not happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too angry that the movie did not go with the book, to try to be afraid at all. I recommend you read the book before watching this movie. I congratulate Stephen King for agreeing to sign a contract to no longer dispel Stanley Kubrik. I would never have done that, I would have taken all possible rights to shout at him all day. I can not wait to see the 6 o'clock version, at least it has hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
