I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is usual in all respects. Predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions of laughter, punctuate the nauseating and unimaginative intrigues of this mind-boggling mind to leave me physically sick or in a deep sleep more like that of an induced coma. But it could last a while longer, because it gives the average American a character to whom he can truly identify. An "ordinary" guy like you and I. I live in the southern United States. In front of the escape, this odious character is omnipresent, in one form or another. To see him on television is a brutal excess.
