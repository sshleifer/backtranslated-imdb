Drama manipulating a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway) raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - to whom she was introduced by her younger sister (interpreted by Sister Mariel), of which he is the music teacher. While the action in the central courtroom is attracting attention - largely thanks to Anne Bancroft's impressive performance as Hemingway's lawyer - the film is too often simply brilliant, but also extremely unconvincing: the jury ostensibly takes the musician's side because of the sensual nature of her profession and b) she did not oppose her alleged abuser when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple bedridden. What is the f ***?! she was clearly attached - what resistance could she realistically oppose? <br /> <br /> The second part of the film - involving the rape of the sister by Sarandon, curiously anticipating IRREVERSIBLE (2002) by performing in a tunnel - is quite artificial: the character of Mariel should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to his sister, but Margaux herself stupidly took up the work that had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The culminating point - in which Sarandon gets his fair desserts, Margaux suddenly turning into a fearless and resourceful vigilante - is however a pleasure for the crowd in the manner of DEATH WISH (1974); and Italian cinema mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the lives of the two sisters Hemingway took very different turns (this was the beginning of the film): Margaux's career has never taken off (despite its undeniable appearance and her laudable involvement here) - while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen's MANHATTAN and, interestingly, would play herself a glamorous victim of the raging "Playboy" violence Dorothy Stratten in STAR 80 by Bob Fosse (1983) With the added pressure of a few failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and eventually died of a drug overdose in 1996. Scary thing, the Hemingway family had a history of suicides - including the grandfather of the sisters, the famous writer Ernest, who died from a gunshot wound in 1961.
