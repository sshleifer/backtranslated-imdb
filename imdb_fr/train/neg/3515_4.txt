Basically, a propaganda film typical of the last good war. But there are a few things that struck me. The first was the use of epithets in the mouth. In two cases, Scott's character says one, one at first when he drops his bomb during the drop ("Dammit") and once when he tries to incite a bomber to become a pilot ("s *% t "). I could be wrong about the second instance, but I have replayed it several times and that's what it looks like. The third case is where the character of Anne Shirley wishes goodbye to the character O'Brien and good luck ("Give me a hell") over the roar of the engines. She must have thought it was too brutal because she clearly says "devil". I also found interesting the character who has moral problems with bombing, especially civilians. The unofficial superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit because of the viewfinder's accuracy. Given what we know about the late LeMay strategy of bombarding forgotten Japanese cities, this scene plays with a bit of irony. I remember McNamara quoting LeMay in "The Fog of War," saying that if the US did not win the conflict, he would be tried as a war criminal. The end is well overloaded, in agreement with the film. It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (I do not compare movies, but the end!). Maybe it's just because he's blowing himself up. Jump really well !!!
