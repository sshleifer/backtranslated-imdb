"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless movie that lurks among cable channels and takes up space like a tomato novel in the public library. A bit of worthless trip and a first effort for the mediocre director Seidelman, the film is heavy with bad actor, bad sound, bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the best movies never hit the market and the reason why unwanted movies like this disappear without ever seeming to disappear is one of the great mysteries of life. (RE-)
