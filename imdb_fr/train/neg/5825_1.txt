It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There were people coming out of the theater, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show) ... It's a meaningless movie, one of those that can to make sure that you never want to see an extraordinary image again. I would love to watch the filming of this film because I am deeply interested in what is happening in the head of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create all these ridiculous things or do they really think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is awful, except for some instrumental elements that remind you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The tiny tiny pieces of beautiful music are not a reason for you to go out and submit to this torture. God!...
