Now, here is a movie that, if it was made in Australia, would have easily been a comedy. Unfortunately and annoying, here it is flaccid and old and overcooked Lala. How did the director misunderstand? Well, mainly by taking such a hilarious job seriously that no one could take seriously. Unless of course it's a lonely and nerdy gay cliche (but somehow cute) ... or is it a cliché stacked on a cliché. No value in the story that almost looks like a GERY prequel of Gus Van Sant ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how is all this so heavy? Well, this author must've been so crazy about not seeing Burt and BOOGIE that he had to create his own. Convoluted and undeveloped, aside from the theme of "unrequited love, it's a nuisance" left by Streisand's faded lyrics, all that remains is the incredible scenario of beefcake and television series. The fourth necessary act of this drama prolonged drama is really terrible, because the film goes astray like the Gerries in the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz, in the late '90s, about twenty years made a similar but hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally shot as THE VENUS FACTORY, he also suffered from a more horrendous author than Orson. So they filmed half of the scene and got an unscrupulous TV editor to reduce it to 72 minutes and at the right time tonight! A lesson in that when the bad movies turn out good by lightening. I imagine that THE FLUFFER stiffened at the exit and after seeing it do not perform, I can understand why.
