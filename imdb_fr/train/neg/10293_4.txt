My wife and I watch a movie every night without distraction, and mostly artistic films that require reflection. I have a lot of patience for slow movies to flourish. My wife has double the attention I make. All that being said, this film is simply empty and boring! It was not going anywhere. Never blossomed. It started strong enough with a promising plot ... then she made biscuits ... went to Spain ... she sulks, she looks ... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We went through several long sequences of her looking in space. Artificial depth was involved when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully shot chicks movie claiming to be deep or artistic. You can never know or understand Morvern at all. About halfway, you do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop. Do not waste your time on it. I am shocked that he scores so high.
