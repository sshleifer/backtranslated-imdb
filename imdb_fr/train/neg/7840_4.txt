This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher from a Catholic school observing the RAWANDAN genocide unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. This brings us back to the story told through the eyes of a young idealist "newcomer", a young teacher who does not take life or situation too seriously. As he approaches a roadblock with the driver, he plays with his drivers, ID not realizing that it is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as belonging to the good tribe of the soldiers, he will be killed. And that's how he treats the story that unfolds in chaos and unfolds around him. He suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. Media cameras can not stop machetes, and there are too many armed militia to shoot. the title comes from the captain of the army, who announces that he will shoot at the dogs who eat the corpses around his enclosure, but that he does not want to shoot down the militiamen who kill people around the enclosure. Mainly because they have not fired on the soldiers yet. Finally, he realizes the desperation of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat to one of the intended victims is leaking with his tail between his legs rather than facing a death immanent with the children of the school. he promised not to leave. <br /> <br /> It's more a character study and a moment of encounter with Jesus for a character than the story of the genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie did not have to happen in RAWANDA, it could have happened any of the holes of hell genocidal circling this world at a given moment.
