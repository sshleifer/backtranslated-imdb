"Ambush" is not an ordinary action movie. It's way too bad to be ordinary. A man walks towards another with a machine gun on fire. The other man fires a shot and kills the man with the greatest firepower without perceiving a cut due to the rain of lead that falls on him. Guess which one is the right guy. Duh. Such is "Ambush" through and through. Not a good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambush" fails on all levels with its cast of veterans of movie B running mechanically, almost as if they knew that they were really losing themselves. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
