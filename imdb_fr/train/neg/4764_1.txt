86 minutes lost in my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say I'm not one to fall asleep at the movies. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a meaningless plot unfold in this way. forcibly, and can only assume that the actors were as hardened as the protagonist would have been in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adaptation is excessive. And if it's not wooden play, almost as if you could see the teleprompter, the decor itself, which is superimposed and interferes in a totally useless way, and dressed too unimaginably, is enough to make you forget all the stuffing. . <br /> <br /> Regarding the supposed shock of a detective in a disguise, anyone who does not see this - and the rest of this ridiculous plot - light years telegraphed in advance, should immediately check their eyesight. <br /> <br /> A bad acting game from two very honest actors, combined with the overdirection of Branagh's fabulous brand, is enough to make you want to use real balls rather than erase yourself. In addition to all that, there is a completely laughable nuance of homoeroticism in it, accentuated towards the end. All I can hope for is that it was such a failure that people are no longer trying to emulate this level of cinema.
