It is a film of tired clich√©s, but strangely infantile. Does a Nazi master wizard perform SF-related experiments in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> Aiming at a sense of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fear. Having no waiting in advance, I have left: an old Buffy Alex and a heroine with a monkey face who does not seem to know how to act. Adrienne Barbeau told me that I had never seen her before in the much more enjoyable movie "Cannibal Women in the Jungle of the Death of the Lawyer". <br /> <br /> The camera and editing add to the general impression of lame.
