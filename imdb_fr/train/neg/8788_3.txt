What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshing story manages to capture your interest from the beginning, then gradually lets you down more and more until you are left shaking your mystified head by the time it reaches its excess of conclusion. Unfortunately, that's what happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him come back again as the star of a new film, looking a bit crumpled perhaps, but still managed to give a strong performance and sincere. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (a new idea), and seems to have been contacted by her through this fun activity of electric fuzz that you see on your TV screen when nothing is broadcast. br /> <br /> The idea of ​​spirits communicating via waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and many people really believe in it, so I will not comment on what I think about it or about them . Let me just say that I am all in favor of suspending disbelief when it comes to buying fantastic movies like this, but what I can not tolerate is not to to understand what hell was supposed to be, that is, where I was left stranded when credits finally started rolling. A lot of static, indeed. <br /> <br /> Sometimes films like this make me completely perplexed, but if a film is not clear, I tend to think it's the filmmaker's fault, not the mine (unless I look at her when I was too tired to concentrate or anything else). Well, for WHITE NOISE, I was awake, my eyes were bright and my tail was bushy - so guess who's to blame?
