I have to tell you right now, I'm certainly not an authority on Bollywood movies and have seen only a handful. However, if you have never seen one, DO NOT start with this one! I loved those I saw up to this one, but I just could not stand it. I must also tell you from the beginning that I could not finish this film - it was also annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the movie. It's even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I never thought possible. It's so # @ ^! # Boring !! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was supposed to be a comical relief. Instead, he just pissed me off and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his smell - he did not seem to be silent and dominate all the scenes he was in - and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had the incredible ability to easily dodge AK-47 bullets. I'm not asking - there was a scene where several unarmed guys attacked a small army of guys with these assault rifles !! And again and again, they avoided taking a single ball AND beat the ruffians !!! That made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" banal !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so cursed, in your face and intense - it almost bleed my brain !! It was as if the film had been made by people under the influence of methamphetamine !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not take a movie with the plot and who wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters, their actions and motivations made no sense ... absolutely none! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're the most ardent action and Bollywood fan, you can stand this movie, but I can understand why he's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list . Wow ... this movie is bad AND intensely bad !!
