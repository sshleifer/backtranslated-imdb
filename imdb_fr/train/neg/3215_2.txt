The film has a nudity scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed with the genitals exposed smack dab in the middle of the screen. It's a long scene. What was the goal? I almost thought it was supposed to be funny, but we were looking at it with my mother and it was not funny to be IT looking at us for a minute that seemed complete. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. None of the characters are even friendly. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie. I was expecting it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director belonged to a French family very educated and educated and he despised these characters. <br /> <br />
