... and be disappointed bigger than ever. I will not make any direct reference or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic. If you are a trained soldier, do not worry about watching. I put it on the DVD with two friends who wanted to watch a somewhat interesting action / war movie. Why could not I first read the reviews? <br /> <br /> Already at the first scene "bomb", the film presents enormous problems, and they continue to appear and become bigger and bigger. My two friends, who are not related to the army, spotted one or two errors of the filmmaker almost as fast as me and asked if some of the things that were happening were realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film unless you are able to miss out on these completely silly and recurring mistakes. 2/10 for having attracted my interest in the beginning.
