There is not a hint of entertainment in this movie. There is not a scary, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. It looks like a horror, then called a comedy. It does not even stand up to humor. He does not try to be scary either. <br /> <br /> To avoid getting bored with this film, you have to be one of the most entertaining people in the world. If you like this movie, even a little bit that you do not have a standard for what you look at all. I have a hard time trying to figure out what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with that. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. So was it supposed to be a drama? Because it was really not dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too precious to lose 90 minutes to look at it.
