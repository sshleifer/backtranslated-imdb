Since I loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the '80s, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. In addition, the film could not interest me long. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Inspector Gadget, look at the cartoon instead. It was a lot better than the movie.
