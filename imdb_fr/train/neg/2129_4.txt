In my humble opinion, this version of the great comedy BDWY has only two goals - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But for me that's all there is. Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and it's no wonder that people walk on Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt who seems to prefer to be back on a Boston bar stool. . Jason Alexander is passable, but this wig must disappear and I saw better dancing at Bugsy Malone. As I said, it's good to have a version of the script, but I hope that young people, who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge them all based on that.
