... and how they bothered you! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the 70s classic BAD movies, made without any actors, with an embarrassing storyline, a sad direction and a relentless desire to melt "horror" with a light comedy. This film presents a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and devour the inhabitants of Crater Lake. Steve, our local sheriff, takes care of everything. Much of the film - without showing puddles of blood left by what we imagine must have been the beast to eat - is passed by the dumbness of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental. They try so much to be funny, we have lines like this, looking at a billboard, Mitch saying to Arnie: "You misspelled the bait, it's B-A-T-E." The laughs were rather rare here. We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy pay attention! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in the wrong way. And at the very least, the lake is beautiful.
