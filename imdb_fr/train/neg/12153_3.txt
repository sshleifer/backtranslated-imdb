Feeding The Masses was just another movie that was trying to earn some money thanks to the zombie craze, mainly because of the popularity of movies like Land of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a television station, which is guarded by the army, and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to containment and that the city will soon be free to do business . The problem is that this is totally wrong. Zombies are in full swing and only a small minority of people know it. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the cameraman, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the main presenter (who, for some reason, plays Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and Sherry refuse to lie to people, but the chain is run by secret services (or another government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film takes a pat on the back "We want to FEED THE MASSES to a level higher than the three films" of the dead "of George A. Rombero. The source of this quote has lost ALL credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean bad as I was expecting more (but I was obviously so), but I mean bad in that I could not find any quality that redeems in the movie, either. The game in all parts is either finished or too much wood. Did anyone remember their lines or did they read memo cards? I can not even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress. There really were not any. If I had to give a nod to someone, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but that does not really mean much. <br /> <br /> I should recommend to transmit this film. , despite the pretty cover of the box (that's what attracted me to the film). 3/10
