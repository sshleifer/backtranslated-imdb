It starts really well, nice intro and construction for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same mold as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without supporting the casting or an innovative storyline that has made Pie's films a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's game was rather mediocre. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best, but they did not have a lot of plot or scenario to put their teeth in. The film continues to run, without rhythm or logical scenario, which justifies its length. <br /> <br /> The end is about as predictable. as they are predictable - so predictably that I checked the spoilers box for that line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs if you really have nothing else to do / listen or watch and even then you will feel that the producers have just cheated you in an hour and a half of your life.
