This film deserved to work on Mystery Science Theater. Even if it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it's worth watching, because it's an involuntary laugh-riot. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters". Make sure to check out the following: the cheese medallion (it looks like the Shriners have been here), Norfolk's obviously polyester jacket on "Allan Quatermain", David MaCallum's ill-fitting stuttering in its worst role), the incredibly bad process works on all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the hand puppet that threatens the little girl, the giant snake that threatens Macallum as it sinks into flakes of oats, red eyes on motorized crabs, the incredible hilarious boat (oh, brother !!) that seems to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand drag and looks like a remnant of a Jr.Sr. prom ("Journey into the future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear imperial armor but inexplicably wear Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet to come!), and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with his scared wig) play smoochy-face-oh horror! The best thing is that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic French, and that the African - Snuffleupagus or whatever - has obviously chosen to die heroically rather than to be in other scenes.
