I can not stand this show! Has there ever been a single redemptive quality, a fun typing line or a plot that "did not" prompt the average viewer to drown in a bowl of soggy corn flakes? <br /> <br /> The voices. Oh, those horrible and miserable voices. As if we were repeatedly dragging a set of quality cutlery on a blackboard and dusty, each character is particularly annoying by his ability to voice acute and nasal. Cosmo looks like a whiny monster, Vicky, to a stereotypical shrew, and Timmy's dad resonates every line like a bad impersonation of a game show host (we think of Guy Smiley of "Sesame Street"). <br /> <br /> The animation is awful; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the extremely bad illustration of this show. Each character has prominent teeth, or a square head, or a head three times too big for his body. And what do the characters speak all the lines, wide-eyed and smiles, as if they were posing for a photo shoot with the president? Then there is the fact that every character in the series is completely stupid. Since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck's celebrity "Charles in Charge", no character has been portrayed as so stupid. Generally, "unrealistic" is synonymous with "not funny", and this is certainly the case here. Since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at that. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the series (and it's the same with every episode, the spoiler alarm here): Timmy wants something with his two "Fairly Oddparents", something is wrong there is always an artificial reason why he can not reverse his trajectory and wish to eliminate the damage and then everything goes well at the end. Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to use him on every occasion. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like a children's program with the subtle message that it's useless to say anything about an abusive babysitter is probably not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing an article and would like to give an example of how much the quality of cartoons has gone down, "The Fairly Odd Parents" should be a good starting point. A good example of the TV producers who together design a worthless product for kids that do little or no effort, just because they know someone, somewhere, is going to watch it.
