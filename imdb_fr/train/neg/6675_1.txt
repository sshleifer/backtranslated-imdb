This weekend just passed, I watched "28 weeks later", which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you it was one of the most boring horrors you can call. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script or plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the fighting scenes are lenient compared to a schoolyard fight. And to make matters worse, the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable dirty tongue that was diverting attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; instead, look 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
