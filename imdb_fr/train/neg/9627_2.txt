Okay, I love Ben Stiller, although I'm lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom in which I saw it is very hard to overcome. Looks like she's just reading the script. This film had only one advantage, and that is that Ben Stiller was there. This plot is so used and abused that it's ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot? Can we say "Forces of Nature ??" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before. It was a bother, but watching Stiller is always a delight !!!
