Someone here has compared this movie in some ways to High Noon. Now it's a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could have played that role would have been Don Knotts. First of all, as someone pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have the reputation of becoming a Western villain. He is just too light at this stage of his life. Maybe he was about the same height as Audie Murphy, but he had a solid build. Sinatra appears as the big little boy who speaks and no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is neither inspired nor truly credible. I do not want to ruin that, but I think that the end and the reaction of the townspeople in this story are meaningless. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely dominated by a "bad guy". This is just a small town, so I do not understand the attraction and I do not understand why people would let themselves be dominated this way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in the story and I followed it well. She was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so that another villain would not kill him. Now, there is true love for you. 'Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name to kill you! LOL. Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried this story, it had no logical way to go other than in the trash paper. . Want to know why it's not on video and never shown on TV? Critics had apparently refuted it in 1956. They were right. This movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid as low as possible to someone who has the most depth possible. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good western where a city stands in front of a villain? Try Tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint - two very, very good Westerns on this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer of all time - but you were not in a movie like this.
