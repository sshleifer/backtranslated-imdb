Why did I lose an hour and a half of my life watching this? Why this movie was even made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said that this movie had patience to watch and that it was not for everyone. I can not understand who this movie is for. maybe after dropping a piece of acid, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, could look at it and make sense of it. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's bullshit. The movie does not follow any plot, just when you think you have something, well ... you do not do it. <br /> <br /> I think that the end has brought an end to the film (no pun intended), the viewer has a glimpse of what could have happened. I do not think I put a spoiler here, not that it would matter. This film is another must in the world of cinema.
