It's absurd - apart from the Australian compatriot who edited this film, I can not help but think that all those who have already submitted a critique have been involved in the production of Elektra, given the generosity of their praise. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not really fond of converting comics into movies, so I did not have a lot of expectations, and yet I found Elektra incredibly disappointing. What annoyed me most was the fact that there was SO much in this unexplained film, which made you think, "How important is it to the plot?" or "how was this aspect of the character born?" I only hope that these things are perhaps a little explained in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this film seems to flip-flop random moments to match the scenario, and do not even get me started on the secondary plot completely useless. I also scratch (still) head in front of the fate of the character Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, which seems to have been unexplained. <br /> <br /> If I can congratulate this movie for anything, it will have These are the fantastic places in which it was shot, but otherwise, I did not have much fun with Elektra. I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for action / fantasy movies, but almost everything in this movie was so improbable or confusing (even against the standards of the action movie) that it just frustrated me. damn it, at least Jennifer Garner looks great.
