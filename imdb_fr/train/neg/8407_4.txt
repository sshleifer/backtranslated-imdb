Stunning travel storytelling with our poorly superimposed directors playing the role of narrators, the horrible false ears that transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants, through the total lack of logic, for the incessant Maureen O 'Sullivan moans of' Tarzan! Tarzan! ', There is nothing in this film that deserves a classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
