As a person who has read the novel and seen the movie, I have a different perspective on why the movie was such a failure. First, any comparison between novel and film is purely superficial. These are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably conceived as a satire, but it presents itself as a cross between tragedy and controversy. All comic elements, such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film's version, are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical project. And lest the ubiquitous white suit of the author deceives you into thinking it's another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the spectrum of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tail. Tom Wolfe is both a clown and a hack, more famous than the author, always looking for new ideas for his egocentric mill. <br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that the excellent skills in film production and production have been doomed to failure. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, the controversies are not based on universally accessible observations on one form or another of human behavior, but on a monstrous attack directed at specific people - real men of straw or fictitious - who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. Any attempt to create a successful filmed or narrative story from such a beginning must have its own beginning, free from any influence or interference of the writer. <br /> <br /> That being said, I also find that the cast is to blame. It's not just incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith who can not compete, but talents like Tom Hanks, Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either totally ruined or given roles that are just cartoons. <br /> There is enough news material here for a real movie satire, but she can not even get close.
