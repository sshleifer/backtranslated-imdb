Melissa's sixteenth birthday is imminent and she has just discovered her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys with whom she spends her time with all that he killed are murdered in this generic slasher of the 80s. It belongs to the sheriff of the city, Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch ), and her annoying mystery girl, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday, 13th part 3), to shed light on these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film and less on the murders themselves and is thus able to differentiate itself from many of its 80s Slasher brothers. It's hard for Alesia to have a great body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by indicating that the actress is over 18 and therefore to show that I am not excessively perverted). On the downside, the film is hindered by some plot points that are underdeveloped and useless, a complex theme that is used a little too often and an end that is a little anti-climate. But good wins over evil (barely). Give rent to that, but I will not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her breasts, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My Note: C <br /> <Red Code Supplements DVD: An intro of Aleisa star Shirley and Intruder Director Scott Spiegel; The cinematographic and cinematographic version of the director's film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; always gallery; theatrical trailer for this movie; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
