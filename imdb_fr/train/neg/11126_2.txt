Of all the movies I've seen, this one is almost in the background (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the bottom.). Of course, we have to drop some of it at the door of the author of the book. The book on which the film was shot is shockingly heavy and illogical. Oprah gives a nice appearance as a mother of "Bigger", but is not near her potential. Other famous artists also seem to be at their worst. The plot revolves around an African-American who decided to take a job as a driver. While driving the family's daughter to a communist dinner, he meets. One thing brings another and the girl gets drunk. Now, the family he works for is not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he gets home, he puts her to bed, but she starts to caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this and Bigger tries to silence her but chokes her. Fearing that he is in real trouble for having killed a white girl, he does what every logical thought man would do: he will push her into the charcoal oven. So the investigators take care of the case of a missing person and check the boiler (the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of ashes.) Desperate for a bad movie, this one could do the trick, but if you really want to educate yourself about culture issues of the 40s and 50s or see a good drama, there are much better options.
