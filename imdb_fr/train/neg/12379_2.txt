Based on the positive reviews above, we attended a free screening of this last night. Now, I know that filmmakers arouse positive reviews, because there is no way that an objective individual can write them. "Destined to become a" cult classic "" ?? The theater was crowded, apparently with the friends and families of the production team, as few of us had gone out early. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal I have ever heard in a musical. ?? "Do not take the short cut, honey, there is a wolf in the woods .." Debi Mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most tunes lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever plays the wolf in this story should be charming and seductive. Instead, we have Joey Fatone, ex-N'Syncer, at the height of his last name because he is not well old. He is not quite flexible with his overweight of 50 kilos and high-quality makeup in high school and his detuned songs. Seriously, this guy was in a vocal group? The other actors are half-sufficient, but can not do much about the unimaginative scenario. You know, it is possible to write at the same time for adults and children ?? see under "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the virtual sets were nice and well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash".
