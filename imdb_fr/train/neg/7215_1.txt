This movie was a stupid piece of shit. All bad. Why do we who love Western movies rent nine times out of ten when we rent Westerns? It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth playing with. Most of Shiloh Falls' main actions took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were models from the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad: in one scene, the marshal fanned his rifle to six shots about nine times and could not touch none of the three great men who are only twenty meters away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. Those who participated in this film might have taken lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
