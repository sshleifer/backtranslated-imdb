I can not believe that blockbuster is wearing this movie. It was so mean. I was totally fooled by the art of the box. DO NOT BE FOOLED !! It's not worth your time, I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews for this movie were a joke or what. I am so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not even match! The girl who made the voodoo on her is a stripper.The synopsis on the back says she has only 17 The people who write the description of the film even bother to watch it !? These positive reviews should be a joke.If anyone liked this film, then I lost all confidence in humanity. And I do not even get into the story about the title, or the fact that the whole movie was shot in two different places, or that the police did not even have almost any real uniforms Why would I even like "Who cares about cop uniforms!", Compared to the rest of the movie, the uniform was perfect. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans .
