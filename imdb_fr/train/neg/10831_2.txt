I guess this director / screenwriter had something to say. Let's see what it could have been ... a. Frog storms would be scary? b. Can I ask someone like Tom Cruise to say the word "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Throw my wife and have her say the word "F" every 2 seconds. Other than that, I liked the beginning and the storm of frogs. The rest was an excessive, indolent, too long failure (under-edited). Happy that many of you have enjoyed! <br /> <br />
