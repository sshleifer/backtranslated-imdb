I did not know if Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the hit movie "Malibu Express". With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris was a serious filmmaker and not a punctual director. The plot written by Sidaris, which has been unabashedly rejected by the Academy, is a complex scenario with many unprecedented twists and turns. The main characters composed work for a sex radio station called KSXY. Intelligently, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill", they face their long-time enemy, Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most prized diamonds. A well written script is not everything, the excellent acting of the actors contributes to make this film a cult classic. Sent by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in the years to come. It is now suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but it will undoubtedly be recognized in the future. I am disappointed that no circle of critics has recognized Andy Sidaris' trademark work. The costumes, the special effects complete this already magnificent film. You may want to ignore the disappointing score of this movie and rent it yourself. My personal note is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the Runaway Bride blockbuster and the action is better or equal to the Last Action Hero cinematic masterpiece. Andy, keep it up.
