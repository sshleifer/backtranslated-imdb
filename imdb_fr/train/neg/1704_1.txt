You would not expect a movie like this to be good, and that's not the case. It's an ultra-violent, budget-free zombie movie, filmed with a mediocre pocket camera ... and it's hilarious. The actors have obviously never played before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to see. The little plot I could find seems to be that a government experiment has eluded and a group of zombies seems to be terrorizing some families. The effects of blood are among the most disgusting I have ever seen. It seems that the goral effects of people attacked a butchery for all parts of the body, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and disgusting movie, and that's about all you can get from a movie. <br /> <br /> My note: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes
