Not a film, but a synchronized collection of actors' performances that were part of the British invasion, which followed the dynamic entry of the Beatles into the world of music. Some of these actions did not make much noise on this side of the pond, but many of them did. Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals and, of course, the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's so much fun to watch these young acts before they softened and polished their actions.
