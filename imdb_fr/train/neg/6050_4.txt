I just can not believe the number of people comparing this favorably to the first movie. It moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to take advantage of the success of the first film. The dialogue is appalling and has nothing else as authentic and convincing as the original movie. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, the representation of the French police is laughable and the incarnation of Doyle one kilometer from the first film. How many drug bosses do you think come down to the docks in person to see a cargo arrive? The ease with which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic. Like all the French police only drank coffee until Doyle arrived from America and did a real police job. What joke. Try to go to a foreign city and find the biggest crime in the region with a travel card and tourist flyers. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really terrible sequel, whoever thinks otherwise is crazy.
