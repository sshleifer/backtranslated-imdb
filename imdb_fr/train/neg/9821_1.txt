It's not often that I watch a film as appalling as this one. I kept looking, every minute in the hope that it was a joke, but only to discover that it was supposed to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as that kind asks. <br /> <br /> The acting was shameful and the situations were horribly artificial and clich√©d. If a film was shot in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord), we would think that cinema was so naive. It turns out that this film was shot in 2000 and I have not seen a film of the era of silence that has as little charm as this one. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for the serious viewer. <Br /> <br /> [Do not deserve a note]
