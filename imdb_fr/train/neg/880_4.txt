Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directing effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is a bit of a misunderstanding as a big casino owner who reunites his son (Robert Drivas, who looks suspiciously like Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: defensive, with a flea on the shoulder. Playing this cool and casual role is too much to ask Janssen, who barks everyone like a cranky husband (he even chews Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a clever man searching for his own identity, comments on the hip how young people despise Vegas (gives them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a lot of fun as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, "Where It At" does not have much to do apart from the now obsolete ruminations on ethics between adults and their children, a few quick headaches and brief satirical amusements about the world's high stakes. game ... most of which are now covered ad nauseum. ** from ****
