Oh, my brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for many years, all I can think about is Peggy Lee's old song. <br /> <br /> "Is that all there is?" ... I was only a young teenager when this smoked fish hit the United States. I was too young to go to the theater (although I managed to slip into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a projection in a local film museum made a sign - Finally, I could see this movie, except that I was as old as my parents when they went to bed to see him !! <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous time sands was because of the obscenity affair triggered by his release to the United States. Millions of people gathered around this newspaper, thinking to go see a sex movie ... Instead, they had a lot of big shots of disgusting Swedes and void, street interviews in tasteless shopping malls, a political claim ... and weak. who-cares simulated sex scenes with sagging, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, Holy Grail, historic artifact..anything else, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes into a lead box! <br /> <br /> Elite aesthetes are always scratching to find value in their boring pseudo-revolutionary pseudo-political speeches. But if there had not been the scandal of censorship, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythmic title "I Am Blank, Blank" has been tirelessly repeated for years as a titilation for porn movies (I'm Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I am curious, Black - for blaxploitation movies, etc.) and every ten years or so, the thing resurrects, to be seen by a new generation of cupping who want to see this "naughty sex movie" that the evolution of the film industry "... <br /> <br /> Yeesh, avoid like the plague..Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and move quickly to the" dirty "parts, just to finish with. < br /> <br />
