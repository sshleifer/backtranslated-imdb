First of all: I am not a conservative. And although I would never call myself a liberal or a democrat, I had opposed the war in Iraq from day one. I think it's safe to say that John Cusack and I would see politics mingle with reality. In fact, I'm sure we would become friends when we talk about the excellence of Adam Curtis' BBC documentation. My point is this: do not discredit this criticism by thinking that I'm not part of the choir that Cusack preaches in War, Inc. There is no doubt that WI's policy is designed to appeal to my demographics, but the The problem is: Sewing is substandard and the film that Cusack co-wrote, produced and produced is worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved had no doubt intended to make an anti-war movie just as biting and fun as Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer, they found themselves with a character as funny and unconnected as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and the "effort" of war is already absurd and, therefore, tragic, pathetic and, unfortunately, comical - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is that you can not write documents as funny as what the Bush administration provides us daily, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem of WI is that it feels that it is the case. set up quickly. To do this, Cusack essentially cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the scenery and piled into a shopping list of ideas from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas fall into your throat during the first twenty minutes of the film. What makes them so odious is that there are no jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons, and the US occupation of Iraq. , intelligent or funny. Writers are so blinded by their own dogma that they felt that by simply referring to these questions, the film would be funny and subversive. The problem is ... it's not. Right now, these ideas are the news of yesterday and, unless you have lived in rock or are blinded by ignorance, denial and pure stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian ), these jokes are of an unbearable simplicity. > Maybe WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and swollen with detailed research / insight into the occupation. In fact, jokes and visual gags are all superficial and so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did not make me moan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny because it's true" and The Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc., however, proves that it's not funny that this is true. In the end: it is not necessary to exert a hyperbole on American / neo-conservative politics ... it's already a pretty big joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
