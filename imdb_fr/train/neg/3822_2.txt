Being a Buster Keaton fan means having your heart broken regularly. Most of us meet for the first time Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films of his great period of independent production: "The General", "The Navigator", "Sherlock Jnr". We recognize him as the greatest figure in the history of movie comedy and we want to see more of his films. Here sorrow begins. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton's brother-in-law, Joseph Schenck, pushed him to sign a contract putting Keaton under the control of MGM. Keaton just became an extra actor to hire, interpreting someone else's scripts. Then his alcoholism got worse. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton never made a film of the highest quality. A couple of sources describe a comedy of masterpiece that Keaton claimed to have almost to do at the MGM: a parody of "Grand Hotel". Biographer Tom Dardis provided compelling evidence that Keaton had invented this story. <br /> <br /> Grief is growing because, among Keaton's many years of continuous decline, he has occasionally produced a good movie ... such as his short comedy 'Grand Slam Opera'. I continue to search for the lost images of Keaton's dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in "It's a Mad World": a sequence in which an embittered cop, Tracy, phones a retired old crook (Keaton) and tries to get help to steal money from Smiler Grogan. . These images have almost certainly gone forever, but I continue to search. <br /> <br /> "Speak Easily", alas, is one of Keaton's films since the beginning of its decline. MGM was trying to build Jimmy Durante (who was playing Smiler Grogan by chance three decades later) as a new star in comedy. Unfortunately, MGM tried to create Durante by associating it with Keaton, whose comedy style was simply incompatible with that of Durante. (I'm a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a ruthless thief of scenes: he was glad to know he was being built at the expense of Keaton, and Keaton was the only co-star that Durante had never tried to stage. . <br /> <br /> Keaton was often presented as the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In 'Speak Easily', he plays the role of a didactic and humorless teacher named Post (because he is as tough as a wood), who receives a letter informing him that he has inherited $ 750,000 , amount he has to go to New York to claim. Is he making a phone call to check that? Does he even check the postmark? No; he takes savings out of his life from the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he left, Post's servant confessed that he wrote the (fake) letter to Professor Post to jostle Professor Post from his rut! <br /> <br /> Post, who thinks to be a 3/4-millionaire, crosses the path of Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who tries to produce a musical review but has no money. The characters that these two brilliant comics play on the screen simply can not fit together. Keaton plays one of those group heads (like Mister Logic in "Viz") that all intellectualizes. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats that is unable to make a simple statement because the script requires him to always speak slang. Durante tries to talk to Keaton about money, but instead of talking about it directly, Durante has to use more and more artificial slang terms, such as "kale", "cartwheels", and so on. Although Keaton, of course, has no idea what Durante is saying. I want to thank Keaton: his own dry, dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, much slimmer and more handsome than he would be just a year later, is impressive as the excitable director of the bankrolled magazine (on tick) by Professor Post. Henry Armetta, whom I have never found funny, is even less funny than usual here, offering a running gag with a stupid gain. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more nasty version of the role she played in 'Horse Feathers'. Edward Brophy, one of my favorite actors, is lost. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Speak Easily" lies partly in the fact that the secondary characters behave in a totally inappropriate way. Keaton's lawyer shows up at Durante's theater with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he's not there, the lawyer decides to divulge Keaton's personal affairs to the first stranger he meets. (Fire this lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - the guy who seems to be funding this musical - blundering into the choir girls' locker room, and all the choir girls scream and cover up immediately . I know very well that * modern * choirs would never react in this way, and I seriously doubt that choirs in 1932 behaved in this way either ... certainly not in response to the "angel" controlling the strings of their series. <Br /> <br /> SPOILERS TO COME. About half an hour after the beginning of the film "Speak Easily", the great Jimmy Durante sits at the piano, smiles at the camera and makes the distinctive jolt of his head as he begins to play a melody. This is the moment when I thought that this film would finally settle in order to entertain us. Alas no. The most boring of all is the end of this film, which uses the most rebated and the most improbable clich√© of all the comedy: the one in which a completely incompetent dimwit becomes a comedian star by his own ineptitude. (Keaton would be forced to replay this shot in an episode of Screen Directors Playhouse in 1955, Chaplin had already used it in 'The Circus'. <br /> <br /> I almost cried - angry and sorrow - lost opportunities in "Speak Easily". Out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I will give 2 out of 10 points to this film. <br /> <br />
