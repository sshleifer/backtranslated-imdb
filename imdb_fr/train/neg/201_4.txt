Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this on a big screen? A lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, this could be your date film. But otherwise, an hour and a half is just too long. If you like to see skilled dancers on the big screen, it's better to see a Bollywood movie. They know how to combine a breathtaking dance with a long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to photograph the dance of experience. And from time to time, it looks really good. but when the movie is an hour and an hour, it should be interesting at least most of the time. There are many types of art, everything is not bigger than life and this movie is not too big.
