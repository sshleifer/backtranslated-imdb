The film is only worth watching if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in a bar and suggests that a good, fun story is coming. Well, I can tell you that it will not come. It will deteriorate in a few minutes in a film that will test your patience and your sense of shame for the actors, to a degree that you probably will not want to see. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of loss of identity which, according to him, constitutes the majority of the inhabitants of this globalized world. I was surprised to hear that. Do I live in the same world he lives in? OK, a lot of people are walking in the same clothes as me and listening to the same music and everything, but it does not give me the impression of losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Am I nearsighted or is it? <br /> <br /> Well my vote: the good start of the film prevents him from getting a decent 1, a 4 is my conclusion.
