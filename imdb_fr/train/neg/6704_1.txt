it's just a terrible "comedy" - it's really a bad movie. there are no fun elements. no jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people can claim that this sad short film could be "the smartest" or "quality". maybe if it's the only movie a person has seen, you can make that assertion of the brothers. but, I've seen thousands of better movies: namely Leonard's Part Six (now, it's funny)! I do not know how the brothers are considered eligible to appear on the Internet movie database: it's more of a personal video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Joke aside, ignore this movie. a root canal is more pleasant than this unusual clich√© material.
