It was great to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked really wonderful. But that was it. We did not give them characters or good lines to work with. I did not understand and care about what the characters were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small teammate roles. They showed talent and it's sad that they did not keep playing in better and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think Dorothy Stratten had the chance to play her only important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have a few fans, and I was very open-minded when I started to watch it. . I am a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his first Targets movies at "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I was barely able to stay awake watching this one. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where detectives and clients engage in a romantic relationship. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a hit TV series called "Moonlighting" stealing the idea of ​​history in Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was based on tons of spiritual dialogue, as it was trying to cope with a slapstick and a few lines of balls. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not no "Paper Moon" and only a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
