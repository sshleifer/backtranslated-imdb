This film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors did their best with limited material, but they could not go beyond the monstrous spirit of this bad movie. Jason Schwartzman was once again extremely annoying - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast was rather hectic. The scenes that should have been fun turned out to be disconcerting and incredibly juvenile. Try to be a Road Trip / American Pie but fail miserably at all levels. A total loss of time for everyone.
