As a fan of silent movies, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> As has been mentioned, the film seems to be a very long commercial for the Maxwell automobile. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the pursuit scene had lasted about half of its duration, I might have enjoyed the movie more. But he aged very quickly. And although I recognize that reality is often put to the test in the movies, without it diminishing the pleasure of the viewer, what about the Mexican bandits? I mean, they run after a car through the mountains, a car that moves mostly at about 1.5 km / h, but they can not catch up with it?
