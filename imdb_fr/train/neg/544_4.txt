Pros: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or does this guy still succeed in beating AB in their films together?). Some touching scenes in the 2nd half. <br /> <br /> AGAINST: All the first hour (the jokes were flat to say the least). Each scene involving Rajpal Yadav. A major stupidity in AB's decision-making. Let me understand, because he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in any way possible (which will probably spoil their relationship) is a better way for him to make sure that Ashhay finally assumes certain responsibilities, before telling him the truth. WTF? He thinks Akshaye is too sweet to bear the fact that his old father will soon die of cancer, but think that insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one not to see logic here? Easily the biggest defect of the film. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becoming a stuntman. LMAO !! We are told that he finished 1st in college each year and has a degree in MBA. But when the time comes to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How to really apply for a normal job in your field? Or heck, anywhere else where your life is not in danger? It's incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this kind of melodramatic shit. Everything is pushed in the throat to complain about the character of AB, which I could not. All this reminded me a bit too much Srk in the KHNH (which I hate). This "shit please sorry for the guy with the disease" has run its course. I wanted to vomit more than sympathy for the old man. I could not watch the last 20 minutes because of that and so I had to move quickly. all. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Waqt is too stupid to be called a good movie. Its obvious director, Vipul Shah, focused on the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who made fun of a story that makes sense. Give them images of decent songs, whimsical outfits, lots of glycerin-filled scenes and a little bit of star power.
