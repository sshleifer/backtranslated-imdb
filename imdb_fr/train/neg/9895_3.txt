If this book has remained true to the book, we can only assume that the author did not know the story. Mark Anthony never died of combat injuries as indicated. He died of a coward while committing suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose to kill himself instead. In the real story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great value of the slave and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed his own suicide attempt. He claimed Cleopatra and was taken home, in blood. She dragged her litter on ropes and Mark Anthony died soon after. If you want the story, do not watch this movie. If you want the romantic drivel, then you will probably appreciate it!
