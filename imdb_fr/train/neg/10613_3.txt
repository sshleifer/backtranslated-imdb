The dance was probably the only thing watchable about this movie - and even it was disappointing compared to other movies. My love! <br /> <br /> For me, it's the worst kind of film - the one that assumes it's a work of art, because it has all the characteristics of the film. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but it finally lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film is supposed to be surrounded. The tango is a tease, it's hot, it's drama, it's audacious - precisely what this movie is not.
