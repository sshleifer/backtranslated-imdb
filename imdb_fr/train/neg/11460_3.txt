A funny piece that tries to show how smart orcs are, but in the meantime (and quite unconscious for them), the audience feels stupid in making the most ridiculous movie ever. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman catching sharks for a living, but who is attracted to the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes wrong (do not ask), her companion (do not ask) goes wild (do not ask) and starts to SHOOT Captain Nolan (do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes they have something in common (do not ask). It's an amazing movie here. However, I must tell you that the beginning (with the whale sounds and nothing else) is quite haunting and the ending credits (with the most cursed song) is rather amusing.
