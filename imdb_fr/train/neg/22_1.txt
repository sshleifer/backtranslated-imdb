I saw this DVD at my friends' house and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood names. Interested enough, I decided to try it later. It was a hard experience to bear, believe me. Then, after having finally seen the credits, I said to myself: "We Turks, we are really worthless when making a film at the Hollywood.It is an insult to the kind of film hostage | " but wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, it was shot literally in America with a director and an American team! It made me think again! - How on earth can you persuade names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? with money probably .. That made me think further .. How can you raise such a sum of money to offer them and a so-called international distribution? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. By renting the equipment and crew the cheapest you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget, then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce - or vice versa, I have no information about it -. In the end, it's not a bad movie, because everyone is so eager to present it in the form of .. That makes you think - in my case, even meditate - and there are a lot of movies that do not do not even give that effect ... This one at least makes you think; That makes you dream .. That leaves you incredulous .. and then That makes you dream again ..
