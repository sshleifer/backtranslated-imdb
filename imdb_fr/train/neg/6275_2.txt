A very useless movie with characters who act in such an unfriendly way that I did not care who would be the best (or was it the purpose of the movie, to describe quiet and talkative people?)? No romance here, no comedy either. Playing is a very flat and very predictable scenario. What bothered me most is this constant joke with quotes from classic movies. Dude, do not you see that the more you quote, the less your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is not an excuse at all, nor a new director. Shit, shit, shit. No wonder it only costs me a dollar ...
