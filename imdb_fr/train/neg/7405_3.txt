I think they really let the quality of DVD production escape them. I rented this DVD in 2 movie shops and the second time I finally tried it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is very difficult to give the film an unbiased review after having had so much trouble playing it. On the one hand, I had never seen a Finnish horror film before, so I was a little disappointed that the film was shot in English. In addition, as nothing clearly indicates what is wrong with Sarah, she simply proved to be delayed and I really hoped that someone would shoot him in the head and remove all the horrible events.
