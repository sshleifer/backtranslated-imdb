Well, I do not think the photo is as bad as most critics say. . . but we can not deny that this poses problems. <br /> <br /> Generally, the problems are described in the script. There is a plot - but not a lot of history, and certainly not a plausible one; it trots an unlimited number of characters, lines, moments, things that you have strangely and / or stereotyped and ultimately, and in the end, it does not represent much in this department. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I do not care what "social evil" could try to solve; there will always be a group of people willing to do almost anything to shred their brains, even if it requires running around the cornfields to try to steal ammonia, or anything that these morons do. So, as a movie, you will not see me calling "Iowa" "important". But, stylistically, the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth's choices regarding the fact that a methamph√©tide head is head-shaped are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing, and - yes, I'm going to say - inspired. <BR/> <br /> The acting is uneven, but it could well be a victim of stylistic significance already praised. Listen, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but she's not very good here, so a discriminating member of the public has to ask, "What happened?" It's strange that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few actors can approach. For example, I could seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth might provide for Michael T. Weiss' tour de force as a probation officer, but I doubt that I ever buy it; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> Again, this is the most exciting moment and the moment John Savage appears in years. So, go understand. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that fascinates, but does not promise - and it does not matter; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. So, remains to see if Farnsworth has another film in him, but if he does, it is very likely that it will not be a folly. At a time when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of American Idol, we could perhaps allow, without contempt, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably defective film. <br /> <br /> What's more, we could perhaps congratulate ourselves on his energetic and sometimes fortunately idiosyncratic imagination.
