EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a new stealth fighter major escape at the detection not like the others. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to force the US government to pay it with a ransom. So they are forced to send their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To arrest him, in exchange for his release from a detention center where his mind was to be wiped out of all the incriminating information that he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I jumped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post-production alterations that had happened that it was shit and that all the negative reviews and the Low numbers of users were flocking, confirming what I thought. But I decided to try FOF because Shadow Man (from the same director) was not bad and, damn, Seagal was once my favorite actor and maybe he could still make a good movie. Oh what a fool I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, appalling archive footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, inexpensive production values, ludicrous and unconvincing battle scenes that have become Seagal's hallmark and boring A plot that goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his upcoming film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'm going to skip), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, not wanting anything of these terrible European action films and his next film, Prince of Pistols, could well be back in theaters. Damn it, he did it before and Stallone will have done it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> It's not a flight of fury. It's not even a moment of pleasure. It's a flight that can not even take off. *
