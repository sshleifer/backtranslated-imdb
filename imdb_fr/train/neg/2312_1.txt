This is one of those movies where I would have liked to stay at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is frankly boring. Which story is very fragile and you have to guess it. The film indulges in pretentious camera techniques that seem to have the intention of provoking migraines and giving it the impression of a student film. Have I already said that it was already boring? If all the characters died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not have cared, because I had no emotional attachment to them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but was about it. This is the first time that I plan to come out of a movie theater during a performance, but I always thought it needed to improve. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie with which you could threaten naughty kids.
