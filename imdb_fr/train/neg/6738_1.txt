There have been so many movies based on the same theme. only pretty girl needs handsome boy to impress ex, pays for it and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there is a bit of trial and error followed by a fight before everyone wears makeup before the happy ending ..... has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I knew it before I started to watch. But despite that, I was still waiting impatiently. In good hands, with a good cast and a brilliant script, it can always be a nice way to spend a few hours. <br /> <br /> It was none of that. <br /> <br /> this was disastrous. <br /> <br /> A female lacking charm or wit that has totally failed to ignite any spark in me. I really did not care if she "held her man" or remained single and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A leading man who, after some of his endless words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to remove that enough look. I did not know that leading a prostitute's life was the path to ubiquitous enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have a job, they all had more money than sense, a husband who continues his marriage after learning that his wife slept with his best friend .... more "I would miss you even if we had ever met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I'm losing even more time on this foam ..... I could complain about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh of the name "Woody" but in truth it was the only thing of distant humor that happened in the movie.
