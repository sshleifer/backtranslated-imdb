The overheated plot of "Hello sadness" is taken from a first novel young Francoise Sagan, become best-seller, although God knows why. For teens who wish to get rid of a potential step-parent, this may have some appeal. Do not be taken into account by the fact that David Niven plays the father of the playboy and Deborah Kerr the mother-in-law. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She is beautiful and easily fills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can take poses but can not act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in St. Joan of Otto Preminger - Seberg's first film - knows that she was unable at 19 to make a film. This film, also from Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was his second film; she was now 20 years old. What was Preminger thinking? What could Niven and Kerr compensate for Seberg's lack of capacity to act? No chance? The character of Seberg is at the center of the story and, as pretty as she is, convincing that she can be physically at 17, she can not satisfy the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she became a successful actress in her short life because she did not impact my consciousness in her subsequent photos. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste test. Despite Niven and Kerr, it remains a juvenile story performed juvenely by a beautiful girl who badly needed theater.
