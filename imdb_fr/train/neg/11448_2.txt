This film is by no means as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it was not funny. He could not stick to a type of comedy - he went from SNL to Adam Sandler - to romanticism, to the little guy branding a lot, to slapstick, to the type of comedies "Loser" (the movie). Although there were some weird moments (falling down the hill), no one was particularly funny or remarkable in any way. The "Schindler List" was funnier (and seemed shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, dropping out of school or just as a loser living at home with his mother, Sissy Spacek, in her worst role choices. And poor Ian McShane, The serious actor if I had only to name one, is pissed off to read on camera. The story lags and is completely predictable until the end including (no problem here in case Adam Samberg's mother wants to see her). Do not spend money to watch this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will understand and start producing quality movies (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
