OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or Good is either crazy, or knows the director, the screenwriter and the producers and tries to reinforce the buzz about this movie. I watched the movie because one of my friends worked on it and it was horrible. I am an actress and I have been working in the industry for some time already on great movies and even freelancers. This film bored me to tears. The reason I'm so tough is because this movie was clearly a different version of "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's such a scam of history. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be bankrupt in terms of creativity ... the fact of taking a classic book and the movie "Of Mice and Men" and destroying it with a new rotation makes me so stupid. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the staging were amateurish and the writing gloomy. I mean, if you're thinking of modifying an existing story, make sure it's just as good or better than the original so that the new version is justified. Did not like this movie at all.
