On a distant planet, a psychopath is saved from execution by a monk from outer space. He releases a few fellow prisoners and leaves the prison in a spaceship. They dock on a ridiculously huge spacecraft that revolves around a supernova star. This massive craft is populated only by three people, probably because the budget of the film did not provide for the hiring of many actors. Anyway, to summarize, the three gifts are found in a game of cat and mouse with the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The psychopath of this film is curious to see that it is annoying. "Annoying" is not usually a term that could be used to describe an insane person - incongruous, scary, dangerous, perhaps, but not "annoying", but it is. The three people aboard the giant ship are hardly convincing, because they confer roles as important: this ship is almost the size of a city! Given that the film takes place in about 50 years, it is somewhat optimistic that such a craft can exist, not to mention the fact that it is used for such a trivial task. Despite the towering size of the spacecraft, the crew has all been terribly outfitted, small rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty well played and works like a sci-fi thriller. But nothing good.
