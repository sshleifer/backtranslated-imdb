This film is a calculated attempt to cash in on the success of Sex in the City and four weddings and funerals. In fact, if they had called it Sex at a funeral, they might have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can not get up. The characters emerge from an incredibly bright dialogue, but never act in such a hitherto unrecognizable way as a human being. An arbitrary and senseless action succeeds one another to advance what is happening for a plot, and one quickly tires of the falseness of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for playing her little heart, but the honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, like anything, a police detective (do not they have a height requirement over there?). Mrs. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. If we could say the same of the screenwriter-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill annoyed you like a fake, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.
