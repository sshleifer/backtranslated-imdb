I sat in front of this turkey because I had not seen it before and because the premise seemed to have potential. It was slightly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind blows hard enough to blow up the windows of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly straight and no leaves are moving! In fact, when the characters move outside the house, the sunlight is visible and illuminates the treetops. At that time, regardless of the credibility of the filmmakers, it had evaporated faster than the very localized rain of their film. Too bad that not all hurricanes are like this, it would surely help our homeowners get insurance rates here in the Sunshine State.
