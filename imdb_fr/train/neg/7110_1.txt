Well, we must congratulate the director for his courage. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total cast of five people (no extras at all), but he also decided to use mediocre special effects with a confusing and boring conspiracy. beginning of the movie you could die of fear !!! However, they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFIIIIINNNNNNN. Having a scary limping gardener is always a good shot. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you look at Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen that already. They like to present horrible movies, just to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good present for someone you hate.
