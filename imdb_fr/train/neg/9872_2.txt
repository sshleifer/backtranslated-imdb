Hard to believe that the film of this book could succeed in overcoming its horror! The plot is so artificial and incredible. . . begin by imposing extreme guilt on a small child to spare him the pain! Then we have the complicit behavior of at least six and perhaps more people (including the clergy) involved in what is a crime all over the world. We then have a woman who, apparently, in the length of a ferry crossing, goes from relatively happy to very soon banging on the tracks. A very unpleasant mother and coo coo, helped, encouraged and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, although it helped the filmmakers' budget. The beautiful buildings that were supposed to house the monastery did not seem logically fit for an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, whom I really like, is extremely thin in this film and her hairstyle certainly has a place in another decade. Plus, there is simply no chemistry between her and one of the men. I really did not like the book from which it was taken, but I read it all. The film on which I surfed constantly had to leave whenever the saccharine music became too heavy. Unless you love an incredible story, a wooden acting game, a distorted mix of religion / mythology / allegory, my advice is to skip this step. Oh, and maybe a little criticism, but would not a caring father have a lifejacket for a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the decor
