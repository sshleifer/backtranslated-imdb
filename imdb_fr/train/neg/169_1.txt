I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it from New York. After 30 minutes, I said, "Are you kidding, is that a joke?" He thought it was good. I told him I thought it was probably one of the most stupid movies ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda film made for children?" The plot is stupid. The acting game is the worst for most directors and people who look at this kind of guts and think that it has something to do with life, love or even afterlife, which it offers a view unbelievably stupid ... need psychiatric help Help me. Please, if someone tries to make you stick this in your DVD or video player, consider it as a virus introduced into your computer ... it will not destroy your player, but your party will be destroyed. If they had made Razzies in the 40s, they would have won in all categories. (PS He also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "Stairway to Heaven".)
