First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this budget zero film is not one! The image quality is so thin, the soundtrack is the most annoying I've ever heard (!!!!), and as far as FX effects are concerned ... well, the extremely low quality makes it sound less healthy some. in a real movie (what this junk here is not). No concept, a thin script, a primitive action game and a rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each repeated about 20 times ... likewise for many movie sequences (maybe to be an indication for what kind of public this shit was made !!!) The story seems to be that of a young boy who had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, suffered psychological damage and, at the adulthood, touring with a self-injury show. So far, so good ... But for these idiotic pseudo-craftsmen, this plot is just a line to put in rows cheap shock scenes that have neither message nor meaning (the newly released entrails are thrown on a naked woman, tied up in a hole in the earth ... why ... and why is this the only time you see both a woman and a thrower in the bloody "movie"? Worrying? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO!!!!! Everyone who takes this cheap gore-art show should go to their psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar subject can be treated in a clever way ... last film (! !!!!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all your heads over there, remember: anything that looks cheap and makes no sense makes no sense, it's automatically "Art" ...
