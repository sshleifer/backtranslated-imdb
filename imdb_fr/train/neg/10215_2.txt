A horribly useless film and, worse, boring. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most unimaginable stereotypes and relies on a clumsy central concept that is neither particularly original nor treated in a vaguely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is totally lost in what he was hoping to be his response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replaces his usual screaming routine (albeit very funny if you neglect Talledega Nights), well, almost nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is no more than slightly irritating (some critics I read here claim her for an Oscar nomination is laughable) while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a fair job with a very weak that allows Nothing but being a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because she loved to make people happy. Please. That she ended up falling for the "character" of Ferrell is quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to brighten up the film by using computer-generated images only highlight the insufficient material with which he has to work. <Br /> <br /> I had the choice to go to The Prestige for the third time or see that. I would have liked to have opted for the Prestige.
