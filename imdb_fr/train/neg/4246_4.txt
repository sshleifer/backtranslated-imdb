Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate Greta Garbo, a former movie star, and present them before she finally leaves. Perhaps it would have been called "Bancroft Talks" while the actress attacked this uncertain material of comedy / drama / sentimental throughout its duration. The director, hot or cold, Sidney Lumet fails to get a consistent pace, and the filmmaker has no intention of doing too much with Bancroft. He keeps it in the foreground: cute, tearful and ravaged. Estelle becomes a brake on this scenario (not that the plot with the slim design still has a lot to do). Silver and the other stars, Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks, have little more to do, is to support the star and everyone is trampled by his hammer. * 1/2 of ****
