The film resumes after the remake of last year with the installation by the army of electronic monitoring equipment in the desert where the attacks of the first film took place. The crew is killed shortly before a group of soldiers taking part in a training exercise shows up to find no one around them. You can complete the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a paycheck picture all around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performance, nor in those behind the camera. It's a movie that was made for the money and nothing else. At one level, it should have worked, it could have been a more horrible Southern Comfort (where National Guards are running against some people in the marsh), but on the contrary, it's not much. In large part, you can blame the script, incredibly written in part by Wes Craven, who strikes again and again the same old goals. Add to the disorder the fact that the direction is bland and the setting up of the sequences is so little gloss that any tension inherent in a scene will be suppressed. <br /> <br /> It's not bad as such, but poorly done and dull. Let me put my feelings in context: the reason I saw this movie was that a local multiplex had ruined and filmed this movie instead of The Last Mimzy children's movie and I wanted to see what had caused the scream (the movies have a lot in common, he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this film will only scare those who love the latest Mimzy.
