I really have to watch a good movie soon, because it seems to me that every entry on two is something that I despise. However, my story speaks, I must not lie. Bobby Deerfield and all that concerns him sucks big skins of green bananas. I never thought I would see a movie as resounding as this one. Al Pacino does not act in this film: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a racing car driver, just looking at the camera. He is absolutely awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love story and there is simply no chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is it the same man that I have acclaimed in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible cinematic experience. Run, do not walk, far from Bobby Deerfield.
