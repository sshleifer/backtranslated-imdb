I repeat: this film was totally nil. Children will love, certainly, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was fundamentally a redesign of the original, which we could have expected, since they explored the concept in its entirety in the first film, but did they have to redo the film completely? I mean, everything is redone from the Little Mermaid. The worst is Morgana "Ursula's crazy sister" who comes out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the plot told him to do nothing. I could go on, but I will not do it. All of this is a shameless attempt to make more money from the Little Mermaid and was thrown together without thinking because they knew it would sell. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
