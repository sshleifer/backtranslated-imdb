This film does not contain humor for anyone who has lived with a family member with a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the male version of "Mommy Dearest". It describes both the lives of many children with parents who have mental illnesses graphically and accurately. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act as if he were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. Not at all, I say! At best, it's sick humor. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what our families actually live.
