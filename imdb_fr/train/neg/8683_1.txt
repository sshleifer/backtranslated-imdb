This show is not smart. That's basically what it comes down to. The "original humor" that these authors are attempting to remove to avoid completely biting the rest of the bush hunt in the world is simply ridiculous. In another comment, someone quotes some hilarious lines. George H.W was my star. Bush tells the kids that they are not supposed to watch TV outside of Fox News. Sensational. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this series is a highlight for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with drivel as this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are starting a second season. I am a liberal Republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this is not an excuse to eliminate this waste of such depressing time. I place these writers at the same level as the geniuses of "Meet the Spartans". Their formula allows them to host as many topical jokes as you already can and add original material to allow you to credit yourself. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Unfunny, and it makes me more and more unhappy that this crap like this one is renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are put in box after 3 solid seasons. Please, do not look at this shit, unless you are one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think that any sentence with the words Bush and Dumb is comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice is nil. All he does is slightly imitate a Texan accent and expire very loudly at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits the voices are not accurate. If you want a fun political satire, watch Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, as the animation of the stop motion action figure is EXTREMELY well done. Look for George Bush as a Jedi on YouTube.
