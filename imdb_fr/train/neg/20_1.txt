This movie was terrible. At first, I just read the summary of the plot and it looked OK, so I watched it. The acting game was terrible. it was as if the actor was almost shy in front of the camera. everything seemed wrong. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> the plot was also a shit. the writers were probably deprived of sleep when they found the lines. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you continue to watch just to see how much worse it might be, so that you can later tell others how you can not believe how bad the movie is. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch this, so that we can better appreciate other movies, REAL.
