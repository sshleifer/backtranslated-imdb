Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director did not manage to put this in place. There is a lot of action, a lot of promise, but everything comes from Hokey. The director did not do his job. A promising action is deteriorating. So much seems artificial in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV attributes this to 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch. Another director would have done a better job.
