Having appreciated Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was taken to its maximum. So I tried to miss this second-place ball game about an investigation into the death of a jockey - but I did not go all the way. Arthur, photographed in the manner of a movie magazine, wants either alimony from his ex-husband, William Powell, or another blow to the wedding, but I never cared for her because the character is not that a chain of sarcasm (comic curiosity, but once in a morgue - like all women in these comedies of the 30s - she faints). William Powell would have spent a lot of time working with Miss Arthur, but you would never know by the end result; they look clumsy, one next to the other, hesitant about their jokes. The actor playing Powell's valet is atrocious, and the spectators' pauses for laughter are full of anxiety.
