Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, his thick writing, and Harrison Ford in a cop-cop comedy! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid and use at best 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> The mates-cop movies are fun. However, their true golden age goes back to the 1980s and 1990s. Doing the one that mixes action and comedy through the Hollywood font is a good idea, but the end result turned out not to be at home. less a parody of the subgenus, but a reason to ask God to show mercy to all. past films of the same genre while the worst of them was undoubtedly superior to (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What happened to this fun formula ?! For a decade, things are not the same anymore. You would have a stubborn flop of buddy action after another. I will delight you with a few titles to seize the disaster: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them to date . (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I think one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many movies and similar TV shows over the past two decades. Add to that, especially here, neglect and monotonous humor. In fact, the problem is totally unbearable this time. Yes, we have the characters of 2 faithful policemen who have a second job and the context of the sinful city, but what else was new ?! It's not about cliché; It is a question of few renewals mingled with clichés where both were badly made. <br /> <br /> The acting game, especially on (Hartnett's) side, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor!). So, his character wanted revenge for the death of his father! Revenge against you guy, it's probably dead to watch your game !! Even small roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they seemed anyway here!). <br /> <br /> The staging fails to present something comical or hard, some parts have managed to be very dull (stop the black by lack ??); It's a rare moment to be boring in what is supposed to be action / comedy! They did not use Hollywood itself, nor as an ironic place where there is a dirty mouth behind the superficial charm, nor even as a place full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could have given him some interesting moments ). <BR /> <br /> It's a very easy film that says it could only be seen through the glamor of its stars, and it was a flop-flop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself! Guess who ?!), and a destroyer Buddy-Cop more only a movie! My God, do not let my children and I live enough to be witnesses (Hollywood Homicide Part 2)! Finally, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we did not do it.
