This film started really well. It had the potential to turn into a very heartbreaking and romantic love story with a cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be anything else, and for a moment, I was excited by the fact that someone was finally making a beautiful film for himself, another timeless classic, a modern myth perhaps. Why, oh why, then ruin it halfway by making the main character (Norton) another psychopath? Maybe I miss the point, but do we really need another movie about psychos? Or does this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicate a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment, I was going to mentally record the director's name; now I feel indifferent. At least, it would be necessary to add in the defense of the film that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. In addition, Evan Rachel Wood is really beautiful to watch and a good actress with a lot of potential.
