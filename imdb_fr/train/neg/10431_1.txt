I loved the first season. The quality dropped a little during the second season, which had a good environment (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original and was OK. The fourth season started to tumble quickly because they never even started to explain to us when we really needed it. What was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was Angel-Kara's goal to lead the fleet to a devastated Land-1? What kind of past did the last five Cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnated? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, ok. But destroy the fleet ?! Abandon technology and abandon all forms of urban life, and spread a sheet of paper on a few thousand people all over the planet! It's not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is imprisoned for ever in a cycle from the romanticism of nature to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive weapons that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a greater future for humanity, and it is the antithesis of science fiction proper. And do not even throw me on the angels! Claptrap religious of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment !! <br /> <br /> The whole "all this has happened and will happen again" should have been linked to the previous incarnation of the series, and not only to the Earth as we know it. Making the new show consistent with the old would have been the ultimate genius. Frakkin ashamed. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
