Let's start with the good side: Swayze speaks Zulu several times to his friends or this language is heard among the tribes. This is a huge advantage, as moviegoers in the United States and the United Kingdom usually think that everyone on this planet speaks English (just in case you are one: no, they do not know it). <br /> <br /> tenenkrommend, as they say in the Netherlands (it makes your toes shudder - and not in a good way). I love Swayze but in that he is awful. The muscles in his jaw are working overtime and he's frowning at the whole movie - some have had to tell him that sounds silly. No Patrick: It sounds silly and it's a compensation for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for a style of play that does not match that of her colleagues. His playing is so relaxed that this film could have been shot nowadays. And it's not. Your dress was a hint, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best acting game came from the people of Africa and Onyulo Sided as Umbopa pleased me the most. Clear, warm and with character, her performance is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> General: It's about entertaining a rainy day. Pity. Could have been better. Sack the director.
