[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this movie precedes it, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in a mailbox on TCM. What a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and the production values ​​are top notch, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and the whole takes too long. For a film that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and cliché. One example is the portrait of Frank Hirsch's infidelity: his rather severe request to his wife to "get up a bit and relax a bit" followed by his predictable supplication of a headache, leads - even more predictably - his evening liaison with his secretary ("Hey Nancy, I have the blues tonight, let's go for a ride"), all this in a worn out formula. We do not think that they are real people, but cardboard cuttings acting in a puppet theater play. In addition, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never really been explored or explained. Dave's craze for Gwen is inexplicable in the light of his ruthless inability to go to bed or leave the potty. His subsequent marriage of despair with Shirley Maclaine / Ginny's character is, from the moment it is presented to this viewer, anyway doomed to failure, and it was clear - according to the conventions of this type of soap opera - it could only be resolved by someone to be killed. By the time the jealous lover started running with the gun, I started to bet with myself as to who - Dave or Ginny - would be killed. Everything was wrong with a capital "P". <br /> <br /> That said, the performances of Maclaine and Dean Martin are remarkable. But overall, I find that the interest of the film is purely that of a piece of Hollywood history.
