Robert Colombus has two full-time jobs. He is known worldwide as a world-renowned television journalist. His exploits as a full-time regular runner are less known but equally difficult. <br /> <br /> I saw "Live for Life" dubbed in English under the title "Live for Life". A little life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: a departing mistress, one entering, and the woman cheated at home. This helps Robert be a casual liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "my work has taken longer than expected". He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for the succession of his connections. You wonder when this guy will be caught with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some people can find their life exciting, but I found it tedious. His companions, including his wife Catherine, are attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and so misleading that you wonder if he appreciates all that. <br /> <br /> Adding to boredom is a huge film that does not advance the plot. There are extended sections without dialogue or dialogue only in French. We see documentaries about wars, torture and troop training interspersed with live scenes. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we will wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is the most remarkable performer of this film. Her was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen early in her career. I can not fault Yves Montand's performance on what was basically an amoral tramp. <br /> <br /> I appreciated some of Claude Lelouch's innovative techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera walks around the room while Robert and his mistress argue. We see them briefly with each passage in the room. In another scene in the sleeping car of a train, Robert is lying on the upper bunk, while his wife is on the lower bench. Robert gives his wife important but disturbing news, but we only hear part of it because of the noise of the train. I felt that his wife was also unable to absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of these scenes and those of Amsterdam was superb. <br /> <br /> I examined this film as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I named the project FIFTY: 50 remarkable films forgotten in 50 years. As far as I know, this film, like the other forty-nine that I have identified, has not been on video, broadcast or distributed in the United States since its original release. In my opinion, it is worthy of being made available again. <br /> <br />
