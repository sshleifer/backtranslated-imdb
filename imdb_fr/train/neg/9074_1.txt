Yet another adventure in the world of teen comedy, set up on a college campus, featuring a nerdy in search of self-control, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks to make him take the girl . All this has been done before and all this in a much more satisfactory way. The rude humor that has made teen movies such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my Car" so popular is completely taken out of context in this episode, appearing so randomly that the viewer can only disapprove and disapprove. The film is poorly written, and the actors never manage to make it even slightly bearable. I'm not even worthy of this terrible image by disclosing because it's a waste of time and your time. At best, slackers never manage to entertain or laugh, and at worst, they are terribly bad and sometimes quite unstoppable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed during his debut with Rushmore, humbles himself by appearing on this picture. One wonders how a career can end so quickly in the bathroom. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
