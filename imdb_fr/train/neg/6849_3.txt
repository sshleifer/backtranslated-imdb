This horror film, almost J, was about a young woman returning to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell the family home and meet old friends. She finds this one, the daughter of the priestess of the village, drowned several years ago. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already, the bonds between the dead and the living are weakening and friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good in this film. Unlike stellar horror movies in J, the suspense does not really rise, the result does not seem too threatening and the end borders on the absurd. <br /> <br /> This film looks like white rice cooked a little too long cooked so that it is almost pasty. Sometimes you receive it in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost completely ruins the meal because of the slimy, slimy taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
