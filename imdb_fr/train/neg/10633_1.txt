I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The cover of the video features a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The film begins with several rocket fire clips, most of which are unrelated to human flight. The smoking gun of Sibrel is a short video clip of astronauts preparing a video show. He edits in his own voice off instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video ends curiously with a projection of the film Zapruder. His claims about radiation, armor, star and other photography make me think he's extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to defeat against NASA, astronauts, or America in general. . His science is bad, just like this video.
