I really hate this show! I watched an episode and I knew that this show was really terrible. The stories are both badly written and poorly executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean it's just a scam of Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, about a hateful boy with blond hair and flambé with his twin sisters of genius and talking dog; a father who stays at home and a smart and super-busy mom ... Like oh-my-flippin'-God! Their father is a crazy house designer, a mother-mother, is not it so gay? If my father is at home, I would die personally! Shame that is ... Really I would do it. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to do about it ... this parody but only 3 words; count them in 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Blade, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say, it's definitely my list of the worst EV-ER animated series! If I had one.
