This film is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. What people have forgotten is that the reason the original movie was so successful was because it was supposed to make you incomplete. <br /> <br /> This film makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a type of negative guy, but the man's role in this movie is .... without comment. The plot was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I'm sorry for having had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this movie. I still like the original and I will do my best to make sure that this film does not spoil my opinion about it.
