It's definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed that they were trying too hard to play their roles as dorks, badass, assholes, know everything, and so on. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. It seemed like a kind of computer-generated image at the time of Atari & Intellivision. At one point, towards the end of the film, as an army of sasquatches pursued the survivors, one of them was shot and as it unfolded, it looked like the donkey version kong of a poor man! And we are hit by a bullet and the blood coming out of it was just a frightful animation. Another thing that was boring was the music. Too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It was endless. Oh yes, the movie is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spend it in a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. REALLY AWFUL!
