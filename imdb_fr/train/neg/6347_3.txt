I will probably always see a Woody Alleb movie, because you never know when he could really make a comeback to his past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines might be worth it. Unfortunately, this film has no success. To say that it makes me really sad and even a bit guilty. I'm sure my reaction is very similar to many other Woody fans, but what can you say? It is probably time for him to focus on his Clarinett which, in my opinion, is pretty good. By saying all this, I will probably go into any new movie that Woody could release in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect The WOODY !!
