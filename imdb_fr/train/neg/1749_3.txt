I must say that it was the worst priyadarshan movie (with a better director, kyonki, which was also his director's project), it does not contain any particular scenario and focuses only on the presentation of the body by novice actresses and some stupid comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy films, just as Govinda and David Dhavan did in the past, after giving to good animators, they also lost their audience.So it would be good if he focuses more on the scenario and try some variations in its direction. Give us more weekly herapheri and malamal rather than giving duds like garam masala!
