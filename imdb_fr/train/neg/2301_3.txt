Does anyone think this show really helps some people, or does it only anger people who watch it? When I am flipping through the canals and come to this show, I am half attentive by morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all at once. What I do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson is of little importance. he is an old man who thinks in an old way. the fear of damnation no longer has the same effects as in the past (thank God). Now, if someone will answer my question, I will avoid lightning for the rest of eternity.
