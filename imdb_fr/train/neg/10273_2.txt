As far as horror films are concerned, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore lower-than-normal production values, and ignore intrigues in the interest of good fear. This film just does not have good fears to offer. We can not even enjoy it in camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the fighting was predictable and poorly organized, the music was annoying, the work of the camera was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with a terrible and artificial dialogue and a clear lack of direction. I doubt they had a repeat either. It's embarrassing to watch and so boring that surviving the artificial end "surprise" requires considerable endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not normally write reviews, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This film is a total waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making of" franchise. The writer / director seems to have the impression that turning the murderer into a woman was rather bold and daring. (He saw it.) He spent half an hour with the cast deconstructing this film as if it were a "Kane citizen" of the new age. It's like listening to a group of third-year students take you behind the scenes of their Christmas show. They really think they have created something substantial. It's sad, really ?? The only reason I gave the movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So, "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the last 50.
