After watching FIVE THROUGH EYES, I must be honest ... I just did not like it. I had read so many good reviews about this movie, but I just did not understand where these reviews came from, <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for newcomers to making movies, and I'm sure directors will do well, but the budget they had was the main problem. Two cameras were used throughout the movie (which was OK), but they seemed to be really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you have all these girls screaming and screaming at the same time, talking all over each other - it's impossible to hear what they're saying. <br /> <br /> good idea, in short, they hit a parked car, then left, a little later, they are pursued by the car they hit, driven by a crazy woman, who wants kill them and who has many chances to do so! ... and on the other hand girls have a lot of chances to escape, but do not do it! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just scratched this one!
