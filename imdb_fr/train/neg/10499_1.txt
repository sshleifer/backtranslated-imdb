OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was a television show "The Crocodile Hunter", with bad actors, bad scripts and a bad staging between Steve, who captured us or taught us animals. He was entertaining as a researcher / animal specialist. Millions will miss him. But the idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken that it was almost non-existent. Casting was horrible. The acting was not even worth the actors at the primary school level. Management must also be criticized. If you fail to get a decent midway performance from your actors, no matter how good the script, you do not have to be as good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course, I watched it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) on outings with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie, but he still did not ask to see it again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I would not want to be remembered for this film. Respect him: avoid this movie!
