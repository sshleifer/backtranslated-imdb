The German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has achieved a task that many fans of horror thought impossible: he is distraught by his compatriot Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of the director of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as risky and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I looked at it in its entirety, morbidly fascinated to see that the bar was low. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a grave and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the distribution of unknown strangers. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, can easily understand how Lommel has managed to find as many aspiring actors willing to spit his ridiculous dialogue with an impassive face. <br /> <br /> The main character, a nasty police beat, is played by a German actor with a German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest defeated cop in Los Angeles. Despite the fact that he stops innocent female drivers and keeps them in custody, then drags them home (which is inexplicably the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in the sight of his recruits partners , the LAPD refuses to investigate, even going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers during a ninja-style raid on his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are terribly bad. The budget of the production designer apparently included just enough money for a pot of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> As the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals - a sad assortment of European emigrants (possibly deported if they acted in their home country), bimbos, mimbos and women desperate middle-aged - and as little money has been spent for trays, special effects, places or other production value, it's fair to mention that they wore an authentic police uniform. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car. Uniformed police crisscross the streets in a brand new Mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the dirty actions of our deranged German police officer and the vain efforts of two young recruits to stop him. One of these young actors is particularly pitiful, because he is the only actor in all this mess to have even a vague shot for a real career in the cinema. The other is perfect, with a rockabilly hairstyle and tortured Brando poses that deserve to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is where the title takes its zombie, as victims of our killer is resurrected after murdering a girl who had just visited voodoo priestesses so that it is protected by a protective spell. Do not ask why a girl from Romania would use voodoo in preparation for the murder, simply accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd journey. <br /> <br /> After a long claw in hand in straw-covered tombs by the side of the road, zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly like before death, maybe even prettier, with a glamorous black makeup generously sprayed around the eyes. They do not look like zombies, they look more like fashion models ready for the podium. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his famous compatriot Boll and injects large doses of Euro-Trash Techno cheese into the soundtrack. We are talking about prehistoric electronic drones. They may have played in a nightclub in Ibiza while Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's daughters speak and function normally ... uh, I mean, as they did before they became zombified. This gives our author many opportunities to cover us with his golden dialogue. Yes, it's a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock that ends. All I can say is that it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit still lives ... or should I say his geist.
