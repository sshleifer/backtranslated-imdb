I bought this film for 1 euro, not knowing what it was. I thought to myself "hmmm, a movie named man mutilation must be very funny at least filled with gore". It was not funny. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind bothering movies but this one just did not want to say anything, except that abusing a child is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. The acting game ... there was no game. Just a fcker that mutilates for more than 90 minutes. It's probably important for sicko to get into the extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Do not look at that. It's not worth your time. It's just horrible. I wish I never bought this. <br /> <br /> They should mutilate the guy who did that
