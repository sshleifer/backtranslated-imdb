This film has a promising start and then becomes very confused and confused. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort to make the period correct, too bad that he does not spend more time on the plot. Most of the little characters in the film present themselves for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, I am very disappointed, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
