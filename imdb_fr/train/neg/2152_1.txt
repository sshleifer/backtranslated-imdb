this film tries to be immensely intelligent, and in the manner of Tarantino <br /> <br /> Before attempting this, you need a solid foundation in film. This includes good sound, editing, scenography, etc. ... <br /> <br /> lets talk about sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious. I've never been more distracted by a soundtrack, never <br /> <br /> and before we talk about budget, Chile-made film, etc., keep in mind that the sound of disenchantment our days are far more achievable than ever. nowhere. and more information about the technique is available more than ever <br /> <br /> the sound in this movie is just bad. the foley in particular is inappropriate and inappropriate, the atmosphere is just as terrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor editing. the sound in the cars is awful, the sound of closing the doors of the cars is awful. the sound of the singing lady is false. Foley is either at the sea or just not there as the sound person just got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong. everything is wrong here and yet, leaving no limits to the creativity that hinders us, the film tries boldly to be clever. for example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the next street scene. we hear sounds when we are not supposed to. the sound changes precede the visual cuts. every turn of the book is used, and yet the foundations are simply not there <br /> In terms of editing, we have scenes using heavy cuts, we tinker with the timeline, and so on. , yawn. all these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low level <br /> <br /> overall, the mix is ​​crap, the sound is crap. and then, the movie is shit. How can a film with so many fundamental flaws be considered a prize and praise? The new cinematographic wave of Chile? the best creative production that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and best talent has avoided this film like the plague, perhaps because of its risky content. In the same way, the film probably received such a laudatory and unjustified welcome from the followers of the "world cinema" for the same impossible reasons. they are probably reveling in his trash. Of course, movie critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality <br /> <br /> this film is void. it's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a grade of 6.8. the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, porn inspired by the new wave!
