This film made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were errors of continuity and intrigues that stopped as abruptly as they began. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, in addition to that, Danny Glovers has always trusted the taste and respect he has in choosing his roles, "Grand Canyon" for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed like an eternity, but it probably only lasted a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you understand or sympathize with them, there was no evocation of emotion about this movie and the clips of their past were bad mounted, confusing and useless. What could have been a good idea for a movie, even as a drama and not as a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better makes me laugh) has become a loss of my credit of $ 1 to the video store.
