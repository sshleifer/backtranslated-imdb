This film is S-L-O-W. I spent most of the film waiting for its beginning. <br /> <br /> The setting was dark, the scenario was dark, the cinematography was dark, the plot was dark, the budget was low (not that the low-budget movies are bad, but this one does not had no usable functionality). <br /> <br /> The plot was more consumed by a vengeful hunter, slightly disturbed than the real Wendigo who made a very brief appearance towards the end of the film. That in itself was disappointing because this 'Wendigo' was just a strange mixture of a tree and a deer. Everything in the movie was irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The boy's parents seemed to be rather distant and sometimes seemed completely detached from their son. Whether it's a bad scenario or a bad scenario, I'm not sure, but that has only increased my levels of disappointment and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing could arouse interest. Without intrigue or real cold factor, this film has so much that you do not worry about what happened in the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's vibe reminds me of the drab film presented at the awards ceremony towards the end of "Mr Bean's Holiday": an absurd and artistic film that seeks too much to be deep and significant, but that seems pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to look at this again. I only watched it all the way in the vain hope that something interesting could happen ... but it did not happen.
