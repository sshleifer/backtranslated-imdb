This film is an excellent example of how some very funny jokes can be terribly wrong. I was really expecting at least something from this movie after seeing the addition that was funny like hell, but the movie was not so good. <br /> <br /> What's strange is that the jokes are really funny, the pardons of the ban on smoking, Jo Bole ... etc. are really good jokes but I do not know who to blame this flop. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors) and the hammeresses (actresses) and not even the funny kind 2) The director 3) The guy who threw the actors and / or the director Anyway, if you're really bored and you really want to see this movie, if not get a copy of each ad or teaser of this movie and laugh because they will be much more fun than the movie movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only saving grace of this movie is mahesh manjrekar and the funny bhai chappee
