I was really horrified by this strange movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a scary musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes, you really start to sweat and feel uncomfortable, because you start to fear the worst. This film has the atmosphere of a real nightmare, and what is worse is everything. For an hour and a half, I have been trying to fight against complete boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack has kept me awake. Black Night is a really horrible picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and above all: your wallet, because the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap homosexual amateur movie is the greatest horror of all.
