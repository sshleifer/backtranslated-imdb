A handful of non-professional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about 30 seconds of marginal animation in stop-motion, but do not expect this margin when, for the rest of the film, the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around a room to jagged air. No time for terror when this film is diverted midway by these comical stupidities, which suddenly become the main characters; but again you have to admit that watching them trying to be funny is better than walking after the sheriff. It is only at the end that one of them gets eaten and the other stays on a rock crying tears of loneliness - it's not funny!
