What is there in the sky? Is it an airplane? Is this Superman ?? Uh no ?? It's a turtle!?! You see, that's what becomes the cold war! Nothing but bad news and other problems! The Americans shot down a Russian fighter somewhere in the Arctic and the resulting explosion defrosted and literally woke up the giant prehistoric creature named Gammera. This is not a very nice creature, because it follows that everything is destroyed and everyone is on their way. The debating governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a new ultra-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store? The damn turtle can fly! The first time, it happens in an extremely grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera is lying on his back, looking defeated when suddenly the fire is blowing in his armpits and he is propelled in the air. How can you not like that? Then there is also a secondary plot about an annoying child who is able to communicate telepathically with the monster, but it's just not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is not much else to write about this Japanese (and American reissued) science fiction effort, apart from the fact that it is an obvious and totally shameless scam of such classics. than the original Godzilla and The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and design of the monsters are extremely rigorous and, unlike the aforementioned movies, he never manages to create an apocalyptic atmosphere. Respectable actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not seem familiar with the scenery of the film in which they are filming, and even the original scenes of Japanese chaos are not very convincing. Gammera's clean and personalized theme song is pretty cool, so she earns an extra point for that.
