This film is like the material SE Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early '80s and, if Trueblood had been a product of either, the results could have been much better (especially in the actor department). Instead, we get a mediocre piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street jester, I guess that's the exact description. It was at the time action movies that used guys in their forties and mid-30s and dressed them with grease threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang clothes and they were were fighting for some ugly 1980s music. Nevertheless, Ray is the sole guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a party where he shouts a lot), which he is forced to leave inexplicably in a station when, taken Escaped by the police, he is caught and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to the present day and Ray is back in town looking for his brother who is also part of street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's opponent and now his old scores have to be dealt with violently (and again, the cops must be avoided and this time, a lady's honor is defended in the sense of the action movie) before Ray can continue to live at a normal pace with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the movie is pretty ridiculous. For me, most of this is due to far too much overkill, although it's not Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress with whom he befriends. The gang guys and Lowe himself seem to be doing a bit of unnecessary exaggeration like the tough ones on the street in New York. However, the biggest problem is the recycled plot and perhaps a kind of film that was well past its peak as a product of 1989.
