This film was nil with a capital "C" The opening scene was promising. But this "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learned where the plot was going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Morty, that was rather terrifying in the original movie, has a great look in this one. It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And who else thinks that "Morty" is one of the least scary names on planet Earth? He ranks just as high with "Jimmy" or "Fred" in horror value Or why not just name the wooden Henry-freakin'-Kissinger law. "Course, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as scary as "Morty." <br /> <br /> And then there's has a scene where the "hero" strikes His father's tombstone with "a hammer?", you might guess - "a two-for-four?", someone could venture out. angrily the tombstone of his father with a twig - a scary handjob.But worse than that, once the characters are gone, the tombstone bleeds inexplicably Oh brother! <br /> <br /> There There is also a Native American who lives with the grandparents of the main character, but apparently he does nothing Morty-talk.He perpetuates the frightening legends of Morty, warns those who do not care And even corrects Morty's arm when it's damaged during a child's joke. But despite all his respect and tenderness towards Morty, Morty gives a rat hair behind? No. <br /> <br /> The film drags on and many people eventually die in a way that matches their worst fears (somehow). This film is a true yawn. Do not rent it.
