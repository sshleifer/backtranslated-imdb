A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to see a doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive. It works but Adams slowly realizes that something is really wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> The interesting idea is perfectly made by an ugly script - the basic idea is OK but she becomes extremely predictable end. I saw every "twist" coming. The direction is mediocre - he seems not to know how to film a basic scene. The production values ​​are - to be nice - ugly. Very shabby. And the cold-blooded scenes are too nasty (I almost had it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the belly) with lousy special effects. The film completely derailed in the end when it became obvious that they did not know how to end this film. <br /> <br /> A good acting game makes it somewhat bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good in their roles and made me watch but that was about it. This film was released in 1991 and remains unknown - it is easy to understand why. I give him a 4.
