I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was based on Christianity. The director had a good idea / intention in making this film but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would always have feelings for what he believes to be the greatest love of his life. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones who did not know him. They did not understand at all and used God to explain their behavior. The main character, and no one else knew if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, etc., but they were against him, solving old feelings that had to be handled. His friends were supposed to be Christians and should have been portrayed as support, whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life without apologizing to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do it, they were all against him. The irony was that her new friend accused her of harassing behavior for simply looking for an old friend when she did something very strange to take over her name, her address and phone number ... she seemed to be the stalker. ! she did not seem like a friend at all, she just took care of herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person with whom they were supposed to be and I think the film did a terrible injustice in giving the impression that God does not care about the true love ... only that you stay with someone with whom you have made the wrong choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what you need to do to repair. As I said, the film had potential, but I was tired of the one-sided point of view being constantly repeated and stuck in the spectator's throat by his so-called ... well-meaning friends. This film is not faithful to the Christian conviction of love but I give him a C for his efforts.
