It's a very sad film. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I guess they just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers had to think: let's create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week, it only works in Antwerp and Brussels at 10:45 pm or something like that. In the past, we had very good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shades are a waste of time. Maybe you could slip into the theater after seeing a real movie. If you saw 10 minutes of Shades, you saw everything. He was announced to death on local radio and television. I hope it will disappear soon in the shadows.
