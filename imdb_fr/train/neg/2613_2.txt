This sequel is completely uneven, incoherent and disconcerting in "intrigue" (if there really is one) and tries too hard to be modern (ridiculous, 21st century style songs predominate) and cute (yawn: there are too many jokes made with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she is normally very good) flies over this film, parodying itself as being the original of De Ville and the main role of Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that is not even good to watch. This is a very good example of a bad and useless result. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, a characterization and an acceptable acting game. That does not want. It's bad.
