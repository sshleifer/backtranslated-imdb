Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, no questions asked! Critics of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged on the same criteria as others, because it is an independent film with a small budget, but it is already the case ?? amateurism and meager innovation are horrible. <br /> <br /> To agree on everything that has been said about this film, for example the careless game (when it's so serious, we take another shot to turn the scene, good God more annoying is the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming it was so during production, there was an obvious lack of respectful dialogue with the viewers. "The girls changed their personality several times and they seemed to show no sign of rationality or even brain - five relatively fit girls against a mild psychopath - to gang up on her, why not you? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered a sort of conquering this title is that the camera does not leave the van at any time, so the viewer sees everything from inside - which is, like the rest of the movie, a good idea executed exponentially, terribly. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, this film is nothing like the Blair Witch project, Cloverfield or any other. title filmed with a portable camera ?? it's an effect and not a trait! Used intelligently, it can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for the lack of cinematography.
