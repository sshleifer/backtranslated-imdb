I had the misfortune to catch two of the worst films of 2004: this morning, the incoherent void of The Chronicles of Riddick, piloted by CGI, and the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. A cost of several millions and the other a few cents, but they are both bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, I must say that I'm not Neil Young's biggest fan in the world, but he contributed his share of Buffalo Springfield's classic songs (the best recordings of which were Young's compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man wrote some very good songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale, and some precious ones, and the film around which they are built is really a simplistic and zany political slogans. Completely without merit as an art and unimpressive as a polemic, it is best to leave Greendale forgotten. Purchase the book if you feel you have to contribute to Young's bank account.
