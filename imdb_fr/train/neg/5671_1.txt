If you like to see live flayed animals, crushed head, dog's throat crushed, my men stomping, then this one is for you! But if you are a little normal and you do not need to see real images of animal cruelty, let this one pass. This film tries to shock the viewer, and he certainly does. With the snuff at the beginning and the killing of babies in the movie (at least fake), that was enough to make me turn it off. I saw movies like this before this slaughterhouse show ( BTK movie) and this kind of movie should not be allowed in a horror movie. We watch gore and horror because we know its just makeup and its special effects, so we should not sit and watch a movie and see the true animal slaughter, that's not why we rented the movie.If anything, there should be a big warning label affixed to these types of trash movies so people are not surprised . As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. All actors and the film crew need to check their heads.
