A very weak film, mainly because of a mediocre story, but also a bad action in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and an irrational behavior of the majority of the characters. If you are someone who likes to leave his mind aside and watch a movie for his creativity or game criteria, you may like this movie. Personally, I can not do that with a drama and I find that too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I am especially bored when a main character, who is supposed to be a smart person, acts continuously as a suit. imbecile. In this film, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first highly improbable act occurs when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves a party and falls on a girl, Mallory Doss, performed by Embeth Davidtz, who screams that his car was stolen. They are standing in a tropical rainstorm as he pushes her to agree to go home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about his strange father who belongs to some kind of strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at his dilapidated shack in the poorest part of town, they notice that his car is in the driveway. In addition, the lights in the house are lit and some objects in the house have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very weird, she's weird (she looks like a vagabond, she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked ... oh yeah!). Also, the father is strange, the house is a wreck - everything should have told Magruder, "Hey, it's too weird for me, I'm getting out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her, then, motivated by his story and sex, he tries to convince his father to engage. All of that screams with laughter! <br /> <br /> Then, being the top of the group - flight lawyer he is, he arrives late at the office dressed in the same shirt as the night before (a fact that all women in the office notice it) . Is it likely that a high-profile lawyer behaves like a Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases, so when he comes to the police, claiming with enough evidence that the father was terrorizing them, the police ignored him . I could have believed an audience reluctantly. But no help at all - unlikely! <br /> <br /> It's just too unlikely.
