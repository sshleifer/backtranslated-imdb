I appreciate the quality of shit, and this ranks among the best. the cg is out of this world, or at least is anterior to our world, and the madness of a six foot guy in a rat outfit chasing people is ridiculously bad. I really enjoyed some of that, but the acting is so horrible, and even the compulsory nude scene does not really have any baps. just a complete waste of time if I ever saw one. I do not know who lost more time, me watching, or the poor saps who were trained to do it in the hope that it will launch their acting career. I can assure you that this is not the case. However, on a clearer note, I managed to make Kevin Bacon's 6 degrees from this movie, so I think it was almost worth looking at the 91 minutes of it.
