I do not know what you're talking about, the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends, we could not stop crying. It's one of the funniest shit I've ever seen. This comment on porn is so right that hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is actually the worst, but it made me cry because of dummy characters, mediocre dialogue and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it! It looks like one of those movies of my drivers ed. class. The props seem to have come out of a theater show in high school. The music seems to come from an original game of the Nintendo system. The only thing that even scared me about this movie is that there was a killer clown who, who is not afraid of fat, hidden clowns? hahaha if anyone ever had to look at this, he should watch for the verbal mistakes of the actors, such as lyrics and some facial expressions. hahahaha, I'm dead. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
