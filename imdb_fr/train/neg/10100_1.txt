I usually support independent art and I try to be very complete and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are worth it ... <br /> <br but this film is moving away from any understanding and tolerance limits! <br /> <br /> imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think about the REALLY DIFFICULT horror movie you've ever seen in your life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. think of some great and interesting ART for the DVD box of this movie ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. That's it! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> See it only if you really have nothing better to do. Everything is going better.
