I read that Tom Robbins' SAME COWGIRLS had blues as a teenager. I liked every word. It was sexy, funny and full of glamorous landscapes and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe how it was a piece of dull junk, sour and joyless. How did it happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and classified it as "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the head of the Library of Congress.) Now everyone who reads this book will know that there is NOTHING to do with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real journeys in space. The book was obviously - and I mean MANDATORY - written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (nude, all the time) but never met him. <br /> <br /> Yet, someone in Hollywood said, "Uh, better give this to a gay director or a gay people will create problems." So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but - as gay as he is - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant was inspired by the mischievous fantasy of a straight man of action / guilt-free girl and the male voyeurism turned it into a dull and literally literal power recruitment poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into a tragedy of Arthur Miller. Not pretty. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant has absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the incredibly bad cast. His influence allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the true subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a straight man, not a recruiting poster for gay pride) led him to make choices that were not only bad, but weird. <br /> <br /> Let's meet the actors of EVEN COWGIRLS GET LES BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Well, there are few Asian actors to name recognition. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was pretty funny. But to designate it as THE CHINK was false, false, false. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus does not tell him.) Pat does not seem to know either that Chink is. . . well, sexy !!! In the book, he is not wise, Mr. Miyagi. He looks more like Hugh Hefner! He is an old goat and he knows a LOT of pleasing nubile and sensitive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they are not REALLY lesbians, do you understand that it's still a fantasy of a straight man?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "COMPESSE". Ok, he's a gay friendly man. But he's a serious actor, shakespearean! You need someone who is fun and camps for this role. For John Hurt, playing the comet as the countess is tragic and sad. I was still expecting Paul Scofield to dress in Thomas More and shake his head sadly. "Now, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. Too bad, my former student! And yes, John Hurt was funny (and quite gay) as Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not playful and playful humor like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book, Bonanza is funny, playful, playful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film, she is sullen, passive, expressionless and dull. As for his taste for women, Robbins in the book expresses it as well. "God knows I like women, but nothing can replace a man to his size." Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". It's a difficult role. In the book, Sissy is truly an exceptionally passive and shy heroine. Nevertheless, a more accomplished actress might have made a spark in her eye or a swing in her walk, suggesting a kind of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does not get it, probably because Gus never told him that Sissy is supposed to enjoy the hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This film is bitter and dull. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
