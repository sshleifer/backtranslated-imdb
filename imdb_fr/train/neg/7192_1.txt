5 minutes after the beginning of the film, I was hyperventilating, trembling and trembling with pain. And not the right way. The story goes that a troupe of idiot children makes phone calls to a psychopath, which is always a good idea. It turns out that psychos do not like phone calls because in 2 minutes he is at their door and kills Williams' poor parents. Well, go to 15 and guess what? Still kidding phone calling people. Oh yes, you thought that a horrible murder would deter them from doing it again, but no. So, after about two hours later and too many screaming scams, I realized that this movie only gave me a terrible taste in the mouth and a strong desire to commit suicide. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at the poor quality production, the "game", or Rutger's career. I love shitty horror movies, but it's the most unsatisfactory piece I've ever seen. Just do not.
