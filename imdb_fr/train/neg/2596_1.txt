Dear God! I was still waiting for this film to "start" ... then I waited for him to redeem himself ... and as he did not do it either, I sat there, stunned by the fact that: 1) it could be so terrible, and 2) I had just lost a few hours on pure stupidity. I thought Drew could not have done such a bad movie ... and if I had lost faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, badly played and just poorly designed! I can not believe that a scenario of this magnitude has ever been funded! He had a million chances to really do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this film to even be qualified!) And he ALWAYS could not leave anywhere! It's just pitiful! Where the other critic had the idea that it was not the worst, baffles me! Because believe me, if it got worse, I cut my wrists before finishing it!
