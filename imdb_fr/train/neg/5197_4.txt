Lower entry in Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Funny jokes and antics, but not a lot of conspiracy. Barrymore gets something to do as an inspector, exchanging disguises to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a wild goose hunting chase (mostly in a circle, maybe the budget was tighter than usually) to save poor Phyllis, who is held captive and wants to lure Drummond to ruin. For those who do, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry her and Algy worries about missing the baby's baptism. It's fun to watch Algy and Tenny get dressed as fishermen to blend in with Angler's Rest, but there's not much more than ridicule.
