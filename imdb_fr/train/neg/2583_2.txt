Another American Pie movie was thrown in the throat and this one is the worst of all. He does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a stupid porn movie on which they slapped the American Pie title. When I looked at it, I felt like I was watching another show. It does not look like American Pie at all. He has a different sense of humor, he is much more rude and has many more sex scenes than other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. In fact, I do not recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Stand in the original beautiful trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
