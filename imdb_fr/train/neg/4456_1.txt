It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. The fact that he has a mediocre scenario is already serious enough, because he has clung to it about violence in football, it's 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had great doubts about the premise of this film even before I started to watch, but I went quite open to accept how the writers saw fit to introduce the character of Elijah Wood, Matt, in the rogue scene. <br /> <br /> But the film suggests imprecision after inaccuracy, the point that, in the middle of the film, makes you cringe more than ever. <br /> <br /> Let's clear up a few points: hooligans do not tend to crush their own ads before the league game run they do not try to kill each other; they do not just wear Stone Island (and the others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do it). They certainly do not, after opposing a new cabinet member, do not go to the territory of their rival business to enjoy a cake. And I'd love to meet the hool that would hit the best boy in his business with the rival company. (Although you can erase what I said about wanting to kill you, if any). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I have not seen a movie on the subject that does not say it yet. Fantasy fantasy, but it's on a par with The Firm for cluelessness. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character of being a consumer of cocaine, while it is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to question the moral of Wood and avoids any use of coca by the firm. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I made myself clear. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is very unimaginative, and I'm sure if I had not spent the entire movie moaning, I'd do better what I did more high that I would have guessed what was happening earlier than me. And believe me, I was in front. <br /> <br /> I have the clear impression that this film is for men, with the hope that women will appreciate the injection of emotional problems that arise. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the officials have completely failed. It's too unrealistic to please everyone who knows the scene and I can not believe that the kind of woman who looks for emotional movies does not care about any character given her violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any positives? The fight scenes may be well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by the slow action. Certainly not when it comes to a fight because it is a pretty exciting ruck anyway. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments, so unrealistic. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But some slightly amusing moments compensate barely two hours of drosses manufactured. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid like the plague, do not yet develop misconceptions on the scene if you are not aware. If you are American, you will enjoy it because it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is fragile, predictable and ultimately excessive.
