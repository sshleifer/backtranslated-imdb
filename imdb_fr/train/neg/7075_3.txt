This is at least the third remake of this film, so if, while looking at it, you feel a sense of déjà vu, do not be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently, but the differences are not significant. And it's not better because the plot is flawed to start. It never works. And like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen the film before but whose end does not match the story. If this film had finished ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and would have been very satisfying and I would have thought it was worth it. But here is the spoiler and in the end, the crime pays because the criminal does not get caught. I never like this message resulting from a movie.
