Every year, I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur abominations, that should never be seen. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will forever remember as one of the most desperately laughable horror movies I have ever seen. in fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of watching it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it looks like some kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work in a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend the "zombies" to eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie, and I would not recommend it either because "so bad it's good". However, if you are entertained by the prospect of probably watching the most abominable film that is ever indefatigable? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me what is the worst film I have ever seen, I will say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie than a bad movie, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that stuns you with its incompetence. He's really the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I can not wait to see if he's making another film as consistently as ridiculous as this one.
