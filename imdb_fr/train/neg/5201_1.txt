The story has already been seen, but it does not matter if you can find a suitable storyline. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on the storyboard. At the same time, the cameraman has spent far too much time taking angles that do not match the movie's message. The funny thing is though, if you check out the movie's website, you can read that it's deliberate that the director chose to do the movie with bad angles of view. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with mediocre camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is OK. Too bad Ti West did not spend more time re-reading his story. It's as if the film was more important than planning. Because you have a camera, that does not mean that you should make a movie right now ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be so good. So a tip to Ti West is: stop and tag what you want. Use your time to start planning and not film until everything is recorded on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and the desire - so do not abuse your talent.
