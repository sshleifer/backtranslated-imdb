After seeing only half of the movie at school in November, today I saw that he was on the Flix channel and I decided to watch him to see the rest and write a new comment to that topic. <br /> <br /> The book on which the movie is based, Hatchet, is OK. It's a terrible adaptation of it though. <br /> <br /> Terrible scenes (and I say horrible), a poor dialogue and a medium cinematography constitute this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> The movie starts with Brian, who is the clichéd image of a teenager in the late '80s (wearing a mule, punching at the sound of 80's rock music) and his mother driving a car so that he gets on a plane where he can see his father his parents are divorced ... now the dramatic pause.) Now Brian has said goodbye to his mother and dog and flies off to see his father. The pilot is a big, ugly and rude man (it was not like that in the book) who, after 2 minutes of flight, suffers a heart attack and dies. In the book, the details are more detailed, the pilot having more trouble and seeming to be in the air much longer before the heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within two minutes) was left empty of fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to assume that it has been up there for hours even though the sun not changed position and the landscape has EXACTLY the same thing.) Now it crashed. <br /> <This is the point in the film where everything is very different from what it was in the book. In the book, it was said that his jacket was ripped to shreds, but in the film, he is perfectly in good condition, without tears or tears (it looks like he just bought it), he never said that he had climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there. on the mountain, he never said he was attacked by a bear (he said a moose but not a bear), he never said he eats the many insects he does, he never mention the second tornado or learn how to get these sparrows, skin them and eat them or eat this small fish trap that it makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes) and does not mention nor the fact that he is injured in the ribs of one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I do not even think you can call what the movie describes a tornado. It was nothing but a storm that knocked over many of his belongings. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp was Brian's lame flashbacks (which are never mentioned in the book), especially Brian's cliché scene waking up. standing up, going to the window and seeing his father (with all his packaged things that can fit perfectly into the back of his truck), he leaves and shouts "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (Of course, his father did not hear him even though he was just outside) and he knocks his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing that getting closer to what happened in the book (I said close by.) In the book, I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was " you're the kid they're looking for! "They stopped a few months ago ..." Still, they left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) returning to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume they were gathering for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then he shows his temporary home (for what, in the movie, it seemed like three days, but in the book for several months) and his hatchet, still in a tree where he left it (this has not been written in the book either) and showing where he engraved a message, so perfectly done: "HOME" ( where are we really supposed to believe that he engraved this message) perfectly with just this hatchet?) <br /> <br /> No quote can summarize this movie more satisfactorily than when Enid of Ghost World said: " It's so bad that we went well and we got bad again. " Perfect description of this film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who did not read the book) and I'm just looking at a movie, or someone who read the book ( because they will be disappointed and bored to death. <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination has created for the film.This is awful and will make you think about the book. br /> <br /> 1/10
