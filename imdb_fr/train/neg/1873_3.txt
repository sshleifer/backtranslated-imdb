Are you kidding me!!!! Let's discuss the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, not just an entry into the "club of oddities of the month" of actors. Really, unless it's supposed to be a tasteless satire on David Mamet - a terse and confusing dialogue delivered alternately in machine gun speed or a monotonous (think Ben Stein) bland - or a dry flat comedy; this film must be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award - or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have the stiffest and most uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this already bizarre cast, there are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, that resemble or resemble the escapees of America's next supermodel, Don Pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word "summer" as "bean", which draws our attention to the fact that there is so little to love about this film, we analyze his accent to guess whether he is Canadian or not! ! I think I laughed well in places supposed to be serious and took seriously passages that are meant to be humorous. Even the soundtrack looks like a caricature of Alarik Jans' music for Mamet's "House of the Games". Taken as a parody, the film is almost funny. if taken seriously, just a piece of self-conscious drek.
