The premise and the subject of making a criminal understand what his victims have experienced by capturing his family hostage seems promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part that the director Ravi Tandon also treated with great finesse in his film "Jawab" (1985). The problem here is that the director of Ace, Rajkumar Santoshi, found himself in a confusion to make a fast-paced action thriller (namely Khakee) or a drama with high intensity and rich in emotions (Viz Damini ) and this confusion is quite obvious in the final result. Lajja (2001), this great director has always given us some pretty captivating and entertaining movies, which is a surprise for what made this scenario sensitive to the director? Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman: As the film ended, the audience did not know who to hate and who to sympathize with, this factor is the main limiting force of the complete narrative. Hell gift ends as Trange note of self-realization and regret by the Don on what was wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real villain is not a surprising element of the paroxysm that, when compared to a similar situation in "Khakee", worked so well with the character of Aishwarya. That's not all, there is more than that. The life of a hell Don, operating from abroad, seems quite illogical. His open landing in Mumbai, where he is supposed to escape and run after his enemies and shoot them down, does not seem credible. Like Aryeman in front of Mr. Bachchan, this is not a good idea, but the film has some positive points. in the first half of the season, Santoshi's quick treatment and of course, as usual, Mr. Bachchan strive to bring life to his lifeless character, but all of these elements together do not make this a viewing experience exciting r you and your family!
