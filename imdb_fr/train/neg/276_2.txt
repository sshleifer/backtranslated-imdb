The characters are clich√© and predictable, each being either pure as snow, or totally bad. The acting game is too hot to be bad in a funny and exaggerated way. It's a double disappointment if you're a fan of Bette Davis, because her character is not a typically fun character, like Bette-Davis; she can only frown thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> Overall, neither my wife nor I found the film interesting, moving or enjoyable.
