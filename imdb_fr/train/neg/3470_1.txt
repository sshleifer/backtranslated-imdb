As in most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. If you want to call it a story. Many points were left connected without any thought at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because, it would mean that the torture would have lasted longer. As for none of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and can only be survived by the other actors. Even in this case, the acting was mostly artificial and improbable. The trip to the past with actors I have not seen for years was not worth the price of entry. Everyone thought it had to be said, they also quickly join the ranks of "has-been". My choice was to wait for my car to be repaired or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. Overall, I would make a laugh ... mainly because that's all I got from it.
