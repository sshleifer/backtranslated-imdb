This film is a good example of how, through the manipulation of the media, you can sell a film that is nothing more than a very funny little TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the most widely circulated daily newspaper has continuously written about the wonders of this film, almost silencing all others. Coincidentally, the second-run newspaper belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island to have analyzed the form and content of the film and highlighted all its flaws, clich√©s and bad writings. laughing with easy and obvious jokes, and because you can recognize actors and sets, does not make it an acceptable movie.
