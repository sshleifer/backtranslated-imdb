This movie was horrible. The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic, but it was written to unfold in the real world. The editing and lighting effects are worse than most early film school projects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone: A) knows all the details of the world of the police or secret operations. B) knows all the details concerning the making or the appreciation of a film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to medium or below average mind, I think it would be a pleasure if I was an idiot. If you have to watch this movie in its entirety, I highly recommend you some kind of intoxication. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of the little production value it has.
