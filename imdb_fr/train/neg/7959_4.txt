Andy Lau plays in another story under cover of a cop. Daniel Wu plays the role of Nick, who works for the police and is also close to the group of drug traffickers (Lau). The film begins as we watch the police try to remove a drug to see it collapse. We are then introduced to the young drug addict mother and her daughter, who live near Nick, as well as to his friends and the cops. In 45 minutes, I close the film and put the news. Well done and good to watch, it is a film as little involved as I have seen for a long time. It's not bad as such, but you do not care. I mean, I really did not care at all. In fact, I started doing something else completely forgetting that I had a subtitled movie, that's how much I did not care. I wish I could hate the movie, but the movie is a non-entity that almost did not impress me (it's not even something I could sleep, it's just something to ignore). Come on, the box called the Chinese Scarface, after his death? This is to be avoided.
