I'm not sure why I clicked on "contains a spoiler", because very honestly, there is not enough explanation in the movie to know enough about what is supposed to happen to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Visually, he delivers mostly. Well, except for a couple of rubber-masked monsters from the 80s. Now, before I look at that, I've never seen the Lordi band, and I did not know anything about them except that they had won Eurovision. Apparently, the monsters are members of the group, almost in their stage characters. It does not matter. In any case, I did not know it while watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were passable. Just about. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but maybe it's better not to know it. It would probably have been incredibly lame to think about it. The action continues well enough for the viewer to be entertained, even if half of the fun factor about wtf is supposed to happen exactly in this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave it a score of four. mainly because I laughed at it, especially because it explains almost nothing. It was probably the atmosphere in which I was, but I found it hella funny for some reason. Then I watch the movie on the internet and discover that no one knows what it is supposed to be made of. It amuses me further and raises my score by half an extra point to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, nor particularly coherent, but it's pretty pleasant visually and acoustically. Overall, far from essential, but observable. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make sense and it could entertain you if you are in a good mood.
