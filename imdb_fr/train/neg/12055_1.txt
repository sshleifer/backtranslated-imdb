Do not spend your money or your time on this dreadful movie under the guise of cinematography. When every third word is devoted to vulgar language and there is no real plot, as well as the cast of old actors the same performances of the past and have not evolved in their career leave much to say. I was expecting something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others might have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by garbage such as Maldeamores. A rude word at a given moment in a movie can be used to emphasize a given point of view and can even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the film Elsa and Fred for example), but it should not permeate the plot . The movie is totally embarrassing and there is absolutely nothing funny or even cute in this movie.
