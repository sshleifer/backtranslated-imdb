In the UK, we rarely have a film about life in inner-city neighborhoods from the point of view of the Afro-Caribbean community. The last example I remember is that of Babylon underestimated in 1980. So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that was portrayed as the British version of Hate! Well, hate it is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film an authenticity that has recently been lacking in other British films, but my concern is that this film ends predictably unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The film cleverly deals with the escalating problem of violence between blacks that is unfortunately very common in London, but I fear that filmmakers now only use cast in the plot, as opposed to the characters, which is just as damaging. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspiring for all of us, but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a black young man in London, the only possible future is violence and tragedy.
