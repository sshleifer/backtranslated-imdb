I saw this for the first time when it was chosen as the suggestion of my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. On top of that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the appearance of his 1930s cartoon. With both, I thought it would hold my interest. I was wrong. A few minutes later, the Fast Forward button was pressed. I covered it in about 15 minutes and thought it was. <br /> <br /> Then I read some of the other reviews and I thought I did not give him enough chance. I recorded it again and looked through. It does not come back to me 75 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe there are not more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's difficult to reach the minimum 10-line comment. How many ways do you say it's a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film looks like a song made up of a few college kids ready to indignant the world and think they can do it with profanities and blasphemies. and joke. The characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame. It basically consists of mixing the melody, crossing A - E, striking the obvious blasphemy of an "F", then not knowing where to go. The journey through the intestines until the planned landing does not work the first time, let alone the following ones. <br /> <br /> In general, the film as a whole is what you expect from someone trying to "get out of South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is funny or not. It could be fun if you are up. Otherwise, it is not.
