Dropping down and drugged, while a kidney stone was making its way happily into my healed urinary tract, with nothing better to do than let the painkillers sink into a half-forgotten state, I caught this movie by cable. I would not want anyone to think that I paid to watch it in a movie theater, or rent it, or ?? paradise turns around! ?? that I looked at it RIGHT. <br /> <br /> After playing this sensational video game and eagerly roaming the doomed rooms and the dreadful passages of The House, fighter Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and Other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would be transferred to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? at the Scooby Doo ?? to attend a distant island for a "rave" that shakes the world ?? Whatever it is. (You today's kids with your hoops and miniskirts and your Pat Boone ??) After buying a boat captain in cash to transport him (a stupidity that calls his own network of rhetoric), they find the "rave" abandoned. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is mention of a "house" ?? presumably the home owner of the dead ?? but most of the time, the action takes place on false exterior settings and other places divorced from any semblance of haunted residence. <br /> <br /> A fallen video camera serves as a charge back back, showing the island struggling with ?? Party?! Is that right? Oh, so this thing "rave" is just a "party"? In the great tradition of re-euphemizing "used cars" as "used cars", or "cock shocks" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "holiday" is now too square for you. metrosexual jagoffs implanted? <br /> <br /> We learn that the party was broken by unleashed zombies. Smart thinking stops there? <br /> <br /> I do not think pinheads called writers and directors understand the myth of resuscitation of zombies. Zombies can not die ?? they are already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they do not know the pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue to be animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> Which means that a shot in their "heart" is not going to stop them, nor a machete on the chest. And a gunshot in the chest will certainly NOT produce drops of blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter infuses so many tricks into each monster that he is completely decimated, leaving a foul field that can not be resuscitated. <br /> <br /> Yet every actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, killing zombies on all fronts with single balls and karate chops up to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more inefficient than the Return Of The Jedi Stormtroopers, who are stunned when Ewoks deceive them. <br /> <br /> I guess the author of the film, Mark Altman, wrote the not-too -shabby "Free Enterprise", felt obliged to insert a reference from Captain Kirk, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who was desperately in need of silver milk for succumbing to his place in this aromatic idiot. Reference is also made to Prochnow's main role in the beautiful "Das Boot", where one of the untrained band B players mentions that he "looks like a U-Boat captain". I wonder how many targeted viewers of this film, square-eyed pigs, have captured ALL sneaky references to other movies, such as when Prochnow said, "Greet my boyfriend," presaging the moment of his machine gun <BR /> <br /> Intended for a demographic group that does not have the means to understand the sisyphe futility of the video game concept (that is, the game ends when you die, you do not can not win), it is simply a scathing film for the brainless As a result, everyone dies in due time, with the exception of a heterosexual couple of attractive whites. <br /> <br /> A better use of the limited but misused budget of this film could have been to send the acting distribution The school, although the left breast of Ona Grauer did a good job, as was the right breast and the scenes of the race at the slomo: it is priceless! I particularly liked the stage the final, Ona trying to pretend she was stabbed, but she had just eaten ice cream. cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Trying to do something more con structive with my time, I released my 35th anniversary, special edition, numerically restored anamorphic DVD of "Manos: the hands of fate". Ah yes! ?? the drugs were pretty scary - now, HERE, some quality movies ?? (<br /> <br />) (Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com)
