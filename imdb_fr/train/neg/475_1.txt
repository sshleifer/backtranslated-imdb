One of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this film in my American history class and the goal was to see an incentive for a farmer's life in the West in the late 1800s. We saw pigs being slaughtered then slaughtered. human birth, a brand. Oh, and at the end, a calf was born alive and let me tell you that the birth itself was not that bad, but the many fluids that came out of it led most of my class to The bathroom. The story itself was OK. The story is based on a widow and her daughter settling in the west to take care of the cowboy's house. They live a difficult life and it is an interesting and quite accurate vision of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.
