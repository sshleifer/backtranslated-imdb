Well, I must say it's probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely raw (we did not expect it as a PG movie) (rated PG in Canada) and they were not funny! With this superb cast, I was expecting at least a good acting, but I did not even understand it. I am a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I am extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn nor Uma Thurman's characters are a little friendly and I really could have cared less about what happened to them. I did not expect that at all, as I used to like other films from this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example). This film was not worth the $ 10 it cost me and I strongly encourage you not to see it. . I guarantee you will be like me imploring that this film is finished.
