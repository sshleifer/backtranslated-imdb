I saw this movie a long time ago when it was screened. <br /> <br /> It was based on the idea that children with autism could communicate with typed messages, another person only helping and guiding their hands. <br /> Then all of a sudden, these kids, many of whom did not even watch the keyboard or the screen when the messages were typed (they could sometimes look at the ceiling on the ceiling), but their moderators were the staring at the keyboard, began typing abuse messages from their parents and others, sending parents and child protection agencies to a probative trial, left and right. <br /> <br /> This whole thing turned out to be a mistake when a third party presented a file, open it to the child and say "tap the image you see", then when the presenter turned the file back to the moderator, a fold would fall, revealing another different image. <br /> <br /> the child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Every time, when he was fulfilled, the name of the typed picture corresponds to what the moderator has observed, never to show the child. <br /> <br /> So who was typing? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This film has also taken a disastrous turn with, as the Australian poster says, the person who assaulted the child in the film was IN the situation in the process of help. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never put her son in this place, he would not have been molested, that's what the movie says. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I entrust my child to your organization to help him and he is molested, do you think I will want to listen to everything you need to do? to say after that? Not likely! I think it's a safe bet that all these accusing messages that these children were typing, on which this movie was based, they never accused anyone in their operation as it happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the film gave a very good performance of Gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the movie did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst was by far the child who was banging at the end of Patty Duke, and we hear the mechanical voice re-read what he typed. . . . . "We won!" This child was assaulted. If you cut my leg and I bring you to justice and you're found guilty of inflicting damage, aggression, it does not matter, then it's legal justice, but it does not bring me back. <br /> <br /> better, in my state, I will see it as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> Whatever chance that child has to what is perceived as normal with autism alone, it is even more damaged by sexual assault. <br /> <A "normal" child has enough to cope with such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is quite superficial to think that you have to look at all situations and go "we won" if that person is convicted. to the court. <br /> <br /> Just a bad treatment of a situation and circumstances all around.
