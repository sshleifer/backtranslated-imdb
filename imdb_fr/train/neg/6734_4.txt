I found this film a good idea, which did not succeed. It seems that they have found a way to create suspense, but they could not very well organize their winnings. In one case, the police are at the clock to find the hiding place of the kidnappers. They go painfully from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all, the police arrive at the same time as they free themselves, which is at least anti-climatic. There are also great storytelling scenes that draw us into the "thinking" of the terrorized husband and wife, which harms the suspense rather than adding to it. We are fully aware of their tension and the voiceover is an insult and deprives the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has proven time and time again, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to get through the whole movie and get the end fast and rather bland. I mean just ... "ends" in a snoring.
