Please, make me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider the film an insult to my brain and back, both of which have suffered from my sitting position and watching this film. I have not yet seen the damage that has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of garbage !! And do not start talking about actor ... Help me, please, to forget !! "Strange science" - come back !! All is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm "proud" to give this movie the first 1 here at IMDb ... And I've already voted for hundreds of movies ... A lot of but it's so bad that I can not even believe it. Someone really got the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a movie? Someone read the script and decided to produce the movie? Someone read the script and auditioned for that? Someone saw the movie and decided * not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These are the questions I want answers to. Not the philosophical question about this tree in the woods and well, you know ...
