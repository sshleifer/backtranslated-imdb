But there are good actions and a somewhat interesting plot. Nevsky behaves like a bodybuilder and he is not very attractive. In fact, IMO, it's UGLY. (Her acting skills are lacking in everything!) Sascha is very well performed by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more replicas than the ones she had, her character had to be developed. There are far too many men in this story, there is no romance, too much action and an end too stupid. It's very violent. However, I loved the scenery, this movie takes you around the world, and it's a bonus. I also liked the fact that it contains information about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to get my attention. The actors had to be more beautiful ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be pretty hot, but for us, passionate action ladies, Nevsky does not cut him. Overall, this movie was fine, I did not like it either, I hated it, I just thought it was another normal action movie.
