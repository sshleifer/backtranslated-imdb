I saw this movie and the other. Trinity is my name and I think this one is worse than the first. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was stupid and useless, sorry to say I have them all. I sat through them a number of times and it always pushes me to turn it off 5 minutes after the beginning of the movie. I like the movies of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, but this movie made me climb the wall. If he had had a different story or at least more plot and comedy, it could have been more fun and well worth the $ 5 I spent to buy all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I would tell you to save your money and not to leave this movie or those who go with it, trust me.
