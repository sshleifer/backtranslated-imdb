To overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what anyone in his position would do naturally (at least in a film by Peter Greenaway): he and his son populate their house with eight and a half women (we do not have legs), women and men. to embark on a sexual odyssey. This being a Greenaway movie, there is a lot of pretentious and uninteresting chatter and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact, father and son share a bed that sleeps naked. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old man completely frontal? For those who are not in the homoerotic scene, one of the women likes to do the bad with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of matte scenes.
