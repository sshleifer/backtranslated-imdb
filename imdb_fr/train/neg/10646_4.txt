Last of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films and a good thing too, because it is clearly the worst of the 12 films he has made over a period of 16 years. No siren is here, any more than a beautiful woman from the island who tries to escape the clutches of her people, who adores a god and tries to force her to marry him. She finds Tarzan and Jane trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially mean high priest, but he is not used to his advantage. There is also an annoying guitarist / singer singing from time to time. Even the "big" Robert Florey will not help this one. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
