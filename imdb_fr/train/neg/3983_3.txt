Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this mediocre film. She should have gone out with a bang, being the class actress she was, not in this immeasurable film, almost unknown. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is not serious, but nothing special. The first half is much better because it becomes pretty stupid in the second half. Irene could perhaps see the handwriting on the wall and leave. Even his high-pitched voice is a little annoying here. Rumor has it that she was not happy with this movie. We understand why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a 50s TV sitcom. Speaking of which, I thought David Nelson of the TV show Ozzie & Harriet was part of that movie, but he turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and looked like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Overall, at best, a mediocre end for a great actress.
