This is only a little appealing to "bad movie" fans. This is more for the 1970s pop culture students: fashions, furniture, attitudes, and that great moment of "women's freedom" of the early 1970s, when it was still fresh and new for a Independent and independent woman to exist. <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a rewarding career, though disconcerting (after all, she's a stewardess but a waitress at 30,000 feet - that's also true for men), she slept with several men, could protect herself and others (with karate) and was not tied to anything. It's the kind of emancipated woman that scares the anti-feminists, those backslidden idiots who believe that no woman is perfect without a husband. <br /> <br /> The sexy hostess is a powerful archetype from the late 1960s to the 1970s (I do not even remember "The Partridge Family"), Ruben Kincaid, a young boy going to swing, constantly meeting flight attendants). , free love, women's lib, swing of the seventies. The plot is pretty terrible though. And for the cavemen of the public, there are few topless to look at.
