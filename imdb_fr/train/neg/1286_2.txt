How does a Scottish kilt make love in the bonny purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now, I have a distinct advantage over many other critics in the sense that I was born in Scotland. Far too many Americans take this simplistic absurdity seriously. It's a joke, people, "four good legs - two bad legs", as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has an accent that the production of "Brigadoon" from the Seas Dramatic Society of the Seas Dramatic Society would be denied. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with women - wears her kilt with all the authority of a man whose grandmother got off the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the enemy Auld? Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame everything? Messrs. Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed to engage in such racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - The Prince of Thieves" seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy. At least Alan Rickman was funny.
