Yes, I saw the rough cuts. Unpublished sex scenes. The scenes cut terribly. Almost at the same level as the movie 'The Need' for an awful acting act. This movie is as bad as the bad movies. The bad scenario, the bad acting, the bad effects, the bad locations, the bad stunts and everything. The best "actors" of the movie were the bright dancers who had been hired for the vampire supplements! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the actor "fop", as someone else has said, gives this match an exceptional talent. Her amazing ability to drive a car badly, when she is visibly shaken by people on the bonnet (check the reflection in the windshield), her inability to turn left, which is classy. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. plus its remarkable use of a toy pistol that accessory guys could not even be bothered to disguise as a real gun. The other actors on the screen could barely deliver their lines. It was as if, half the time, they were waiting for a line that did not exist! <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were so good that the guys who did it took their real name from the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, rent this movie ... but again, there are lots of good funny comedies do not give money to people who do not deserve it not.
