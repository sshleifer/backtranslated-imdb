I must admit that the draw of this film is the director Eduardo Sanchez, who led the extremely popular and successful Blair Witch project. In addition, it is an extraterrestrial film, which resembles Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those films that critics hated, but which I appreciated. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately, I got the impression that for most things, Altered is a waste of time, so I will keep this review brief. The locals are always promising, and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who lived strange encounters when they were younger and, as usual, others will take you for a sacred case of imagination. The alien abduction stories must always deal with probes in the holes, so I will not go into details, but you understand what's going on, which is damn uncomfortable and you'd like to forget. <br /> <br /> And if you gave a chance for revenge? That is to say that you manage to stalk and capture a living. What will you do? For this group, it's a fun recovery period, or at least they thought. And this is where the movie begins to become one of the most snoozefest, with mediocre, uninteresting, and even worse dialogues. Even if the budget is low, there are not many redeeming factors, be it the strength of the scenario or the help provided by the distribution to make their characters a little interesting. This is the standard cardboard dish of a classic vanilla style, combined with inexpensive panic tactics. <br /> <br /> What's good is makeup. A lot of effort has gone into realizing some things that I will not talk about, as it will only spoil the few things that make this film tolerable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, the bloody and bloody moments that are never seen before. <br /> <br /> Look at this only as a last resort. Compared to the other city monster movie - Feast, this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously. Locked in an uninteresting direction, you have been warned.
