Although this release is certainly not up to its predecessor, it offers more than its share of memorable moments. My favorite, just after devastating a block with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear flows from his left eye, we know at this point that Nimoy is more than a killing machine. The viewer can not help being drawn into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat effect was just a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! The sex scenes show a nice balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Subsequently, I had a good understanding of how the Magnavision videodisc player works. Too bad they have not produced them for over 25 years.
