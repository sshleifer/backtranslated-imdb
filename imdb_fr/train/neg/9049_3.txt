A "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad stereotypes of the South, complemented by dummy accents. Not only would it be offensive to most people in the southern United States, but this shabby work is like a film "A baby in prison" barely disguised - especially in its original uncut version. Nevertheless, the acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, is doing a good job of making the viewer hate him - even if he looks rather uncomfortable in many scenes. The late Robert Reed, who appears as a lascivious director, also has a role to play. Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") has created a pretty credible sadistic prison guard.
