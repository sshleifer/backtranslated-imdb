... and I actually gave him a zero on my personal scale 1-10. I've been watching movies since 1952 and I've seen more than 1,000 in the theater (I do not watch movies that I only see on TV). It's the ONLY film I've ever attributed to zero. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26 years old) who alerted me to this site (amazed by the fact that the film gets an overall rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish (and is even worse in retrospect), the acting (especially Sean Young) is atrocious and the screenplay is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
