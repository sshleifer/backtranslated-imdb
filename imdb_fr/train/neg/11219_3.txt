It was a film about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "twin" connection feels that something is wrong with her sister. This film took forever to establish the plot. A conspiracy that has been done several times. The acting game was ugly for the most part. Once the plot meets, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with a violent father. The father seems to prefer Ashley, so Laura is accused of everything. It was promised that girls would never be separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley finds a job in a restaurant where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing can result. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse to find a way to find him. I was still waiting for this film to go better and there was a resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
