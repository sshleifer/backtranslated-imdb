What about this movie? Well, this is a group of good students who have harmful drugs and who turn into delinquent students who sell more of these substances to others. Two of these people have side effects when a person turns into a poisonous avenger and his girlfriend vomits a creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's about all there is to do, and it's 84 minutes long. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked up forever. Although it's not fair, some people like Troma's movies and can watch them if they want. For me, Troma movies are the worst movies ever. I have just looked at this one out of morbid curiosity.
