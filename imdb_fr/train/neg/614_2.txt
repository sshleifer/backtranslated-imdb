I'm watching this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible that I can not stop looking at it! I am a videographer and this film makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Part of the camera work is good. Most is very questionable. There are some decent actors in the movie. Too bad they are surrounded by what must be the family of the director. This is the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! The music was a little better than acting. If you get to watch this, I hope it's because there was absolutely NO other option! The sequel (yes continuation) arrives now .... I think that I will jump it! Jason
