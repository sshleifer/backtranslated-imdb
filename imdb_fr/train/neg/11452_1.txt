If I could evaluate this movie by 0, I would have it! I see people at IMDb say it's the funniest movie of the year, etc etc, excuse me? are you sniffing LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie N O T H I N G! In fact, I want to recover 27 minutes of my life spent watching this shit. <br /> <br /> I read that someone sitting on a plane was watching this movie, he stopped watching after 30 minutes. I fully understand that I would have actually watched snakes on a plane twice instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do anything else useful in life, do the dishes, walk your dog, heck ... everything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching a hot rod .
