Having decided some time ago to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films (based on class films like "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Was Not Here" among others), it was inevitable would be the strange turkey there. What I did not understand though was that there could be a bad CECI. I'll give you an idea of ​​the incredible poverty of this film - the funniest dialogue is as follows: "Toc Toc", "Who is there?", "The big stink man", "The big stinking man who? "," The big, stinking man - it's YOU! " Yes people, it's really so bad. Billy Bob only stays about two minutes (I guess he needed the job at this point in his career) and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason, although it is undeniably horrible, I do not hate it. This is probably because I keep my cool for any big budget, for loaded special effects like "The Fast and the Furious" and not for a "budget-free" movie like this. 2/10 to the push.
