Since the 1970s, screenwriter / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for hundreds of fiction, fantasy and horror films. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a small budget to the maximum; many of them are bad enough. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare jewels. <br /> <br /> A Terminator-like narrative of time and action, Trancers watched Tim Thomerson play Jack Deth, a future cop charged with tracking down the evil Whistler, who travels in the past living in the body of an ancestor. Whistler is able to control other human beings with his psychic powers, turning them into obedient zombies (the "transcribers" of the title), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future . Jack follows him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this sequel of 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman. who helped him succeed in the first film. But, for Jack, things do not stay quiet very long and trouble appears in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build an army of sharp edges. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering the quality of the original. The story is difficult to understand if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not long), and there is a host of unimpressive actions and some mediocre special effects. Finish the inventiveness and the spirit that made the Trancers so fun; Instead, we get a few one-liners and a scenario that seems to have been written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give to recommend this film to fans of the genre is the cast, which has many names that will be familiar to fans of sci-fi and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a day off when they were shooting Trancers II, and their performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has its fans; four other suites have since been published. Unless quality takes a massive upward momentum, I can not imagine it being good.
