Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. Not so much based on the director, who had not made a cinematic outing before, but more based on his casting. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (lead role in Double Body, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) have all played in great movies. Not together though, and this fact has not changed exactly because of this one. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that could make it slightly attractive is the choice of places on which it was shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this one.
