I have known the fantastic book of "Goodnight Mister Tom" for a very long time and it is only recently that I have had the chance to see this adaptation of it. I have heard many positive remarks about this and I had high hopes. Once this film was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor adaptation and practically 4.5 / 10 of the book was missed. In particular, I found that many characters and some great scenes of the book were not in this situation. There was not much dialogue, it was hasty and far too fast, but the fact that you never saw the bond and the love that united William Beech to Tom in this movie that really disappointed me really disappointed me. The casting was not very good either. I thought it could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! An extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. This deserves a decent remake that would be better than 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.
