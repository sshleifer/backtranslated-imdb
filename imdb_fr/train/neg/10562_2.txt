This low budget comedy film only succeeds in a reduced budget. Dialog is staggering, the pursuit scenes are consistently boring and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of collisions and explosions on a parking lot in the last five minutes of the movie (a brief preview of the film) At the beginning of this scene, it is certain that the sinking of the leader of the film will be destroyed and spit - no accessory is here without aim). The film as a whole is a depressing reminder of those who sometimes came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he gave a few dollars and a camera to a new director - but without the discipline that Corman would impose.
