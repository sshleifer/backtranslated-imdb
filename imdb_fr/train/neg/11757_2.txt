Hi Arnold! is a slow and slightly boring film. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) buys all decrepit and cheap buildings to build a gigantic shopping center, a shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many children's movies of the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of ​​seeing him as the villain is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with the secret help of Helga, whose father hopes to become rich through the center Shenk's Mall. Children must travel by bus in the city. The exciting prosecution scene involving a bus is not only silly, but it also highlights how this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, TV drawing is usually a lot of fun, and it has enough humor to please adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold, the movie is about five times more sedative and is a good way to put everyone asleep, including children. Hey Arnold was a tough guy to stay awake until the end predictable and totally boring. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, that's it. I have the impression that instead of trying to make a 90-minute film, the producers started with a 30-minute cartoon script for television and tried to extend it in 90 minutes. This shopping center story could certainly have been covered in the TV cartoon. Let's hope Arnold will bet a better writer if there is a sequel.
