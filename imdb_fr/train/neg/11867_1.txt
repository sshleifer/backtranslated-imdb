I did not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! And what aggravates the problem is that it is another Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a rock soundtrack years It is appalling, it is only getting worse, which is hard to believe. See how bad the beginning is (a skinned man, hanging upside down in a room covered with white tomato sauce?). <br /> <br /> And why do their accents keep changing? From bad New York drawl, to English prissy, then pure Australian! And that happens to all actors! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be a lie, because no one in the right mind would name it for nothing (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think that's too bad for that too). <br /> <br /> Come on guys! This film must be number 1 on the last 100 !!! It must be ten times worse than those movies already there. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the "producers" of this trash, for proving that there was a reason not to see movies ..... 0/10
