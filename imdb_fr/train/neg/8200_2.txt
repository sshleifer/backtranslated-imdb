This film could not decide what he wanted to be. There were some subplots that made you think for a while that all these things would come together at the end ... but they were not. If you want a story of "extraterrestrial in frozen waste", stay true to the 1950 version of THE THING (not the abomination that was redone in gore-o-vision 20 years later). <br /> <br /> I could not forget that the "extraterrestrial" looked rather recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY. <br /> <br /> The decorations "at a bare minimum" would have been more effective if they had hired actors capable of acting and reaching the expected ambience. <br /> <br /> Many chewy landscapes with little effect.
