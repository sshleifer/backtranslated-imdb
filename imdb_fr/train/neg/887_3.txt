Following the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to come together and make a similar anthology-style film based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes seem to come and go too fast - when you think you're going into a story, it's over in too many cases. And, often, start and stop then start again - with the stories woven together. As a result, no title indicates that a story is complete and that its structure is less formal. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, I Love You" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of "New York, I love you" was missed. Stories tended to be much sexier but also much less sweet - and often quite awful. It was an incredibly dull and uninteresting movie with only a few exceptional stories - and perhaps the often depressing music seemed even more so. Now, understand, it was good quality music but its dark tone really made me feel like I was cutting my wrists! Among the best, there was the story of the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to the prom, the couple talking cheating in front of a restaurant (although it was also in the first film) and the old couple very arrogant. All this is so sad because I loved the first movie so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried but I just did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent film, this was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included in the extras that are not included in the movie. One is Kevin Bacon (wearing a fresh fedora) eating a hot dog ... and NOTHING more for almost ten minutes. The other film features a teenager who spends the film filming the world, including a very unhappy couple.
