I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I did on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading interviews with the director, he says he respects constructive criticism. So I will try to avoid criticizing the film just for the sake of it and to give my opinion on why I found it catastrophic. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know the budget may not have been a big hit, but since Nicholson had been in the industry for more than a decade, he certainly knew at least some average players. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly lame makeup and special effects. Once again, the budget obviously interfered with what was originally planned, but after working for so many years, there is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities with Hostel. Although not exactly a scam, he certainly tries to take advantage of the success of the old movies. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Not at all scary or haunted not even disgusting just boring. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! In addition, the secondary intrigues about the theater and the guy who came to save them were weak and almost afterwards. <br /> <br /> 6. The assembly. WTF. How shocking, and not in a good way. nuf says. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the comments of the director on my message (he probably goes to his pages on IMDb.) because my friend ... what were you thinking. During filming or editing, you surely understand how a turkey was on your hands ... Sorry, I do not want to be hard, but you must have more talent than that. I hope your next feature film, Gutterballs or Wahtever is better, hopefully, practice is making progress. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, avoid it like the plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
