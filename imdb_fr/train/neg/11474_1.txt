This relic of a short film begins with a teenager trying to get a driver's license. All imaginable topics relating to cars are quickly lost. <br /> <br /> Topics such as buggies, drag racing, custom painting and auto shows are discussed. He often tries to be humorous but the film is at the same time dull, even sexist. None of the people in the movie are actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and comments. Sorry, but I can not stand this. <br /> <br /> There is nothing informative or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?" It's just another crazy filler piece to take the time out of their TV show "Wonderful World Of Disney". 1/10
