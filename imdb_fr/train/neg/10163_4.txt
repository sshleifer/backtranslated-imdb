Thinking of the revelation that the main character of "Bubble" has just ended, I remember "Machinist" Christian Bale last year. The only difference between the two movies is the actual physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A sober, but quite realistic portrait of the life of a small town. The title is a reason for contemplation. Maybe we, the public, are the ones who are in the "bubble", because the movies do not bring us any gain of 90 minutes. The reactions of the public were often sufficient and judgmental, clearly indicating how people can be detached from the slightest trace of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are the ones people call those who have reinstated George W. for a second term. their feet for the release as soon as the role of the credits. This film has its merits and deserves to be taken into account for things it does not say outright.
