The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that by looking for this movie and investing time to watch it, you put more effort into the experience than many of its directors, including director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> Peckinpah, already unstable, was preparing to deal with difficult weather conditions with this film. According to at least one biographer, this is where he became familiar with cocaine. Add to that its excessive consumption of alcohol and no wonder that things have collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is good and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and seem to be the best friends in the world. Something upsets their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows them blowing up a building - why are not we told exactly why? for the course in terms of cloudy motivation of this film. But the implication is that these guys hurt people and do not really care - the anti-heroes look a lot like Wild Bunch of Peckinpah not so long ago. An opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, and then adds in an obvious voice "... the thought that the CIA could use such an organization for any purpose whatsoever is, of course, absurd." It's a pretty smart way to let the public know that all bets are open. <br /> <br /> Add to that a strong and traditional Peckinpah cast including Burt Young, Gig Young and Bo Hopkins, a regular at Puminpah group, in the role of a plum fool who can not pass up an opportunity to get shot for 500 dollars a day, and you just want the writers, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, trying to do something more with the story to turn it into a platform for lazy - liners and bad imitations chop-socky. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social comment is clumsy. "You are so busy doing the dirty work, you can not tell who the bad guys are," someone in Locken said, as if he or we needed it. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the awkward direction of Peckinpah and its slow pace. We are in the film for 40 minutes before we had our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a group of people that we had not even met before find themselves trying to fight to the airport of San Francisco, their battle being interspersed with a conversation in an office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there remains the battle to compete in a fleet of Victory Ship, ninjas running short for slaughter while Caan is thrown to the ground. a lining that undermines any suspicion of real suspense. "Take me seven to five, I'll take the little guy," he said just before a climatic duel between samurai between two ninja warriors - from China, whom we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle is taking place in San Francisco, but surprisingly, no RCMP member comes in to break things.) <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering , remembers his bosses, interpreted by a sweet Arthur Hill, that he was "dropped in pieces" by the organization. Caan refuses to sit back, and his recovery scenes, although significant for the film, feature an excellent rendition of him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a nursing assistant. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s and his laconic play with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and the two Youngs gives "Killer Elite" a real visibility. <br /> <br /> But you do not watch "Elite Killer" think about it. You look at him thinking about the movie that escaped.
