This film has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop, the acting, the "noise" - and yet that's all it has. A certain "sense" of a Broadway without the bang. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, the photo is disjointed, the song "jumps" on you to remind you suddenly that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolerable: Sinatra's fianc√©e - her tone and the accent of her voice were useless. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Sir "I remember the numbers on my dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: the discreet song of Brando (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise : how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in his scenes of Havana. It's the bone structure! How I would have killed seeing Miss Leigh in a defiant role again Brando.
