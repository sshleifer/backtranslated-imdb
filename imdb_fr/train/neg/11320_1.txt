someone needs to pay for his car ... it's really awful ... gives the impression that the cyborg of Jean Claude is gone with the wind ... it's an hour that I would like to continue in justice to come back ... luckily, it produced a serious drowsiness ... from which I fell asleep. How can players of this caliber create this dog? I would rather spend my time watching the algae grow on the side of an aquarium rather than take part in this horrible concoction of several genres. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at walmart is way too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need it, wait until it's thrown away after taking it to inventory for several years and they're frustrated not to sell them. <br /> Please for God's sake let this movie die of darkness.
