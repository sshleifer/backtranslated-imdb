Ugh, what else can I say than, uh? I rented this movie because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires. This movie could not have been any lamer. Missing not only in the plot, but the acting is atrocious. Combined with obvious conspiracy holes, this movie is very difficult to watch. Many times, I wondered about my own mental health by continuing to watch the movie long after the plot had jumped up. Here's a sample of the aspects of lamer ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> "The professional killer" insists on sleeping outside at night. He wakes up in front of a weeping woman, not sitting more than three feet from him in the middle of nowhere. He will immediately comfort her without calling into question her sudden appearance. She's crying to seduce him, and he lets her do it with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters is Zoe, she was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experiences" pills "she had in Mexico, she is fine, even if the temperature of her body is below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> Guard outside the monastery where the hero goes the night is killed by vampires, the hero leaves the next day, then comes back a day later to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after his departure ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
