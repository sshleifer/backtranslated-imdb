This film was so predictable that you still hoped that the most obvious suspect would be innocent, and there is yet another big turn to come. However ... this is not the case. He just keeps on scare, and she keeps ignoring it. Mary found incriminating evidence at home and she still trusted him? And what was it to "start the trap"? There was no trap. She confronted him, he said "excuse me, I have to go kill someone" He left, and that was the end. They try to use other suspects (such as an older carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth and the frame is just strange ... lying around in a recycling plant? His agitation and nothing is well developed. For example: when she leaves her place after drinking beer, and he finds the photos and she runs out, he catches her and they end up having sex in this car ... -what it was? His reactions were not described. In the car, she was frightened as if it could have been practically a rape - but all we see is her shower the next morning. booooooooo It could have been so much better ... so much better.
