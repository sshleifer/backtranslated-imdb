This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The game was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears every second time is supposed to appear one night. The majority of the world's population has decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning, everyone, except for a small number of people, was turned into dust by the radiation of the comet. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been reduced to dust. No bones, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation cremate people if they do not leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Better yet, the comet has mutated some people into flesh-eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even seemed scary for a newborn. Insane Clown Posse scares me ... and they are supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared zombie-dom and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet supposed to cremate people? <br /> <br /> The horror music of the 60s, broadcast in the background through parts of the film, is also insulting. the film and makes you want to turn your television. <br /> <br /> The most stupid part of the movie, however, is about the characters he focuses on: Star Trek's Valley Girls and Chakotay: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would loot the day after an apocalypse with mutants eating flesh running everywhere? There were four five-minute horror scenes throughout the movie, and most were dreams. Between these scenes is an unsophisticated dialogue that gives South Park the intelligent appearance. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Do not see this movie, ever.
