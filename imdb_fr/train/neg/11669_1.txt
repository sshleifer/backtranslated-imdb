I guess it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a movie like this. With the sometimes useless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language and tacky one-liners. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and with lean and sparse landscapes. I am sure that they must have great meaning and insight, because the implicit message is shrouded in perplexity. The acting is mediocre ... bland and pedestrian ... and starring one of the worst scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit until the end). The landscape is dull and the ridiculously long end sequence of the girl walking in the arid park is as enjoyable as having a tooth pulled out. This is what I would call the anticlimatic, but as the film did not reach a climax ... not even in the "erotic" scenes ... it would be wrong. I'm sure a script was used during the shooting, but with the extent of the dialogue, I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film offers nothing that could interest or amaze ... no big story, no brilliant insight, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three fun moments, this movie is a loss of two hours. A tragically boring and dreary film.
