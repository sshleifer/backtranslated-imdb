What do you have in your head? This film is bad! Every minute I was bored more and more. I have tried to look at the end because I hope something will happen at last! But instead, I was amazed at how boring the end was ... What is this story about this damned "Bogeyman"? How is it that he does not die? He is a bloody human being for God's sake! A simple boy who killed his silly sister 15 years ago. So what? His stay in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is a fascinating stupidity ... It's a must of stupidity. I'll sell it right away to an idiotic guy who will understand this silly movie.
