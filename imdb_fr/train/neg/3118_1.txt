I felt that the film was dry ... very disappointing, no plot .. we were waiting for something to happen and nothing was drying like a bone .. a waste of money .. One of the worst movies of Robins Williams. If you do not believe me, wait a few months, the DVD will come out because it seems to be a model for movies that do not go well in movie theaters, because the movies rented before the end of the year. .. It's a movie you will not want to see anymore or say why I spent my money on it !. In addition, for the fact that it is a new film, there were only 8 people watching it ... It was a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that it needed a little more excitement or something to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were very low and you could not hear what they were saying.
