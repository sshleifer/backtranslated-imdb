Where do I start? According to the title of this film, I was expecting some degree of authenticity, in the end I was abandoned individually. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, it is rather a story of Hollywood (or the filming center of your movies) based on real characters. I should have had a clue hearing a strong English accent give the intro of the film in German; the blood red text (title, artists) should have been the second clue. The scenario is artificial (Lale was not deceived in Switzerland by the parents of Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside the control of the Nova Scotia regime, not under control, the disc played at the station was picked up in Vienna while the lieutenant was there on leave, etc., etc.) the costumes are mediocre and incorrect for the Timetables (SS black uniforms used everywhere daily use once the war started, etc.), the characters are stereo types (SA intimidated in a club once they were essentially out of power). Do not waste your time.
