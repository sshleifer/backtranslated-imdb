During the months leading up to the release of this film, you saw that it was advertised in all kinds of print media. So I waited patiently for his video output to see what all the hype was. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for having occupied the VCR for an hour and a half to watch such a horrible film. It basically fails because it is a character-based movie that can not be traded. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only recoverable quality is Amanda Peet), you can not bear any. The film is based on a sophomoric dialogue, weak and rude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric, whose portrait of the only married member of a group of friends is irreproachable. The last twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or have a sense of black humor.
