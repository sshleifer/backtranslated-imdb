It's probably the best horror movie ever since Ed Wood's death. <br /> <br /> I can not ruin the end because I do not know what happened. I will do my best, however. There is a kind of lesbian vampire, but they are constantly exchanging their bodies. So, any character may or may not be the one you are supposed to think, or maybe a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> That sounds confusing? It's not as confusing as one might think, because none of the characters makes sense to begin. There is no plot, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines, then disappear to never be heard again. There are also zombies, who are * probably * the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a dream sequence in a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe none of that happened, and that it's all the hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> The advantage? The two leading girls take off their shirt briefly. The special effects are just staggering (I particularly liked the incredibly slow and clumsy combat sequences). Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> Well worth the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
