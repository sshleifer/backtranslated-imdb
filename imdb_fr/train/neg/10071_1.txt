I saw this film during its premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since American Beauty was a film that had something to say, I had hope for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, many films I have seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance film for which I want to go out early. <br /> <br /> Towelhead's worst problem is that it obviously originated in a set of "provocative" concepts about cultural stereotypes, rather than in an organic human drama. The script is based on Alicia Erian's eponymous novel. The famous quote from Edith Wharton comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good despite its adaptation to the author's political views. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because his political views are so obsolete and simplistic. If there was a time when the ugly white men of Towelhead, the condescending representations of Blacks, the ironic treatment of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long been a long time. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please search for one of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all judge this film badly and expose the superficial and manipulative fabric on which it rests. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviews seem easier to understand. Reading the reviews of this site and similar sites, you will often encounter superlatives: "stunning", "breathtaking", "deep", "shocking" ... It bothers me to read them, but it does not Surprise me. Indeed, I have met many people who seem to consider any book or film dealing with racial, cultural, gender or sexual issues as deeply moving, provocative, deeply insightful. If you are such a person, of course, rent Towelhead and let it move. On the other hand, if you raise your standards, you can safely transmit it.
