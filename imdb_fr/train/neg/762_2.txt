Loyalty to Peter Falk was all that prevented me from giving this horrible image the (1) it deserved. (By the way, it was my loyalty to Mr. Falk that made me look at this movie from head to tail.) Even if you forgive all the blatant errors, it was simply the poorest excuse for a television made for you "Columbo" movie ever. I'm glad I watched it for free on TV. would have hated spitting money for an impression.
