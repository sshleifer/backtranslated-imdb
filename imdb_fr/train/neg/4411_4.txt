Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but his role is to direct except in a low-budget film. He really does not have a lot of charisma. Ryo Ishibashi is much more present on the screen and, unfortunately, he is not really the main character. Most of the time on screen goes to Rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (Halloween movies 4 and 5) plays her daughter. She is cute and fun, but she is written not to be too much One of her stupid and clever mistakes has one of the main characters killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst play interesting roles here. Watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliare in front of the local mafia godfather, and it's hard to say whether he works or not the film as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems to be in all action movies filmed at very low budget. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film gave the impression that it was a travesty. Is this a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to say at times. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The distribution of Thugs and Goons is threatening and well expressed. Some of these types of movies have thugs that look like the ones they work at the local comic book store or in stock at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this film is very uneven. At times, it looks like a comedy or a parody. At other times, it works like a good action movie. Then, it spits to the end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this film would award a zero in my humble opinion.
