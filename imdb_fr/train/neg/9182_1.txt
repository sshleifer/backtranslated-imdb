As everyone has said, the acting is awful, no story or other, a bad staging. As for the SFX, the 360-degree matrix-style shooting, one shot is pretty stupid, but for each character. I mean come give me a break. And what's up with all these video game scenes, just to remind us that this is a "video game adaptation"? Jesus, they should have fired anyone who thinks this idea. <br /> <br /> 0.00001 / 10
