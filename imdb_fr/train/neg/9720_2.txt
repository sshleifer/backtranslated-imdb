This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> He tries to copy some effects borrowed from an artistic director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I've almost never found very convincing), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is stupid , the end is ... stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I did not like a movie less since Christophe Gans' "pact des loups" (and I watch about 80-100 films a year), but at least this movie had action and a lot of good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here, and when I saw the rankings and comments, I thought I had to write Something wrong. <br /> <br /> I guess we will not have any problem selling the DVD that was offered to us: not so bad movie in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open-minded (I watch SF, westerns, dramas, comedies, silences, horror, fantastic movies ...), but this movie was so annoying that I felt like I had lost an hour and a half.
