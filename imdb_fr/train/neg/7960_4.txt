I rented it because the second segment traumatized me when I was little. One morning, I slipped very early on the stairs, I started watching HBO and The Raft (segment 2) terrified me. This time, I still enjoyed the Raft, although I can not say if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was a good short film. The other two segments were complete waste. I can not believe a producer paid somewhere to make this junk. All I did when I looked at it was to spoil one last childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will join Rad in my list of stained childhood classics. 4/10
