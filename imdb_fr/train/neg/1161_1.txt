As a cast member, I was a member of the group at all basketball games. I would like to let the world know after the movie that we did not have the right to see it because it was banned in Oregon. This is due to the producers and director who broke the contract with the University of Oregon where the film was shot. It seems that the U of O sign has been shown. During filming, we were allowed to have several meals with actors and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most evil men I have ever met. All the time for a 20 year old. But it's certainly not campus life in the late '60s and early' 70s, despite what Hollywood may think. Oregon Trombone Player
