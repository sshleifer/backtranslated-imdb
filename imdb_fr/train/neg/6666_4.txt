I really wanted to love this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to ruin this movie - do not worry from the beginning, you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this movie was. The Cowboy and "Twig" climb the ridge. The cowboy has a mustache handlebar. The Cowboy and "Twig" embark on a shootout and run halfway up. The cowboy is clean shaven for the rest of the film. Between the gun battle and the descent into the mountain, the cowboy had time to shave, in the dark, on the back of a horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the game of the four main characters is solid.
