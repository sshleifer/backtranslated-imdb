At least among movies with 100 or more votes. Nominated for the best script written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in lead role ?? Nominated for the best image ?? I still disagree with many of Oscar's choices, but this film could be the worst film ever to be honored by the Academy. The writing and the game were horrible. Blethyn's performance in particular is one of the worst I have ever seen and probably the most overrated performer performance of all time. Terrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and worthy of the cable or TV channels that have ever seen it, including HBO (where I saw it). I am only grateful that I did not pay to see one of the most overrated films of all time.
