For a comic writer, Woody Allen really leaves the viewer paying with this little attempt to develop the character. There are some fun moments, but no more than anyone else would have listened to their dry tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell wastes his time in this film that fails to showcase his usually amusing performance. Amanda Peet did well, but again, she did not have room to move in this film like a corpse. The film is so heavy and dull that it can not be worn, but if it did, Radha Mitchell would do it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that scroll through a scene and you do nothing, but show that their screenwriter can write some catchy dialogue lines on occasion, then you'll love this movie.
