Terrible movie made with a budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets were used, a mediocre actor game and a horrendous alien scenario that uses meat discarded from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an egg beater that replaces one of his hands. (Yes, you read that right.) <br /> <br /> A good grace was a song performed at the "talent show" (how is that ironic?) By a punk / new wave band that I think was called "I am a missile in search of heat". Other than that, it's not worth your time, not even on a level "so bad it's good". Watch if you like alien movies, but everyone should stay away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
