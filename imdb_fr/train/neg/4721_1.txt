Before viewing this film, please consult the Internet criticism of the falsification of events, including the fact that 7 to 8,000 Muslim men were taken from Srebrenica by Serbian buses and paramilitaries. The documentarian also belongs to various pro-Serb American organizations. Please watch this movie critically, and read reviews in advance. Most critics argue that the documentaryist pushes his arguments too far, even though he raises issues that focus on misconceptions about the war. Stephen Holden, who published an article in the NYTimes, says it would be "inaccurate to qualify this pro-Serb documentary", but it is appropriate to question the presentation of facts, many of which are drawn from reliable sources, to indict Serb forces. I do not advise to see this documentary, but I advise you to examine it with a particularly critical eye (as it is advisable to do it anyway).
