I have always been thrilled by vintage dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was amazing. Incredibly bad! The scenario was appalling, the acting was uninspired and all the characters were terribly tasteless. Apparently, Byron was "foolish and dangerous to know" and put all his heart into the ladies' hearts. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a small squirt tawdry jumped instead of a fiery female hero and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a limp. This portrait of the man was all soft. <br /> <br /> I watched the two and a half hours waiting for something that would bring life to life. Not a scramble, not even a glimmer. It was total boredom, if not complete boredom, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Having the opinion that no one will be better than Avon's bard, I also believe that Byron's poetry is too venerated and my mind should be thrown in the background, and this staging of his life should receive the same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its image with this one.
