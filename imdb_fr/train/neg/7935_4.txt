I bought this film blindly and I am quite upset to have paid as much as I do, but I would say that it is worth at least a rent for some cool dead and ludicrous acts. It's not a good movie, but I have to say I was pretty entertained. I guess it could be called so-bad-it's good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting is awful, I feel that I could have done a better job by showing, at least, any emotion. The story is not new and has been made better. I guess I just have a soft spot for a carnival type movie. I would say rent or download, but do not buy it. It's not worth more than a watch.
