*** THE REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS *** I will make this criticism short and sweet. I bought this film at Best Buy because it seemed interesting and some of the best actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were there. How could he be bad, right? Well, it's not bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a budding journalist who comes across a case that could lead to police corruption in Edison's police force. LL Cool J is Deed, a force policeman belonging to a special forces team called F.R.A.T. (First response assault tactics). He teamed up with a bad cop "on the edge" named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we see Lazerov & Deed attacking bank robbers, but at night, they blow up two or three guys who take drugs. I do not want to do too much, but things go wrong for the guys who take drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), is involved in a lawsuit involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects a criminal act and, with the help of Ashford, conducts an investigation that goes wrong. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford in trying to bring corrupt police officers to justice. <br /> <br /> You can see from the beginning that the performances of Freeman and Spacey are rather mediocre. The only person who gives a total performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a full-fledged case in this film and made me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says each line in the same way and shows almost the same emotion. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The film begins with a nice action, but then drags it into the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
