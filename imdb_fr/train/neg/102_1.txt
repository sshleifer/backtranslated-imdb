My girlfriend once brought the Zombie Chronicles so we could watch them as a joke. We did not know that the joke was for her for paying Â£ 1 for that. Watching this movie, I started to suggest things I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These included: <br /> <br /> 1) Bleach 2) Sand in my eyes 3) A letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) The Rebuilding of the American Civil War 5 ) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing to do was to break a door (the best part of the movie). This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I saw White Noise: The Light. Never has a movie had so many mistakes. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> News Fair in: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Made. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH
