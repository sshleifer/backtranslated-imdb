There are three types of bad movies: the cheap, the boring and the tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> Boring movies are just boring - if you do not go fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Tasteless films actually have their supporters; but the fact remains that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only cheap and bad movies are really fun, because filmmakers wanted to make their movies so desperately that they far exceeded their goals. capacities and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is naturally boring and tasteless; fortunately, the fate and the lack of financial resources and skills redeem it by making it seem cheap too. this film is hilarious and could be the last really funny-bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time in a theater, God forgive me; I laughed so hard that I rolled from my seat, and so did the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband, promoter, designed this film as, in part, a satire; unfortunately, the dereks clearly had no resources to do this; therefore, the "satirical" element emerges from a schoolgirl's impression of Frank Gorshin's impression, expressed by a young gay man, that Batman's guesser is trying to make him believe that he is Robin - he does not fly over our head, he has no idea where any human head could be. <br /> <br /> however, there are supposedly serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - that are so surprisingly tacky, one wonders if spoiled milk squirts in the eye. <br /> <br /> As for Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine a photographic exhibition of less erotic nudity, she's so weird with her broad shoulders, I can 'Do not imagine this that we have never seen in her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - as it is - well, it is not; Derek hunting in Africa and God only knows why. then his father - Harris - pretends to play in a manic puppet show, and of course there is the hunk'o'Tarzan who seems to have wondered in an advertisement without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he did not see scenario - apparently nobody did it. <br /> <br /> negligible camera work, mediocre editing - without the 3-way with the chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as is, it's a real joke.
