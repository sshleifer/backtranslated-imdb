I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, acting PITIFUL, real stupid criminals who were not even funny (at least funny) (unlike the first two home movies that were very good). all the pitfalls are weak and pathetic excuses for poorly copied ideas among the first two, which simply means that the people who write this movie were just lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This film is absolutely void, it is not even worth the rental. In fact, do not even look at it on the TV! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I hardly give this 1 star (out of 10). Believe me when I tell you right, if you liked the first two and you're not a stupid person, you will not like this film, do not watch this movie !!!
