A very old lady, desperate for money to save her house and property, cultivates pot in her house, smokes it with some very old friends and resells it. This is the story of this discreet comedy, which focuses on the absurdity of the situation and the humor provoked by the situation. For much of the movie, it works. Humor is not the type to laugh loudly but it amuses you for an hour and a half, so I guess it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the end has really spoiled a "cute" movie with insulting messages that only ultra-liberals in the film world would want to see happen. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but not everything should be hot and fuzzy for those who blatantly violate the law. There are also (1) typical children out of wedlock, but this is not a problem and is considered correct; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak persons; and (3) even a doctor who is being stoned too! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the critics here are exploding Hollywood? This is Exhibit A illustrating how a secular society has lowered standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people have at least a trace of morality instead of a message from Timothy Leary: "If it makes you feel good, do it."
