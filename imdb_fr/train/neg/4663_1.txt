This movie was just bad. I like war movies and I can normally get out of most movies and find something that I liked, but it was not. This film lacked substance and intensity. I understood it, the Finns fought well and it's great, but the story is poorly told. You have no real connection to any of the characters and there is no real scenario to follow. You just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be told. If you want a war movie that will keep you going and pretty amazingly without battle scenes, then I suggest "Downfall" (German WWII film). Or if you prefer a good story and a lot of action, I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean movie). These two movies will not let you down like Winter War.
