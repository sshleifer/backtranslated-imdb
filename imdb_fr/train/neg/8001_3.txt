MONSTER - He was great. I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Creature from the Black Lagoon". The scenes with this wandering beast on the land and capturing people go from good to staggering. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENT: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as doctors (under the orders of the government) state that the disease resembling SARS already exists. In a nutshell, we have the history of well-known government concealment. You know, I expect the paranoid spirit of the liberals with the Hollywood movies to paint our government of corruption, but it seems that the Koreans copy the format, which is very tedious. Here, it removes the excitement and suspense of this "monster". This drags the film. The main family featured in the film must look away, while the girl of their family, presumed dead, was taken away by the creature. <br /> <br /> MORALE: a guy "does not pollute the water" "message because that's what can happen - a horrible mutated monster.It was the message of the anti-nuclear bomb years 1950, when radiation caused giant ants, spiders, fish or something else in these schlocky sci-fi movies, now it's "environmental issues" that are at the center of concern. <br /> </ br> > HUMOR It was kind of stupid, I normally laughed at slapstick, but it was not funny, I do not know if the Korean sense of humor is so pitiful, or if the movie was deliberately trying to become ultra-corny by resuming the old movies of "Godzilla" Hope this is the last one. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The video transfer was good, it was a sharp picture and the sound was ok with a lot of noise. the crowd through the rear speakers.I watched this in Korean with English subtitles. perhaps a mistake, because the Korean guttural voice became annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL - It was a promise that turned out to be a big disappointment and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern monster movie. Two hours were way too long for this story. I do not know how this movie drew record crowds in Korea. They do not have to have a lot of movies to enjoy and support.
