This film seems to have been made by someone who had good ideas, but who had never made a film before and who had never considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and I assumed, wrongly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about control of the mind and so many flat, not funny moments. And, to top it off, Candy spoke some of the most raw lines I'd ever heard until that time. So, despite a potentially funny story and cast, we end up with a rude and amateurish movie that will probably be too stupid for an average adult, although teens are probably happy with it. It's a shame - it could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy, that should have been wonderful.
