Go guys some previous comments have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60s TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable because of the most serious girl (Yeoman Barrow) never used on Star Trek and because it was shot in a real outdoor place. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, which were totally confined to sound scenes. <br /> <br /> This use of an outdoor place (and a babe) gives adequate depth and almost cinematic quality to a rather ordinary episode of this and very familiar show. <br /> <br /> With a few notable exceptions, namely "The city at the limit of always", "Earth assignment" and "Tomorrow is yesterday" The old series of Star Trek must be seriously set Seriously -balled and put out of his boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes out of 79 represent a mediocre batting average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring material that Gene Roddenberry produced at the time, contrary to popular belief that some people worshiped the soil he walked on, he actually did a lot of trash! It does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Irwin Allen, for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the entire bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor, plastic-backed cafeteria chairs, and inexpensive cardboard above the dashboards. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Every expense saved or what!
