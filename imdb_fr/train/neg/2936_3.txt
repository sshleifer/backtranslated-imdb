I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) attributed to this film and I was very disappointed. I had just seen two good foreign films and I was eager to do three in a row, but that was not the case. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much intrigue, if any. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but he has to entertain me or bring me back. The best I can say is that this film aspires to be an altman-esque movie, even if its set is extremely small. Of course, there are moments, but a few moments dissolve easily in 97 minutes slow of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this movie. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
