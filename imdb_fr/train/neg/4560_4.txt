Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment to me. Although the actors have done a very good job, especially Smith, there is no cure for a mediocre scenario once in production. The movie really had a "sequel" feel, playing partial events from the first movie. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. This was not well thought out and sometimes seemed very unstable and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB organization had some kind of "elite" force. You had some special agents and the feeling was "clandestine". In the following, the MIB organization has a JROTC Summer Camp atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The film was not great, it just lacked the "freshness" (lack of a better expression) of the first film. movie. Much of the same humor has been recycled from first to second and adds no originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 of the first 3 films. Was it decent? Yeah. Is he worthy to wear his title? Not really.
