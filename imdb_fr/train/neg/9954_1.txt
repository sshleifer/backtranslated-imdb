From start to finish, this is the most emotionally overwhelmed movie about NOTHING I've ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the main character and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The race track in metaphor is so overexploited that it gets closer to the clich√©. However, director Pollack sees every hairpin bend as a profoundly important task. scenes, such as Pacino putting his inner wife in touch, for the value of goof. But even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
