Go instead to the zoo, buy peanuts and feed them to the monkeys. The monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who do not say much, sit empty-eyed are not funny. <br /> <br /> A black comedy? There is no black, no fun. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these items one way or another and places them on their wallet. It's labeled unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken other things too, who knows? All we know is that whatever they come out, there is no more. <br /> <br /> The actors' game seemed correct to me. There are many unfathomable. It's supposed to be a city? It's supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church, people blossom, why do they all wear a coat?
