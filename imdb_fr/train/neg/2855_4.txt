"Mad Dog Time" ... "Happy Trigger", no matter what you call it ... just does not succeed. Maybe it's just me, maybe I do not like Gangster comedies (as I thought that Oscar, Johney Dangerous and Mafia were also void), it's probably more "a pun witty "than all comedies, only if it's not as witty and keen as that (or the other critics) do it. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old at first. It was sometimes painful to watch him running. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes of place or sensation for the period in which they were supposed to be. The majority of the film took place in the "Dreyfus Club" or in a variety of offices / dark rooms. .. (What was going on with this thing on the opposite side of the seated gun Goldblum continued to win?) <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution was ... on excellent paper (good to see Silva & Drago), but the characters were killed before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a joke! Romanticism and love of the film also prevented him. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll come back soon.
