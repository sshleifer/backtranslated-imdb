It was a disappointing horror movie about an arrogant girl and her nightmares. For a horror movie or "thriller" and a hype, it's much too tame. There are only a few moments of tension here, not as much as a film like this should have been. Even these "tense" scenes were not numerous. The music made them more dramatic than they really were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, so elitist critics call this movie a "horror movie for a thoughtful person". Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion as me: a waste of money at the video rental store. <br /> <br /> Summary: a stick that offers a main character that is not appreciable. and generally mediocre acting. Really overrated and certainly not what is advertised.
