The comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by praising this timeless classic. Speaking of speed, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff quarreled to determine who can find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie, some songs and some clothes were fake. There were sneaky references like "they paved paradise to set up a parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to make us smile, but basically made me moan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are incredibly clever politically and socially for teenagers. Almost as smart as people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the movie. Very little of what the characters said was credible. Combine bad writing and bad play, this movie fails completely. There were two exceptions, but Kelli Williams animated things as a future flower child and, despite what another reviewer had said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Showing this dark feature that would reach its peak when it appeared in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
