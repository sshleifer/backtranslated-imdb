I do not remember seeing another movie about murder and the mystery as serious. This film, about a medical examiner who investigates the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident, has the complete recipe for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, bad mood and no drama . I remembered watching this movie on PAX, a television channel known for its distribution of low-budget, up-to-date television movies like this one. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or suspense as big-screen movies. But, this movie certainly touched all the acid tastes. The directors of this film missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great TV movie; the title offers a bit of suspense. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie alone can kill the appetite of your television. <br /> <br /> Grade F
