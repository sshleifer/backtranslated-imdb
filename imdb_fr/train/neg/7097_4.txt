This film has an inexorable low price of class B in all its scenes, its effects, etc. to make you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching Wing Commander movies after Star Wars (regardless of content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And oh my God, I do not remember a villain so uninteresting for a very long time. We are not given any reason why he is so mean (an inherent flaw, we are led to think :), nor any real conviction nor any flair for his wickedness. <br /> <br /> If you want to go out rather Connery rent 'Chasse Forrester'.
