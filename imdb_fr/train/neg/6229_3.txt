First, let's clear things up: a) I'm a fan of cartoons has always been a fact (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in kindergarten). b) I like a lot of B movies because they are hilarious. c) I really like Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Let's move on, when the movie starts for the first time, it looks like it's your usual B movie, right up to shit FX, but all of a sudden- BOOM! the anime arrives! That's when the film won WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is VERY bad and not expensive, even worse than I remember SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie I remember "hotly" is when a group of kids come out of school ... and they're the same kids who come back again and again! The FX are terrible too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition between animation and animation is not organized, dialogues and voices (especially the English dubbing I watched) were horrible and I begged my father to remove the tape from the DVD player / VHS; The only thing that allowed me to survive was to make jokes and comments such as Robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to just enjoy this film and survive it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I intend to show it to another of my friends from otaku to Halloween for a B- Movie Night. Because it's stupid, painful to look at and involuntarily hilarious at the same time, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I originally wanted to give. <br /> <br /> (Based on my rating scale: 3/10 means almost both boring and bad, as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of him, it will be as much fun as counting to 15.)
