As an impressionable 10-year-old, I loved the philosophy of "love conquering everything" of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy about the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic teacher (Meredith Baxter) and the two parent groups (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald, parents of Bernie, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as parents of Bridget) who have problems with the interdenominational marriage of the young couple. <br /> <br /> Looking at the show now with years of personal experience, I am amazed by the fact that the show has been a success, although the season is highly rated. Created by the famous writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the cancellation of the series was to write the hit song "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light and superficial comedy that collapsed under her own aerial weight. <b> It was not impossible to deny the real chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in recent years, the two actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his ephemeral role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here, they were trying to bring to life a show that required a much finer comic strip, which could have given more depth to the complications of a very controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The show aired on Saturday night between two CBS stations. : "All in the family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". These two series were intelligent, funny and quite boring (more so than the others), which allowed me to keep my interest for the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and had only a few casual laughs. <br /> <br /> It was another example of a show that was really not as good as in my memories.
