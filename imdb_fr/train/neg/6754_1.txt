The only reason I'm bothering to comment on this movie is to save you every 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it off rent for Â£ 3.00. I tried my luck. <br /> <br /> In a few minutes, I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast should be stowed until winter, then thrown on the nearest wood fire, where they could meet more. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (screenwriter and director), it should be Unfortunately, it should have been done before he throws out this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in the shops you escape. <br /> <br /> 1/10
