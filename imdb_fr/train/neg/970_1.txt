Normally, I'm not one to be afraid of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. Some how this movie came into my mind !!! It is a very simple film but extremely effective, it has a very good atmosphere and it leads to shocking moments. Another view was the family photo, I did not expect that and jumped out of my seat !!! I recommend everyone to see this movie. With the light off, he will stay long with you !!!!!
