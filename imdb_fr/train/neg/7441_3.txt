To quote the movie, "Better not to know, better yet, forget, better still, be abandoned." Oh, irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror movie, but a horribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel like you're preaching the beginning . <br /> <br /> It's as if the cumulative dialogue of the characters of the writers could be summed up by a bad televised cop and a show by Jerry Springer. Maybe a movie like The Hitcher, not a horror film shot in Russia. The result is that a potentially awesome framework and some potentially great gory scenes are wasted and just become idiotic, not scary or meaningful.
