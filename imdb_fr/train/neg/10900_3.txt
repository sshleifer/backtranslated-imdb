You can not really hold back against that knowing that it was done in four days and I was expecting it to be campy anyway. (It's not quite campy in reality, with the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it half-way, Riley Smith is exceptionally bad. The ridiculous story is really paid attention to what shocked me a bit; I thought the purpose of these low-budget horror movies was to respond to the vilest sexual fantasies and make fun of the story, but they used a lot of words like "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their point across. (Although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there are so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this stupid plot, and the only interesting things in the movie are the mockery of the sects and soft-core homoerotisms are not so upset). I would have liked it better if there had been only a few random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a look of quality TV and quality. There are some "sexy" scenes that are going well - the boys are writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling awake; or being tied up and making orgasmic grimaces while pouring wine - and some of them are a little funny. And I loved L. Ron Hubbard's digs and the irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense homosexual overtones, but it's still not good. 3/10
