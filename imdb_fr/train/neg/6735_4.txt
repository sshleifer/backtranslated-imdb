The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is well paced. He did not fall flat. The other best things are the supporting performances of the actor playing the groom Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to criticize Messing's potential outfits in an early stage brings a delicious quality that is both absurd and winning. Ok, it's on the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable that he expresses his disdain for Messing than in any scene where he tries to do business or support. As others have noted, he does not seem to have invested emotionally in this venture, other than to close it as soon as possible. On the contrary, Messing sincerely tries to make the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She's enough to do it, but just is not strong enough as an actress to succeed without help. Give him an "E" for the efforts and a "C +" for the achievements. Given Mulroney's indifference, the act that could have helped Messing would have been a brilliant cavalier performance of the actor playing the role of his ex-fiance, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, meowing, and irreproachable. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this one further, I would obviously be more careful than most people involved. It's pretty harmless to spend time if you have nothing else to do and less odious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you'd better look again at "The wedding of my best friend".
