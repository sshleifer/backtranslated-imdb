This film is even a big step forward compared to the typical rate offered by Bollywood. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, becomes completely naughty. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And despite all efforts, women leaders fail to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects while Fardeen Khan seems stuck in the same price for the moment. But this monstrosity is even below his limited capacity as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in badly written clich√© roles. It's high time for Indra Kumar to hang up his director's hat. I hope he never directs another horror like this. The future of Hindi cinema is in better hands now. To sum up, stay away from celluloid waste.
