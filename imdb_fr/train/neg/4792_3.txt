Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... uh ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to defend this film, I just can not. The film seems to have "sold". The first bad signs occur when the video starts with trailers for other movies (which the others did not have). Also too many useless characters, like the kid (who is a sniper, funny at first but soon you want to see him die), the woman who uses karate to fight bullets (it will not work or rather should not ) and the zombies in bloom (what the hell are they doing there, there is no connection with them in the other Phatasms). In addition, it is cruelly lacking miniatures. <br /> <br /> The only good things are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER possible coming soon) <br /> For me, this movie seems to be a charge between the II and IV, the extra characters just leaving in the end to be able to continue with the 4 main in IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, VERY disappointing. 3/10
