Typical action-movie formula: A good cop is entangled in a jumble of crooked cops and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> The result gives decent performances, fleeting moments, as well as honest action sequences - plus a chance to take a look at the gorgeous Danielle Harris - who makes the most of of her perpetual conversion as a rebellious adolescent girl. <br /> <br /> ** on ****.
