PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY FULL NOTICE. I do not hit the movie itself - only the DVD versions currently available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film two stars. I mean, how could he rank just 1 in 10!?! <br /> <br /> Here's how: An epic cinematic adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the Red Army, and an extremely faithful adaptation of the novel, scene by scene would be difficult, but deserve to be followed for seven hours - if that's what you see. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see this movie - anywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch the DVD version of RusCiCo - widely considered the best version available since it contains a mailbox and restores scenes cut from other versions of DVDs. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst film prints I've ever seen on DVD. The photo is muddy and incoherent, often stroboscopic. It is almost tolerable that you maximize your brightness, your colors and your image .... but the problem does not stop there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also very incoherent, loud in some parts, virtually inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And in terms of languages, it's a HUGE problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has good actors, and some very terrible ones, including performance grids and some parts of the film are simply not doubled. , fall back into Russian and even French at random. <br /> <br /> The subtitles option is not much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but just above, masking some of the beauty (or what's left of it) of the scenery. In addition, subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame given that the script took the trouble to get closer to the lyrics of Tolstoy), and the subtitles also seem to disappear in places. <br /> <br /> Thus, even if you maximize the color, brightness and image settings, increase the volume of the sound and choose the English subtitles * and * doubled, you will get a boring movie to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Can we overcome the content? He could have done it, but at seven o'clock - who can stand it for so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday, someone will come and restore it - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but for now, I just can not give more from a star to something that I could only watch for the first 12%.
