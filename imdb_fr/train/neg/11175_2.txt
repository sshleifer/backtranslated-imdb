Unless someone enlighten me, I really have no idea what this movie is doing. It looks like an image with a message but it's far from it. This film tells the useless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that's all. When Pacino plays this agent, it must be thought that it must be something important. But we must not think to understand how this film is meaningless and dull. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone") who deserves the title "The most boring and useless film of the year". So what's going on, Al?
