We all knew that even before it was released, Ron Moore's mini-series was not Battlestar Galactica. It is very good. It simply means that it must be autonomous. He can not rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it's good, it's good on its own merit, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, that's what Moore wanted. However, if his mini-series rots, he shamed all the excellent actors who played on the screen, not to mention the myriad of off screen staff. And here is what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a remake. I would not even call it a reinvention. It's a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not happen in the Galactica universe, with the same places, the same jargon and the same technology. He does not talk about Galactica's research of the thirteenth tribe. Nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that have underpinned Galactica. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space opera, an action movie with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just another" space opera, action movie. Because the intrigues go, it has little original, or even interesting. I could tell you everything without warning of spoiler. But I will not inflict it on you. I'm just going to hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything in history. <br /> <br /> Yes, the creations of the man turn to the man and seek to destroy it. (I guess they've forgotten Azimov's rules again.) They look like humans, so there's alien stuff all over us. At least there is no trip back in time. Oh, and a lot of scenes of fights and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore appealed to Galactica, this ceremonial head sign, he appeared more cheesy than respectful. I mean, could not he even imagine something of his own? <br /> <br /> From the first minutes, I wanted to look at something else. I did not care about any of Moore's characters, since I could not identify with any of them. This fact struck me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not care. What a depressing thing. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, instead stood in line and saved their own buttocks. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They chose the security solution, rather than risking their lives to defend others. At least, disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But in the end, Ron Moore's mini-series was just a scoreless activity, a movie on a treadmill, still running and never going anywhere. And I just wanted it to be over. And in the end, my life force was sucked up to me. Against my will, I turned into a soulless and soulless zombie, probably of the type that this mini-series could appeal to. I had to rebuild myself. I needed - and I swear it's true - I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And more happy.
