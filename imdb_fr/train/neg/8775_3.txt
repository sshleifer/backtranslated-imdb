LOC could have been a very well done movie about how the Kargil War was fought. he owned the locations, the budget and the skills needed to be the "Ryan Rescuer" or "Black Hawk Down" of India. Instead, it sounds like a 4 hour bother trying to merge the war movement with the masala movie. Even the scenes of war have been terribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes and devoting unnecessary time to informal discussions. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, a better film would have been a full account of what had happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even an incursion into the militant point of view (like "Torah, Torah, Torah"). Better still, a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma could have written, directed and edited the film. Until then, I would like to see someone reissue this movie, with only the relevant portions included; it would make the film more watchable.
