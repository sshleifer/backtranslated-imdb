Forget Plan 9 is the ultimate fiasco, a costumed drama, poorly directed, scripted, interpreted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-good novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons are struggling to overcome such a dreadful scenario. Many mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow on Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of this misnamed "magical realism", it stands out as the worst movie of all time. It's totally bad !!!
