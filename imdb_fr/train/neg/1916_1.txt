This movie is totally trash. Some foolish intellectuals comfort themselves by doing their best to claim the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing more than a piece of catharsis of convenience. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this kind of film is shot in the United States, it's a big joke. And just because he's coming out of the "other side", it's a masterpiece, a wonderful distraction for some washed and / or washed Westerns (George W. maybe: ). A typical aftermath of the cold war, a kind of joke anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this - as expressed in this film - was all that the Soviet intellectuals thought all these years, maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim to have gone through. BUT NO! Because, like many others, I have read and seen real masterpieces made by truly exceptional Soviet intellectuals. For example, something that also concerns the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - the book by Gavriil Troyepolsky and the film by Stanislav Rostotsky - is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true sadness, true pride and true dignity, one of the best in the Soviet era.
