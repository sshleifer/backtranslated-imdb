The movie seemed to please me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was irrelevant and not as interesting as the other films. It was a waste of time and money. The same cheesy humor and cliche wicked. The movie was of no use if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The film should not be associated with anime like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The design and settings are not up to the standards of the original anime. It's a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet that Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and will give up Pokemon. Digimon is no longer an anime and is not close to Pokemon. His second film will be released at the end of 2002.
