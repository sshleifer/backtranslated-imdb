You know that you have a hard time watching a comedy, while the only fun parts of it come from Animal's cast. It is unfortunate that the Cat & Dog parrot is a support and not the other way around, because the humans it contained were rather abominable. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what kind of name is that), Jason and Lindsay, I would forget this lark and do something else, because you're all as funny as to watch the paint dry and terrible actors to start. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is funny as if you were not, you could change your mind if you were to bear the three authoritarians, tedious and dare I say The worst film I've seen in years and, hopefully, never see it again, although I do not hope so.
