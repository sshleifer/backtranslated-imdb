I am a horror film / gore maniac and this film was so terrible that I felt embarrassed not only for the "actors", but also for the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually invested his money in this campaign. <Br/> <br /> According to the title, you can expect a great carnage, a scenario and at least a direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like an episode of Three Stooges slightly more violent and sexual. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While watching this shit, I turned on another television and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept looking at Stern. <br /> <br /> Watch this "movie" I realize that I could produce a movie with three monkeys, two DV cameras, 50 dollars in a coin and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to enter the production of films without budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there are not many things here, but a lot of talk and very little action. This gives "KaZaam" to a film by Meryl Streep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany has not banned that because of her sex or her violence. Other countries must take this into account.
