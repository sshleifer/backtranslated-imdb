This film became extremely silly when things started to happen. I do not care about all the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the main actor (forget her name) also pissed me off. I do not really remember how it ended, etc., but the very idea that aliens have a human body and that everything seems stupid in this film, things did not go well. My father told me it was a stupid movie ... I should have listened to it.
