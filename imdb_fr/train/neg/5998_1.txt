The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, bring the public to love him, then put him in mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964 and 1968. <br /> <br /> Now, we are 40 years old in 2004. We meet Alan Tracy, a diligent college student, with his friend Fermat, a young man of the kind. . Lady Penelope takes them in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the paradise island where the Tracy family lives for the school holidays. Almost immediately, they are entrusted to Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults will rescue John from Thunderbird 5, who was damaged by an accident. It's all part of The Hood's plan to take control of Tracy Island so they can steal the Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> ?? To steal a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is as soft as that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the wooden game is more wood than the puppets (fiberglass), the effects, anything but special and the score of Hans Zimmer ??? Barry Gray's little glorious theme was reflected in Zimmer's dull orchestration. The rest of the score was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the score was broadcast on the radio the following week and did not recognize it! I did not even bother to stay to witness Busted's mediocre efforts with the final titles. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked very well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material, they could have been exhibition plugs. CGI's work was what I would have called advanced treatment - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main profession was simply wrong; The models of the original series have at least moved as if they had mass. <br /> <br /> Another sore point is that the entire production seemed to be a long series of product placements, from every vehicle built by Ford to its entire content. the Tracy Freezer being produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son enjoyed the film, but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', aimed squarely at his age group, adds nothing to the Thunderbird legend. . When Star Trek was screened on the big screen in 1979 with "The Motion Picture", a new breath was breathed into the franchise, which then continued for about 20 years. With this film, Frakes missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, like "The Avengers" and "The Saint", will sink into darkness. within 6 months, leaving the original series to its "classic" status.
