I noticed that "Fire" was on the cable the other night and I started to watch it because I could not remember anything more, except that I remember being a horrible film when I I saw it in 1985. Twenty years later, the film is still as appalling. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most used instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as shown in the title track. Hearing this song again made me want to put a screwdriver in my ears to put an end to the sonic misery that had been inflicted on them. And to compose this musical assault, the character of Rob Lowe played the saxophone, and there was a scene where he played a solo that continued as if it were Charlie Parker, only his high pitch and his game were reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were extremely unattractive, although I must say they did a great job in naming unattractive actors. In fact, I thought that Mare Winningham was attractive, and at first I felt sorry for her character because she was wearing funny underwear, but she decided to make love to the character of Rob Lowe to the end of the movie. sexual diseases if such a thing has been voted.
