How could actors as talented as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet have been involved in such a ... a ... such a thing? I can not get it. It was horrible, very baldy (but some of the few main roles), the jokes are silly and absolutely not funny ... I will not speak more about this film, except for a little advice: Do not go see it will be a waste of time and money.
