(There are spoilers) Miya's homosexual whore Kari, Kari Wuhrer, takes back the life and car of 18 virgins, even if he is too embarrassed to admit it, sticky college freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the film, Myia not only deflates, but also gives poor, innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to spot a dangerous job and stay as far away as possible for him or herself, so avoid turning into one. <br /> <br /> While resting around a truck stop, Miya is led by Roy, Burt Young, for a hot and painful action in the back of her buggy. Roy is either too drunk or too stupid to realize that Miya is none other than his separated daughter! Outraged by the fact that Miya is reluctant to do so, Roy strangles him almost to the death, but is interrupted by the first-year student of collage, Trent Colbert, who enters the rest area by sweeping the one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her luck, Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two are aloof in what turns out to be the strangest pursuit ever conducted in a movie. Throughout the northeastern United States, the two men find themselves involved in a truck collision with a soldier and a shootout with state soldiers who then head to the home of Trent's parents, where they are caught. hostage. This is where there is another wild shootout between crazy Miya and a whole SWAT team backed up by local police and US soldiers. <br /> <br /> You can expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentionally or not funny, but that's not the case. In fact, the film is very disturbing in the way Miya treats everyone in the film because she even gets in touch with her perverted father and child molester, Roy. To get Trent to drive her to the northeastern Northeast, Miya gets drunk in the poor slob's motel with handcuffs and a burning candle. Miya also gets along with the owner of the motel, the horny Mr. Foster, by inciting him to give his weapon, thus being part of a strange sex game. After holding Foster standing, she goes with Trent, who goes out into the room of his motel, his wallet containing about $ 400.00, but does not bother to leave with his car. <br /> <br /> Need the money to pay for gas to find her parents at Thanksgiving, Trent gets a call from Miya on her mobile phone to pick her up at a local restaurant to get her money back. Like the moron he is, Trent picks up Miya, who is now a fugitive from the law, and later mingles with his father Roy on the highway as he tries to scare Trent and Miya away. <br /> <br /> The hunt ends in this deserted house that Roy pursues for Miya, chasing him on a muddy road, in high heels, with him to get her into the you know where with a breath of his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he had forgotten he had left his gun unattended. <br /> <br /> The two desperadoes stop at an S & M / Tattoo shop where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and dresses with both a robbery and a murder, as well as that a hit and run. leather and chains, from Myri, with a matching dog collar. This is to meet his right and conservative parents for Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> Having a shootout with the state soldiers, one of them seriously injured, the two fugitives of the law are found at the parents of Trent, Mr. & Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn at the local police with a SWAT team were waiting for them. <br /> <br /> Nauseating film with a really disturbing ending that led you to wonder what the film was trying to do, if at all, to tell its audience. At first, you felt a lot of sympathy for Miya, but the end of the film was dark, and its end evaporated as fast as a tray of ice in the Valley of Death. Although Roy was the most unlikely person in the movie at the end of the film, Miya had totally overshadowed it.
