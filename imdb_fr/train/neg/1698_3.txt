Lynch. The man has very good things! He knows how to bother us, then reward us by making us think in different ways. This, however, is quite different. Dumbland's reward is a 1% absurd comedy, deserved by 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4, I started to look fast ahead. Did not miss anything. I felt relieved at the end, and that's part of the story of this series. It's a boring series about boring characters in boring situations, supplemented by an animation, voices and boring sounds. But to recognize this and its other absurd qualities still does not make Dumbland worthwhile.
