The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Subtle patterns, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preached, overtly obvious; why the original was a classic? The black charger was cool, but even that could not save this movie. Why stick to a white Challenger? I did not think it was the best choice in 1971. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend was beside him. Vigo was wearing only his white briefs. I'm sorry - it looked ridiculous - to watch the vista in Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was in the end - after the explosive crash of the bulldozers - the announcer said the impact was set to 180 mph. He then mentions that the police claimed that his remains had not been found because he had vaporized, but some people think he was saved by a bail and were hidden by friends in the crowd. Then he sees him get out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you could not open the door of the car at 180 mph. Second, the car would not continue to drive in a straight line for 100 yards. with no one to direct it. It would roll quickly about 30 times. Third, if you reach the pavement at 180 mph, you will end up with several spongy pieces. No matter, we see him at the end, standing with his daughter. In the end, a film that insults anyone's intelligence.
