The small Californian town of Diablo is in the grip of a mysterious death after Sheriff Robert Lopez found an old box. The sheriff's girls, Dominique and Mary fight against a bloodthirsty and bloody demon. "The Legend of Diablo" is an absolute hogwash. I'm a big fan of independent horror movies, for example I liked "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge miss. Without a doubt one to avoid.
