If you have seen very few movies, this could be a big deal for you. If you have seen a lot of movies, it's a joke. The game of real heroes is very badly described. Not to mention, there are songs, there is a lot of flashbacks and, more importantly, the fight scenes are executed stupidly. New characters, good management, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood heroes / heroines, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they convey are terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. It's supposed to be a realistic movie, but it does not show. You sometimes wonder that thousands of army vehicles are full of moving soldiers and that the Pakistanis are bombarding them and that none of their bombs are hitting them. Are the pakis really bad for aiming or the director has made them look stupid? There were only a few characters who played very well, but as for the plot, the action, it is badly directed. This film could have been short if it had released songs, flashbacks, stay true to the essential.
