This violent film contains very good ideas that, if executed clearly, could have made it go from spaghetti-western blandness to something special. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst published movies imaginable! The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for long periods, the performances (and the accents) of the actors are rather contradictory, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary who, after taking part in erasing a village, remains to become a priest (!) ... ten years later, the village is led by the "mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens comes looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau comes in search of Shaw. They scream MUCH and shoot each other a lot. Fernando Rey is there too (as a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are powerfully unequal. Savalas sometimes has an accent, just like Landau (who really knocks here). Shaw and Rey prove that they are unable to embarrass themselves and Stevens looks rather cunning (even if he is a little out of place among the sweaty dirt).
