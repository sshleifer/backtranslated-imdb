This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that is not extraordinary. A series of crimes, the killer you do not see throughout the film, the classic investigations. And also the classic story of a policeman who understands what is happening and no one believes, so he must fight alone to reveal the truth. Not too much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10
