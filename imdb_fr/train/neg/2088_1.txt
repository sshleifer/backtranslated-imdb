What a horrible sight. Sci-fi fans seem to be watching nothing, no matter how good they are. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts a season, while garbage like the remake of Battlestar Galactica gives rise to a rotation. This spin-off is pitiful in all aspects of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of anything that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series. The story is bad. Dialogue is worse than a soap opera in prime time. The direction is bad and the scenery is awful. Caprica is a loss of film, a waste of time and effort. It's a spin-off that should never have been done.
