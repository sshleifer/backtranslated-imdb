Another movie with an interesting premise and beautiful special effects falling in the trash. <br /> <br /> Boring direction and performance (with the exception of the charming Annabel Schofield who is much more cute as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the always serious Charlton Heston) deserve the approval of a real stinker. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see Heston behave at his usual height and show how bad this movie really is. He even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested, just to see how he related to the main line of the film. The way they ended up solving the problem was that they did not do it. It simply falls from the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time on this one.
