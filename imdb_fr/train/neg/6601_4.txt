I can understand why the purists Laurel and Hardy might take offense at this rather sweet "reenactment," but this film would be a great way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain perform reasonably the comedy duo and there is a pretty good support cast. I liked that.
