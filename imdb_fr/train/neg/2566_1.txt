Recently, part of GEORGE 2 was captured on television, but I did not manage to watch it until the end. Simply horrible! I do not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first film, which was bad enough. There was a lot of jostling, but the direction and editing was so mediocre and jerky that it was like watching taken or deleted scenes. To have the original voice of Ape the Ape in return was not enough to prepare me for this eventuality. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Damn it, because of the 10-line IMDb rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing to say about this crapulastic sequel made for television. Disney, hang your head in shame.
