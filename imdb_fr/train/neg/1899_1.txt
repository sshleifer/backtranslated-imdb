I looked at it because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and cool cars to watch. I guess they lied to me. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting in front of a Porsche dealer checking to see if he has the right car. When they confirm that it's the right one, Kip pulls a brick out of the chest and throws it at the window, breaking it. He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and leave in the night. They deliver it to a warehouse before being followed by the police. All members of the team abandon all cars and separate. Then we have a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He gives a small speech to a group of children on a kart track. Then he is confronted with Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that her brother Kip is in * deep bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a breakup and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> The film poses some problems: <br /> <br /> 1.History: the first 48 Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and plan their activities. The last 12 hours in the movie are a loss! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You see maybe 10 cars out of 50 as the movie announces. So where are the other 40 cars? Why can not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not disturbing at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats hamburgers and also swallows three keys. It's impossible. The keys have been opened. The keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach and large intestine. Guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop It will not work. The dog will have a lot of diarrhea but no key. He was reported in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a miniature car in his rectum. Take laxatives, a lot of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The cop during the hunt: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries desperately to start the car. You see a police car behind him who does not look at his car at all. But just as Nicholas Cage starts the engine, the policeman turns his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts chasing him. It's stupid. So, as soon as he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He sees only his back. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I have never seen the original, but I plan to do it. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 out of 10 stars, instead. Choose The Fast and Furious.
