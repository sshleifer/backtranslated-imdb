Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead to a hunting final in 'Return to God's Land' from the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time, she is better, even if it seems useless. "Something new" has barely a plot lying outside the hunt. There is a brief premise that sets the hero (Shipman's co-author and boyfriend) to save the girl (played by Shipman), so it's just an exhilarating and improbable hunt from there. Of course, this sounds like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell sedan, but the film as a whole is perfectly ridiculous. She does not seem to have learned much from last minute films about the rescue of D.W. Griffith or his parodies of Mack Sennett and other comedians that she imitates. <br /> <br /> The interest is that Shipman writes and directs in the film as a writer of the film, which has for protagonist a writer (Shipman again), even if it does not do much of intelligent or humorous with that, even if she tries to do it. Once again, others had been the pioneers of the writer's joke in the headlines, such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "A Girl's Folly" (1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that she does not take herself or the movie seriously - and me either. Something new, "despite what he claims, is ridiculed.
