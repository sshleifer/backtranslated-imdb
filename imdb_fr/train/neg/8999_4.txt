The alumni of Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV all come together in a sometimes funny sketch film. <br /> <br /> It is however very interesting to watch it at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after the release of this film, supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a band movie ad, which was probably not even smart at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" which was made with the mute of Arnold Schwarzenegger film "Junior" There is a parody commercial, which was probably not even smart at the time, for something starring Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling" which has now come true with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing" ago a trailer model, which was probably not even smart at the time, showing John Candy in a movie on a severed head. Watch this trailer and see how his plans and plot are similar to those of Frank Hellenlotter's Basket Case !! And finally, there is an advertisement for a documentary about "a dead dream, there are only two ..." The name of the documentary is ... THE LATEST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
