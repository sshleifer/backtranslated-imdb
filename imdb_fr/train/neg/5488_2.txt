Why the hell is Colin Firth in this useless movie? Has he really run out of money? <br /> <br /> The film does not say clearly what it is, sorrow ?, Exotic places ?, Ghosts ?, A vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a confused and muddy mess. <br /> <br /> There seems to be some sort of idea that Italy has to be good, in itself, and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but eventually girls want to return to Canada. <br /> <br /> There are unnecessary episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what is it, or why should everyone care about it is not everything quite clear. <br /> <br /> There was also a woman shooting in the movie. He did not know what the job was here, but it just seemed to be there to make tasteless, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. Was it supposed to be about pedophilia ?? <br /> <br /> A terrible disorder, all things considered. I gave him 2 rather than 1 because he does not have the charm of a totally awful movie.
