This film is a waste of time, the plot is awful, the dialogue is awful. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, but the actors have absolutely no plot or scenario to work with. Photography and some special effects are also acceptable, but again, there is nothing interesting to watch in this movie. There is no logical progression in history, history is nonsense. It's not even scary. For a film to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This film has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and makeup work are poorly executed, or at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and that you do not waste time watching this movie. are curious to see an entirely awful film.
