Columbo films have been down for years, and this year they may have bottomed out. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes like goose bumps in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard, plausibility is still lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and draws faces of pantomime and Andrew Stephens is a rather unconvincing man. (His weak, though, was a hoot!) The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronizing. They should never have brought Columbo in the nineties, they just left us one or two good memories of intelligent intrigues, better scripts and sharp characterizations.
