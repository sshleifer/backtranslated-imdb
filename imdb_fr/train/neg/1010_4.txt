I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman participate. It seemed so promising. And that was the case until the arrival of Justin Timberlake. He is a very bad actor and should never be allowed to make a film. I mean, he's one of the most boring and uninspired actors I know. He puts absolutely no emotion in any of his lines. Why was he chosen for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull he seems to be a bad mix of his characters in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound cool, but believe me, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's game is very good. This is one of the very good things in this movie. He is just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. It does, however, have some really interesting passages. <br /> <br /> About the story, although it was a bit obvious and sometimes exaggerated, it was good. I was expecting a big change when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
