I guess you have to give some arguments for the courage to write a musical about a history lesson, but what about decent music? <br /> <br /> Is Howard DeSilva's caricature role-playing game designed to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children? <br /> <br /> Was William Daniels' contemporary campy actor style (for the time) intended to please a 60/70 demographic? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the jokes on NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience mocking.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find the whole thing obsolete, boring and way too annoying for the screen.
