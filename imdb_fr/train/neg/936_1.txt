I do not understand people. Why is this movie doing a 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I had high hopes for this film, but once half an hour passed, I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of reviews on this site, people say it's one of the best action movies they've seen (or summer, year, etc.). They say it's a great conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What has been concluded (aside from the fact that Bourne can drive motorcycles, shoot and fight better than anyone else)? What did you learn about the Bourne character in this movie ????????? Absolutely f ****** Nothing !!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the movie? I do not like cinematography and film editing. The shaky camera effect and the fast changing shots were used TOO MUCH and they age quickly (it did not bother me in Supremacy because it was always easy to follow and was not used to excess) and gave me the fear of heights. I wanted to quickly save my $$$ for something else. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot. All this movie is a 115 minute chase. Bourne, whom you learn absolutely nothing in the 115 minutes of the film, is a perfectionist in all his attempts. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you do not know anyone and a wide range of new characters is featured in this episode. Some people said that this movie had incredible writing and suspense. ?????????? !!!!!!!! What writing ???? What suspense ??? There is no suspense. Bourne is so perfect to do everything he does, I do not think he has anything to worry about. If it's the best movie of the year 2007, I may stop watching movies entirely !!!! <br /> <br /> Many people have also claimed that Matt Damon's performance in this film was one of the best (if not the best) of his career. What performance? How many lines did he have in this movie ??? I have a certain respect for Damon because he played in movies that I liked and played different types of characters, but a good actor is someone that you can hardly recognize from one movie to another , someone who chooses different types of roles. Not someone who plays the same roles again and again (which Damon does not do, but the example of someone who does it is Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie was a big disappointment for me. I do not recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I highly recommend reading the three books (which are very different from the movies).
