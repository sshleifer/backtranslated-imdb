Following the usual formula for recruiting a new recruit - this time the first African-American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman desegregated the armed forces - via the US Navy's high seamen training program, led by a racist zealot (Robert De Niro). If the program is not enough, it must be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and screams effectively in gibberish. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father in the Southwest as a poor black farm boy, is the expected paragon of rectitude. The girls - we could hardly call them women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are especially there to say that their men have to make good sense. Other honest performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more superficial roles. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes inside, uncovered. After a brutal assault on the hospital staff, he was transferred instead of being dismantled. Someone shouts "I came out of here" in the early 1950s. (Maybe that was a common phrase at the time, if so, "my bad.") People get speak by rank - "Lieutenant", "Mate of yachtsman", "Commander", as they do in the army, of the navy, they are simple "Sir" (if it is an officer) or are called by their last name (if they are enlisted). I did not bother to check if there was a rank called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding struggles to fight. It seems everyone in the Navy hates the Negroes, with the exception of a guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and is despised by others in his class. It is like the scene in "Animal House", in which the plaintiff of a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a man enlisted man, a second class master. He succeeds in marrying a beautiful woman who has just finished her medical studies. In one of their arguments, she argues with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, leave the navy and lead a quiet life. "And let life escape you?", He retorted. Yes. Yes, just be the wife of a doctor and let life escape you. You can signal him from the Boca Raton Golf Course. <br /> <br /> These kinds of movies were pretty common during the Second World War. "Bomber", "Airial Gunner", that kind of thing. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You learned how to become a bomber or gunner. Here, the technical details are skipped, perhaps because the author knew nothing about them (except Boyle's Law, which we learned in chemistry at high school). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what was happening during emergencies without which such a film would not exist. If I solved the mechanical problems, it's because I guessed correctly. The management is of no help either. The film is full of close-ups, so numerous that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had. And emergencies are confusing because they are poorly centered. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Want to see a better example of this type of movie? Almost anyone will do - except perhaps "G.I. Jane", in which the abused hero is a heroine. Try the training camp scenes in "Young Lions". The victim is a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity", in which no button of easy sympathy is pushed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and who is active in triggering the conflict, just like "Cool Hand Luke". No easy excuses are offered because the excuse is too easy. <br /> <br /> Entirely formal, and not well done.
