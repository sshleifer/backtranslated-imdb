this film has everything; the clever camera work, reminiscent of Martin Scorcese, or Oliver Stone, the squeezing of the heat, the explosive action of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, the witty dialogue of a Tarantino script and the epic sense of the word "The Godfather" <The character reappears with a fiery temperament, but also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the portrait of jake la motta by robert de niro in bull bull raging. The action scenes are truly breathtaking. Since a movie is portrayed with so many stylish car scenes. Special effects push the limits of technology and cinema. Independence Day sets the standard that this film has clearly matched and largely surpassed. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's great to play a list (like a list of invitations to an evening from the Oscars!), Chic places, striking action, and a tight script.
