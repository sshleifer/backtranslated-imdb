A guy is beaten. Just in plain sight, this other guy shoots him. He has bodyguards and they hit the killer, but a reporter is interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who hurt himself. She enters and warns a bodyguard, but he does not want to talk. I can not understand why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She is the only journalist there. Be that as it may, her publisher discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey, she does it anyway. She's going to see the killer's sister and mother. A few minutes after his departure, they are banged on, someone explodes their caravan, a huge fireball. She then looks for the bodyguard at the hospital. She finds him on the boat with the hangover, but a minute later, they are both sucking a scuba tank because three guys are trying to hit them (and blew up the boat - a huge ball of fire). The reporter and the bodyguard hit two of the guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, another guy gets hit crossing the street, there is a shooting with several raids in a warehouse, car chases with wrecks and death, a fake suicide etc. etc. Lotsa stiffness, all types of carnage. <br /> <br /> Excellent thing, but what the reporter and the bodyguard can not understand is this: why, in hell, the original guy got himself. What is the motivation? Of course, this could help us understand why the journalist is even interested. Through most of this, she is the only journalist in history. Nobody in the media cares. Not even with all the big balls of fire and corpses. Certainly, the original guy who was beaten was not really a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> Is it the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there is no television camera, no other reporter, no blogger ... just another of those crimes committed by the police ... <br /> <br /> So, what is the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Let me think ... <br /> <br /> No! Expect! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yeah ... the first lady. She was hurt because the president was laughing. And she gets away with it. She's really strong, huh? But how on earth could anyone understand that? Why would anyone bother? After all, only one journalist is even interested. <br /> <br /> I give this movement a "1". It was so stupid that I had to keep watching. And it has become more stupid! It's the real spoiler! But even if I told you, you have to see it to believe it!
