Gillian Anderson is an arrogant and motivated career woman who uses Danny Dyer, a working class worker, for an entertaining evening. After a stupid accident in the country, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought that "Straightheads" was terrible.

It's certainly the kind of movie that would have had a budget-free exit directly on video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I do not know how "Straightheads" got a movie outing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I do not care about sex and violence in movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) good plot or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" had neither one nor the other. No progression in the plot or characters and too much remains unexplained and unspoken. Fortunately, "Straightheads" went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because there was a germ of an interesting film, with a particularly interesting twist of intrigue in the last third. How many times do I say that, but it could have been good if it had been done correctly. Too bad. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they do not hide anything with this film.
