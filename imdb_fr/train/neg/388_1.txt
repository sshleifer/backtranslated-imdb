I do not support most reality shows and this is worse than Paris Hilton, and of course, it's his company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired", how many seasons now? After watching the show, I would not want to work for the guy with his ego and everyone else and I think that watching the paint dry has more than an entertainment valve. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear one person get up and say, "Donald, I quit smoking, I take some of your money and I buy a good hairstyle". I see he's even trying to buy some glory in the WWE fight. I hope he will be hurt and that I will not have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want celebrity so badly and not to have talent and to make the ass of yourself trying to buy it. If I could, I would give this show a negative rating, but it would get a 1 and it did not deserve that.
