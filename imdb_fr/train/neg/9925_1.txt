It was on the DVD of the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, himself brilliant, but not this one. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name here and I can guess why, it makes a lot more sense not to be associated with this pilot. My god, who would find that funny. Of course, there may be a race problem, but for me it just was not funny, because it's just not funny. It's as if writers do not even try to be funny, just to take advantage of their equality with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to last several seasons when they realized this pilot? Deep down, they did not care. She was a quick-milk cow who, thank God, did not cash. I guess it's only useful for historical purposes, or just to show how Hollywood writers can be stupid and unimaginative.
