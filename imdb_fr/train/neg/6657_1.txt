I really hate this delayed show, it sucks! big time, and personally I think it's insulting to the fairy kind (if you believe in fairies that is); I mean that people who invented such shit should have their head to look at eh? and there's a LOT of madness (the diabolical teacher, which I think becomes really old) and also the stupidity (the boy's parents and the godfather of the fairy) in this show - two of the things I challenged and that I hate the whole world (especially stupidity). <br /> <br /> Overall, I say that this show is so boring and should not be seen by all prying eyes (it would make them bleed to death)!
