When I was younger, I really liked watching bad television. We were all guilty of it at one time or another, but my excuse for watching films like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is: I was young and naive; ignoring what makes a show really useful. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I appreciate the good things now. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12-year-old would love every unusual piece, every line of dialogue frozen, every piece of useless technobabble. Writing is insipid beyond that; so tasteless and bland that it makes Star Trek miss: Voyager. If your show makes me dream of the worst Trek show of all time, you have problems. <br /> <br /> The Stargate movie is a wonderful guilty pleasure. It is anchored in two strong performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell. fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score and fresh science fiction ideas. With the exception of a bit of original music, nothing that made the movie fun appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver interesting to watch and Legend, seems to be half asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low, because the decorations sometimes look like someone's basement. Cinematography is not much better, as vanilla and as dull as the scenarios. It surprises me that shows with a lot more style (like Farscape) and stuff (like Battlestar Galactica reinvented) have smaller fans and less rabid than this pap. It just does not deserve it.
