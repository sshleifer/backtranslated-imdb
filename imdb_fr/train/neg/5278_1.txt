When a comedy film claims its soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not dealing with a movie of the highest order. I rented this movie with friends who were hoping for a few laughs but, overall, we laughed at laughing and laughing at the movie. We could not have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The film may have gone well with a few changes. First of all, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were badly done and badly placed. The big kid in the movie made us want to commit suicide, bless him for trying stage after scene, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If it had been removed from the film, everything could have been bearable. There were some funny jokes. I think one of them was when the group of boys stole one of the parent porn movies. It's actually gay porn. But to sum up the comedy at best, I'm just going to tell the opening gag for the big kid. He is wearing a spotted shirt and is talking about not knowing when something is done. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editor of the film could have saved the film by removing the big boy and removing 20 minutes of school scenes and end more than thirty seconds of random quarrels. <br /> <br /> Oh, BTW, the film has two good elements. Kadeem Hardison plays his role perfectly and interprets his jokes so that nothing is forgotten or underestimated. The other redeeming element of the film is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. His character is ignored during most of the film, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, even by renting this one. I did not like it and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
