I was surprised when I saw this movie. I had heard that it was the best movie of the novel. What a disappointment I was. <br /> <br /> The way a real fan of Jane Austen can evaluate this adaptation is a mystery to me. The writers have decided to stick to ridiculous pieces of humor that are embarrassing in the best case, but which also spoil the atmosphere of the period. As for casting: Gwyneth Paltrow is a rather superficial heroine (but any "hot" American star would be dubious in the role), Toni Collette is a bad idea and poor Ewan McGregor is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really can not say a good thing about this movie. It seems like I'm one of the few not to rate it, but if you want my opinion, look instead at the television production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, this is far better than this superficial hogwash.
