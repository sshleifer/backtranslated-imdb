Absolute waste. The reason why it's so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The supposed star did nothing to solve the case - and no one else did it - it was simply routine police work. Absolutely tedious. <br /> <br /> You sat to the end, hoping for a rebound, and you had only a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential to have a parent kidnapped. Could the lieutenant's personal involvement finally cloud his judgment? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were those of a stranger. But surely a genius like Lieutenant C, in constant conversation with the injured husband, would gradually discover an evil conspiracy involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom would surprise the bride, hide the body and then give clues subtle. It could have been good. It was a total loss of time.
