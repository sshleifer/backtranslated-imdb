This movie was so ridiculous that I never even finished looking at it. I actually thought someone had created their own version and copied it to the DVD of the movie store. This movie made me sick not because it was gore, but because I lost $ 50 on it! It looks like my brother and I went to a house and did the film ourselves and put up slaughterhouse pictures! I'm so excited, even the BTK Killer deserves more credit than it was not even accurate, I mean that coming on the cow's head was obviously made of play dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I can not even get all the words to explain it NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!
