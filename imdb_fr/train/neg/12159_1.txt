I can not believe I looked at that, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie would become unintentionally funny and funny towards the end. and it did it. the highlight was the mediocre performance ever made by defense counsel - so much outside of reality that even for a fictional story, he was far too weird. it is impossible for anyone on this planet to behave in court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on the planet. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. a simple search of his house would have resulted in the discovery of the rings. but not leave. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was all. The crazy blonde received a truth drug to prove her innocence, but not Brett. the lunatic had almost an altar of Brett at home that could have proved her obsession sick. but again not go. During the court scene, I felt the silent urge to tip her hand and hit her several times against her head. even the real crazies do not look as stupid as fake "I'm innocent" as she did. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls on the stairs, her husband will be thrown in prison, guilty or not. wicked, wicked men.
