A disappointing end to the season that started so well ... <br /> <br /> The second part of Exodus and other notable episodes are among the best on TV of all series, where the situation was rather bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure this episode was a disappointment, but the cheese guitar music that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more comfortable in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if business leaders did not like the serious end of note and wanted to ignite it. They failed and ruined everything. <br /> <br /> Hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> We have at least seen the return of a certain person even though he was a little weird and really done.
