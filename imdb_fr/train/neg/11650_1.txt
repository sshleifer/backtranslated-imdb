After the first, you think the wayans brothers could tell us new jokes. Although I guess not. If the first was not serious enough, it is so bad that it hurts to watch. With all the actors they have in this movie, you think they could come up with something a little smarter. Even if they could not, they had to take all the same silly jokes, not funny, from the beginning to the end, and insert it into the film thinking that people would laugh again. Although the thing is that I did not laugh the first time. They tried to make these movies parodies even if they failed at all levels. Most of the time, it's just jokes randomly inserted, so disgusting and so exciting that it's hard to watch and enjoy. Then, when they try to make scenes that are parodies of movies, they end up creating a 20-minute scene reproduction with perhaps a joke in the entire scene. Also for those who say it's not for the young and older audience, I'm getting into the age range for which he's supposed to be funny. While people say that different people have different ideas about what's funny or not, if you find that funny, then you're probably not one of the most mature or smart people of the moment. Writing this kind of script does not require a lot of talent, but if you want a smarter and funnier movie, check out the movie Spaceballs. It's a parody of a film that is actually well and well done and it did not need to use disgusting and hot jokes to make it funny either.
