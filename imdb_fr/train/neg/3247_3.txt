I was looking forward to seeing this movie because it seemed really promising for the next attractions: Jim Carrey, with divine powers, was an idea that really worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure he would be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? Yesterday my bubble burst a lot, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where he hates his life is an unhappy employee and a very unhappy camper with an ax against God) is useful, the second act (where he is summoned by God by telephone and gets Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey is having fun with her new "toys" and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny. But the third act is miserable beyond belief. <br /> <br /> The rot begins to be felt after dinner between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), who EXCEPTIONALLY succeeds in this film, her role being she thinks her question will be asked but instead, he tells her (on one knee bent, again) that he ends up landing his news presenter position, and is not that so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. She wants him to marry her, you see, so she ends up leaving him, you see, even though she still loves him a lot, you see, and the rest of the movie is about to hit our heads with only one pathetic , too heavy - handed a spiritual cliche after another, until the end, I prayed too. . for it to be finished. <br /> <br /> The lack of subtlety in the first two acts did not bother me (for example, in the second act, after he got his powers, Bruce sliced ​​into the hall singing: "And if God was one of us, just a slob like one of us, "blah blah blah), and I was even ready to forget the incredible amount of contradictions that were thrown at us (for the openers, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce that he can not violate anyone's free will, but he does so often). These choices were forgivable - this is a comedy by Jim Carrey, directed by Tom Shadyac - it's not about the remains of the day. <br /> <br /> Or rather it was supposed to be a comedy. When writers lose track of this (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the debates into a kind of Film Message (gag), we get a hell on earth instead. Bruce realizes the mistake of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his savings - it must be said - thanks, and that his priorities in life had been badly misinterpreted. All this could have been transmitted much less, however. The film did not have to go into the dumper to argue these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to solve the story intelligently, so they took the path of panic in the hope that we would not notice it. They even added surprisingly inconclusive catch in the end, in the hope that it would lessen bad taste. It did not work for me.
