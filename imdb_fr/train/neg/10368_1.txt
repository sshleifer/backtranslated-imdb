This "film" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to even try to be realistic. The plot is weak, acting - miserable, actors wondering as in a production of 1st year, trying very hard to act without any chance from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for all concerned, including the public. Well, as in any thriller, there are also murders, corpses and blood. Imagine a person who, 5 minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling, not to say pure as a whistle, as if the throat was cut by a virtual agent. Moreover, this murder was supposed to be committed by a fragile little woman on a strong and strong man, and she slit her throat !!! Did she politely ask him to look for her? Much more stupidity of the same kind happens and lets the audience wonder if it meant being a joke that turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another major problem, for example: the hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his young virgin wife to leave the bathroom and fall asleep after a long time (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking for advice for the landscapes! NOT A WORD ON THE LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time, even trying to write about this "movie" supposed to be low-down.
