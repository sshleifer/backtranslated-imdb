My favorite memory of this show and the group was when I ended up with a group of hating NBB friends and had a big bonfire. members of the group and threw them into the fire and danced a joyful jig around the burning stuff singing "Ding Dong, the witch is dead". It was the best thing about the series and this series is stupid with a capitol god, this series is nil. I hate so much. Get rid of the crappy car. You are really worthless! You really ruined the whole chain! Without wanting to offend anyone or anything but you need a life, I mean, really, who makes a stupid show with a silly singer who can not even sing! You speak really horrible and you must have a life of hobos or whatever, except Roselina. She is really pretty But still, you are crazy!
