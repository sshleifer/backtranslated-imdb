The Jewish journalist Justin Timberlake (Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is perplexed when an accused in a courtroom whispers "Thank you" to Agent LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) who testifies as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, the explanation is given. You will see Mr. Cool J. Dylan McDermott's evil detective partner (Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The police in the town of Edison are so corrupt that they shoot down their suspects, steal their money and sniff their drug. Whether it is to impress his girlfriend (here called "Pussy") or to win a Pulitzer, the corruption of the city does not encumber the noble Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches both an unexpected range and a life threatening danger. Screenwriter / director David J. Burke keeps the film out of the water, but barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the contest "From the pop star to the movie star" (also called the "rapper to actor" progression). Mr. McDermott is having fun with his role. Actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace) seriously support the debates. F.R.A.T. First Response Assault and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" is performed by Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (17/09/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
