Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I have seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare film before the first season (episdoe K-20) is undoubtedly one of the worst films ever made. Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, three "stars", fight the worst film prize in history by offering footage written by a secret Dick Dickey working group of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to reduce the funding available in bulk. research on public transit and energy efficiency. It looks like the film was shot in almost total darkness, maybe on Super 8. It makes Logan's Run look like Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine looking at it without the comments of Crow and Servo because it is unassailable, even with that. It is clear that in Hollywood, you need a kind of 401K that prevents actors from shooting bad movies like this one to pay for their health care. With his theme "Rights to pollute and drive", in the end, I almost expect to see a cameo from Charlton Heston where he delivers his speech "cold hands". Lee, I could have forgiven you that in 1989, but in 1981?
