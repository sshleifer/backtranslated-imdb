Although I recently positively criticized OPERATION PETTICOAT, I did not really like this movie, even though it had many similarities. Cary Grant and the two comedies of the Second World War were both made. However, the tone and style of the movies were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, on the whole, seemed to be a cheaper film - with poor writing, little energy and VERY wide performances - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least some of the responsibility for this situation lies in Jayne Mansfield's choice. The combination of his many talents and his limited acting abilities really made this tight-budget film seem to come from a third-class studio. In addition, there was not much chemistry or energy in his affair with Cary Grant - an actor generally loved for his grace and class. It's a bit like associating Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
