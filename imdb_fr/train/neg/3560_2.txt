For me, this story begins with funny jokes about Frank's fanatics when he travels with a staircase and sits in a work meeting ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies / funny situations over and over and over again. It's too predictable. It's more like a TV story where you can leave and come back without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough, even if it's a comedy, you have to have more variations and a kind of message to his audience ... . <br /> <br />
