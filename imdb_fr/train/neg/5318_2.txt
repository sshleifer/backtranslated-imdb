Well, I had to be generous and give her a 2. That was mainly due to the free holes made in that woman's shirt where her breasts were. I found this slightly amusing. Apart from that, this movie only provides some good laughs with a friend. It's funny if you're ready to throw "mystery science theater" comments with someone, but it's no better than a 2. And a 2 is really bad.
