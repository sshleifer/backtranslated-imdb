The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the film is pretty good, even the realization. The main problem castings, who turned this film into another room and regular shot, with a lack of impact and a lack of even bigger impression. Except for the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all the other players were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the eldest blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without intensity as the lead role. therefore, the character she acted had become gentle and discreet. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal than a real movie. But after all, it's a good starting point and important improvements for the future.
