This film is another in the long line: no budget, no effort, no talent film shot on video and offers a nice cover to the dupe of unsuspecting tenants at the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what's watching this movie, it's like: grab a video camera and red food coloring and film yourself and your friends roaming the neighborhood at night growling and "attacking" " people. Congratulations, you just did "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now, see if a distribution company will buy you. <br /> <br /> I saw low-budget video films shot that showed the talent of filmmakers and actors or at least an effort, but that did. Avoid unless you are a real masochist or you are amused by poorly made horror movies.
