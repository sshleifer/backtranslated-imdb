The Lives of the Saints begins with an atmospheric view of London as a vibrant city of vibrant, picturesque, sunny streets. I hoped it would maintain that atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that almost goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for big and fat Mr. Karva, his stepfather less I think that's what he's supposed to be because he's never really defined, but he drop the kittens in deep fryers, so believe me, it's a sting) that makes small rips while his creepy girlfriend gives daddy crafts. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always rushes from A to B. Until the day he comes across an almost silent homeless child who gives him his wish to stop running. Runner throws the lost boy into Othello's apartment, where he quickly begins to grant his wishes. Anxious to fulfill some of her desires, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he is not sure what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another manual job? Anyway, I do not want the boy to give him the second. <br /> <br /> It takes a long time to get there and there are a lot of repetitive scenes. The end is trying to be shocking, but since there is hardly any backtracking on the investment in any of these characters, it only serves as a release to the bored audience. <br /> <br /> The writer Tony Grisoni, one of Terry Gilliam's favorites, tries to blend into a kind of religious allegory that ends up being pretentious as hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least better explanations for the characters who acted suddenly in a strange way, the film would have been more enjoyable. In the current state of things, we are confronted with a group of enormous huge mouths that seem to miraculously develop intelligence against the mysterious boy. Who is the origin never revealed. It's just irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from moments of sporadic atmosphere and a bad mood score, this film has little to recommend.
