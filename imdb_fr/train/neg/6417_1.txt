How comments like the one that made one of the high school girls were even on this site, it was the most stupid movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can a moron sit there and to say that it's a good movie, it's perhaps the most stupid thing I've ever heard, I could sneak behind you and go "Boo" and that would make you jump, but that does not mean not that I am qualified to write or direct a film, not to say "they have everything tied to the end" is not a good reason for a film to be well received. What kind of film would it be if they did not tie everything together, I guess that would make it a half-movie, not an entire movie. So, basically, this idiot compliments them for finishing the movie. I love how today's young people are holding media and production companies at such a high level. It is not surprising that the political system of this country can get away with what he wants, we have fools like that in our country, what would happen if this girl ended up managing something one day it's a scary thought. Take a life and watch a real movie from time to time, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something like that, and do not say it was "boring" after seeing it, just use the little brain that God has given you to analyze it a little bit.
