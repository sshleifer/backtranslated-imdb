Okay, I rented this movie because of the director ... he made some interesting movies in the past (if you have not seen Waxork, you miss a fun tour). Anyway, I had doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck it and watch it. It's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not mind, the chandeliers read in advance. First of all, the old adage "You can not judge a book by its cover" applies here. The box for this film seems to indicate that Jill is the fox with long hair and locks. The back of the box contains a photo of Jill in red leather and some other photos. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. You start to watch the movie and you discover that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total bitch who is not the girl on the cover. The film is not as predictable as one might think ... and it's not a good thing. The characters do so much nonsense without any motivation, it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie, Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph kill this other cold-blooded woman who was helping her? Anthony Hickox, the director should have seen a whore when he was reading the script. Had he been placed in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters half intelligent, he might have been decent. To situate it in the 1970s is meaningless and has no impact on history. Avoid it!
