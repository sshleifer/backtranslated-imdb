the worst film I have ever seen in a theater. I saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and I figured it was accepted as a festival. It was an interesting concept, that seemed to be able to go somewhere, but was falling apart every time he tried to do anything. First, if you are going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of a cheesy piano game that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they were not obvious nursery rhymes, they were groaning rhymes that showed how far they stretched to try to make this movie work. and you would think of finding people who could sing to make a musical, right? not in this case. fortunately, they were half talking / singing rhyming most of the time, but when they sang, it made me shudder. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and this only concerns music. some actors were good enough, but a lot of dialogue was terrible, as were most of the scenes. obviously, they did not have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad publisher, because they were constantly skipping the line and using terrible choices while cutting the movie. at least the director was willing to admit that nobody wanted the script until they added the catchphrase to make it a musical. I hope investors will make sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake.
