Power Rangers, the ugly 90s children's series continues to upset young children with its full-flavored cheese taste and appalling parameters. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach child abuse how to fight each other in order to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were a further demonstration of the promotion of a violent TV show, etc. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to do this to understand the purpose of this completely ridiculous show. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst children's shows of all time.
