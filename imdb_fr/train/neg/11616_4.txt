I did not like the movie, Joshua. Maybe it's because I saw another much better movie, called Orphan 2 days ago, but maybe it's just because it was not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not really original, but that does not mean that the film will not succeed. It could have been suspenseful, entertaining, and soothing, but instead, construction was slow, boring, uneventful, and it really did not let me think more than "it was not so good" when everything was finished. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motives are revealed. I will not give that, but the reality is that he did not really achieve his goals, because despite Vera Farmiga, his mother, Abby, disappearing three-quarters of the movie, all the arrows indicate that she will return soon to the House. She was taken to a psychiatric facility because she lost her mind, but Joshua's father / her husband was accused of tampering with her medication, which indicates to the public that the institution had understood that she was not she did not have a mental illness, but was receiving a medical dose. So ... should not she be home soon? Did not Joshua fail? Will not his mother live soon with him and his sister and maybe even his father? I question the Father because his future remains open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. The demonic child Joshua was not really scary. The story moved slowly and when he picked up, he was still boring. The suspense fell flat every time. When it was over, I could not believe I had witnessed all that. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the role of the parents was good, especially Vera Farmiga as a mother, but if you want to see a movie about a diabolical "child", go see Orphan. This is a film that took a non-original concept and created a brilliant film.
