I was forced to watch this whole series of movies when I was little and was told they were TRUE! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only useful for people who believe in this ridiculous and who want to indoctrinate their children by making them believe the same thing. In addition to the obvious problems of brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also bad acting, bad writing, and "special effects" BAD. These are terrible and terrible movies. Yes, credible (and horrible) for a child, but I can not imagine an adult joining this market. Although, I must say, I would be interested to see them today, as adults. They might have some midnight movie / cult feel to them.
