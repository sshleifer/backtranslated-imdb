The film is about two stories: one is a political murder of a call girl, the other is a political party of the upper class. The crossing point is the character of public relation played by Al Paccino, because he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the scenario is terrible without any decent dialogue and emptiness of direction whatever the meaning of the drama, Al's performance is memorable: how many comrades can be as convincing as a powerful man and dreaded (as "The Godfather") that here a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become a tired old man. This passage of ages is very moving, because it pushes the public to grow old too. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up, because he can regain his energy on the Church stage. <BR /> <br /> Maybe it's a good thing the movie is so awful because it highlights Al's talent!
