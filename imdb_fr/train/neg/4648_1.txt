It's a bad B movie posing as a fake documentary. The porn documentary film has almost as much screen time and dialogue as any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary sensation" that they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not a fake documentary is the least of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The film has nothing interesting to say about the porn trade. It's not even particularly salacious. Even if the sex is simulated, the amount of nudity is mild for a movie rated R. <br /> <br /> One day, someone will prepare a good documentary about the porn industry. It's not that.
