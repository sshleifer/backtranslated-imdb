Somehow, I would have read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing it, I would call it anything but. the point of this film escapes me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many sets seemed to be thoughts after the fact, and despite all the nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic in this film ... everything lets me ask myself what he returns from it. ! the premise of the title could have been the basis of a funny comedy (so politically incorrect). instead, we are treated for inexpensive, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and strangeness for herself. if I want that, I'll buy a cd from Grace Jones.
