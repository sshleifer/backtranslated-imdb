I imagine that the young people who participated in making "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" and several other titles) must have felt a bit strange on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people into believing that aliens were invading ("The War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the greatest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now, Orson Welles has starred in a third-class movie about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is basically nothing creative about this film. A lot of nudity, but the ambient music is always very entertaining. Although the film was not particularly predictable, it was still not worth watching. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, he has told the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and animated the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (on Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
