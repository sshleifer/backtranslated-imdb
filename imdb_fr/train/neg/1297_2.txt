Basically, I chose this film because I had seen the brilliant remake of Zatoichi by Kitano Takashi and that I was in the mood to tell a new story of samurai update starring Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and diverted the traditional clich√©s of the samurai film. Gojoe goes deep in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies in which other characters inform the audience of the nature of the main character instead of developing it during the film. . "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," said almost all the characters in the presence of Benkei, but this inner turmoil is barely transmitted to the character itself. Instead of character development, we get battle scenes that are swollen, boring and bloody. The character of Asano is underdeveloped and even he seems to be bored and not knowing what he is doing there. I know he usually looks cool and cool and that's part of Asano's appeal, but this movie does not serve him. <br /> <br /> Much of the movement of the camera is nauseating. There is a scene that lasts forever in which the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I want to vomit. The end is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Too bad that very good movies about samurai are not made in Japan with this type of budget. The colors, sets and costumes were great, but the rest is a minimal waste of time. I would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
