Now, I have seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Action movies particularly bad. I have seen (and appreciated) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including the one where he is his own clone, the two where he plays the twins and the three where he is a cyborg. In fact, I own one where he plays a fashion designer and fights in a truck filled with durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he has a nice ass and you almost always have the chance to see him.With the DVD, you can even take a break and zoom in!) That's why you can trust when I say that this film is so bad that it makes Citizen Kane look like 9. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. The waterfalls are bad. FX is bad. The acting is spectacular, terribly sinister, and most likely shows the worst performance of every alleged cast member, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that says a lot. And I would bet that all the people involved in this movie are ugly to bed, to begin with. Mostly Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> He manages to be involuntarily funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or very stoned. I could sit down myself because I needed to watch something to distract myself from rinsing cat urine from my laundry. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a gay artist.
