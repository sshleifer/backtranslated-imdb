In fact, this film, made in 1999, has very good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There are not many clowns running, spending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting the flesh. There are also no frantic car chases or accidents where machines worth thousands of dollars are unnecessarily put in the trash. <br /> <br /> The interior has a respectably modern air, the architecture, and the equipment is up to par. Well, there is this high-tech computer room with what looks like the remains of a 1950s electronics lab. And the pancake makeup on the corpses made me crack. No make-up for pancakes in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter covered with their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that bodies have become calcified - although the way the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left to the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the worst premise for a sci-fi horror movie, but I can not. A computer virus transmitted via a television screen (or computer screen) that becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Leave me alone. Driving to the "Star Trek" is one thing, but do photons become viruses? It's so ridiculous that the desired "fear factor" is simply not achievable. The film could have used one of those terrible dream sequences where the dead come alive, or let a cat out of the closet, or something like that, because the viralamajig virus does not do that. <br /> <br /> It can be presumed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this inanity that Lord Oliver has given to some of his later and trashy halls. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two, however, should be interpreted.
