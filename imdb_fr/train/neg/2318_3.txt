A child found as a baby in the trash and raised in a martial arts academy has the knack for pouring baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents. Infinitely better in pieces, action comedy is a real mess as a whole. He seems to be trying to adopt a version of Shaolin Soccer's trendy basketball, but the comedy is scattered. His focus is more on a Chihuahua with ADD for a quadruple espresso. I kept asking, "What am I looking at?" I watched it from start to finish and I still do not know what happened. It's a shame because there are excellent action scenes, funny jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, nothing is alike, I would take a pass.
