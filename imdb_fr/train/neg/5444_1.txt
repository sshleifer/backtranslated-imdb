It was 1974 with Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> That alone tells what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had reformed, had a good wife and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may have been a naive innocent, or maybe he just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Whether or not Slovik is part of the story, but it's a movie about desertion at a time when a country was wondering why it was fighting, and the film was taken <br /> <br /> Regardless of the soldiers who were in Viet Nam no longer in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's face it, it was the war in Viet Nam and not the Second World War. world), the propaganda EoES as Gung Ho had been in the 40s. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik expressed his position bluntly. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous state, and believe me, if I had done the military service, it would not have been a problem to let my nerves fail and to accomplish my tasks and to obtain a demotion or to put myself at the service of the PK or latrine obligation without problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe in teleflick, Slovik did not have that possibility, probably because of his criminal background. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is to the viewer. I have learned that the films of this decade or decade, whether it be service or military service, will take more or less the same position over and over again. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s, serve your country. <BR /> <br /> Years 1960 and 1970, make fun of your country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed predictable to me in Hollywood. He refused to serve and it was only when he was tied up to be executed that he showed emotion. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional explosion could easily have worked to his advantage in the statement of his nervous state, but obviously The film wanted to show it as a human being and only when he is about to die that he becomes grief. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the hail recital Mary of Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny because they looked like they were trying to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film could be viewed without realizing that it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it was worth it for Slovik and everyone who chose to follow his example.
