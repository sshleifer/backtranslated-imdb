I'm a big fan of westerns but this one ... whew, what a stink! I think that what almost immediately distracted me was the insane dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Faced with this appalling dialogue, none of them seemed ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of these things are a bit better than those of an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably THE "big" star of this film, which, if you called it B-Western, made you compliments. Maybe that's what we should call a westerner minus B. Pity Sterling Hayden, who has appeared at other times with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. For him to appear in such a poor vehicle, he must have tried to minimize it for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> A boring aspect of this film is that all men look like they have not shaved. a week and their faces are all fat. I know in the old west, guys were not always well done, but for a man, it's a movie that makes you want to go see 'EWWWW!' Really, it's a shabby Western. Denver Pyle also had to beat this one, especially after appearing in so many westerns. Bad, bad movie.
