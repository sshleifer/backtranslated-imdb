At the time of writing this review in 2008, we are bogged down in a remake culture. The movie studios seem determined to ruin the greatest number of classic movies with totally useless updates, such as "King Kong", "The Wicker Man" and virtually every film that has ever played Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as "Dough for the Do-Do" proves. A totally useless color version of Porky in Wackyland's surrealist masterpiece, Bob Clampett's "Dough for the Do-Do" sucks the life of the original by splashing all of Clampett's original footage into color and adding new ones. lame films supervised by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a director totally inappropriate for manipulating Clampett's source material, although in reality no director could hope to get close to Clampett's inspired madness. Inevitably, then, "Dough for the Do-Do" is nothing more than the rape of a classic to which is attached a new appalling title. For fans of cartoons like me, this is equivalent to a colorization of 'Casablanca'.
