University students, emptying a condemned dormitory, are hunted down by an elusive assassin. <br /> <br /> The bloody dormitory (or jokes) is a bit of a mixed backpack for slasher fans. The value of film production is rather low and the story is mostly quite routine, there is even a scary tramp lying around for a red herring. In fact, much of the story is quite memorable, with the exception of one or two brutal murders. But the film is really improved by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and by a rather bold and unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The distribution is mostly dull. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot since it is a very nice turn. Look for a young Daphne Zuniga as a bad student. <br /> <br /> In summary, you will see a fairly conventional effort on the part of B, but the final is well worth it. For this viewer, the movie was saved. complete ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** on ****
