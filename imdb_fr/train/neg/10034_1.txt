If there is one film that is the worst of this year, it's TASHAN. The first promotion indicated that the movie would be a boring Dhoom 2 movie. Well, I knew it would be a bad movie no matter what it might be. It's a Yashraj movie Or maybe see the cheesy promo But this movie shocked me, it was even worse then Dhoom 2 and what I expected from the introduction of First Saif which is boring. Then Saif-Kareena meets. oh my god, what is he doing in such a strange film? What kind of role is it? What game does it play? His first scene is fine, but then his act becomes repetitive and he exaggerates. Next is Akshay, who has provided some pretty scenes, but the film is becoming more and more boring and contains everything that is out of date. The end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have had 3 more movies to realize, if this movie had worked, it's yashraj's strategy, only money, so So Vijay is another addition to their list of music makers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is ordinary <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar appears in the film as a breath of fresh air, it actually provides interesting moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is just as bad Anil Kapoor Hams outrageously and spoils the show even more The rest is fine
