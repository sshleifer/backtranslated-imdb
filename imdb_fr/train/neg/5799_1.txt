I rented this film yesterday largely because of the beauty of the art and the abstract presented on the back of the jacket. After inserting it into my DVD player, I re-examined the jacket, and even though I removed it from the plastic viewer, I could ALWAYS not read the detailed information about film production. This film is called Evil on the Jacket and was supposed to locate it by consulting the Faith Films website to discover the links, here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The filming and special effects made in the film were quite satisfying. ... THEN, an actor reading lines spoke. Oh, my God ... the actor's reading was like a high-school boy whose hair had been able to change pitch without trying to go beyond reading the lines of the screenplay. . At first, I thought I had a bad record with the audio sync, then guessed it was a foreign movie since I could not read the jacket ... Dialogue in English doubled. If they had chosen the right character to double the dialogue, this film could have been decent. I gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered that the bad line reader was not going to get killed, but was still the main device. Yes, it's so bad! The jacket and the art of the film are excellent, so gave a star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
