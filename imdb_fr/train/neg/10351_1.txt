This film has hardly followed the plot of the film. All the fascinating points of the book did not even exist in the film. They ended up making it a "biting" story of "movie between Disney" between Meg and Calvin. It was so serious Hillary Duff should have played the role, or one of his kind. This film was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney could even afford to make such a basic and cheap interpretation. If you have already read the book, I think you will agree that it could easily become an equivalence movie of "Lord of the Rings". This film should never have used the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Poorly done.
