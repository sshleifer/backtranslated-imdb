Despite the title, it seems to have little to do with devils and much more with a power-hungry ruler looking for the stone of the philosphere and wants gold made from lead (and virgin blood) . Jacinto Molina plays the role of Gilles de Lancre and does not seem to have any problem with people being put to death when he thinks to threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood. He is basically motivated by his love and an alchemist he uses and it's more greed and madness that seem to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are scenes that are at least a bit exciting, such as games and adult men trying to tip over with big sticks, and the film has at least one interesting aspect, but otherwise there is little to recommend. Little gore and nothing disturbing, and the most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy film, it's not really an unintentional humor. So, 4 out of 10.
