First, let me say that the first 20 minutes are excellent, that the monster is superb and that the CGI is reasonably finished. It is unfortunate that the rest of the film is such a disappointment. <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> The opening scene we see in this film is anti-American. Normally, this kind of stereotypes would not bother me (the British get enough in Hollywood), but here it's not subtle to make Americans brain weak. This is beyond realism and your left is wondering if a yank has violated the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The mourning scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts to get worse. <br /> <br /> Here, we meet Olympic medalist Auntie and his drunken uncle who enter the memorial and begin to blame the father for the death of his daughter, then beat him before they start crying. . An unrealistic connection in times of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole sideline of the virus is ridiculous. If Americans know there is no virus, why are they wasting time, money, and resources to investigate? The US government agent orders the drilling of an innocent Korean brain for nothing, which gives Americans a diabolical (or stupid) air. The fact that this guy has his eyes crossed for a comic effect did not help. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the monster hunt. The US and Korean special forces are responsible for finding the creature although they are invisible throughout the film. The only people that chase the monster, all over Korea, is the main family and some random tramps that appear in the end to save the situation! Naturally, some American / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was only included in the film to be able to achieve the essential stroke in the end. It was a cliche, you knew it was going to happen, but to make matters worse, she fucked everyone until then! and my last boredom, how on earth did this child survive in the end? the monster swam with his head under water for about 5 minutes! why did not the monster eat the kids in the first place?
