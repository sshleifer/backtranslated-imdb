Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite 80s cartoon. I enjoyed the first two seasons of the series as well as the special "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas 1992" Christmas. Some fans of Gadget do not hesitate to criticize the second season (1985) of the series, but they must compare it to the publication in 2002 by DiC of "The last case of the inspector Gadget: Claw's Revenge", to then find the second season absolute gold. . <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Gadget, I could not resist the opportunity to see Inspector Gadget animated in something that was unrelated to Gadget Boy. I bought the film and I swore I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be drawn from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I was going to watch. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a flap of the original series still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some of the disadvantages for this movie: * There is no humor in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (having originally an almost equal share in the series as Gadget) have been absent from action for fifteen years at twenty minutes apart. <br /> <br /> * The original music of Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is less than par. (Understand that Saban now has his own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets that made the series as endearing as the gadget -copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which was actually used but it was not even called the same thing), as well as his other classic gadgets for hat and for the hand. In this film, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. This kind of thing annoys the real fans of the series and simply does not require any change. <br /> <br /> * The original series gadget is now a fast convertible. All fans of the original series have loved the gadget by turning into a gadget van, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chef Quimby is now very keen or nasty for Gadget. He has always been grumpy in the original series, but it pushes the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny does not have a computer book anymore. <br /> <br /> Are there positives in this film? ? OK, that's it ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche is taking over from the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In a scene, chef Quimby is referring to a real villain in the cartoon series: the big Wambini (the nasty classic "gadget" of the second season, voiced by Louis Nye) . <br /> <br /> Looking for more reducing factors for this film? Well, you're out of luck. Life consists in making choices and living according to these choices. Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: respect the original formula! "If it is not broke, do not fix it." Real fans of gadgets should avoid this movie. you will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Let's hope DiC and Shout! After the release in 2006 of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1", Factory will continue to publish more original series containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of gadgets, love of 80s animation and many DiC programs, I strongly encourage you to buy the "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs. are excellent and sure to bring back good memories.
