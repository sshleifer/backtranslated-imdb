Now, I hired this film because Brad Dourif was there. He's an excellent actor, brilliant in everything ... except this movie. And I think it's only because he realized how stupid this movie was and he did not mind a good performance. This film is an involuntary comedy. Some lines make me crack. And there are lines that make no sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper throws lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW the plot is BAD! But this is one of those movies that is TAHT BAD and is really painful to watch. I recommend it only to big fans of Brad Dourif, or fans of other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
