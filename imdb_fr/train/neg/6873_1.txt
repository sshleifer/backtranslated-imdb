Television productions in the early 2000s were between weak and bad. Before brands like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), the television had not yet had the good hit, which could capture the attention and interests of the viewer of the 2000s. Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to watch and follow, or at least were not you as captivating and interesting on time as what preceded them. (Special Unit 2) is no exception. In fact, it's Men in Black and the parody of The X Files! (As if it were the special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; it did not work well. It was promising. at the time there was some saturation in the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X files already, so the demon's natural spirit was also ugly (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this area, or a strong one when it comes to making a comic series of science fiction. It was very ridiculous, where for example every sexy situation must turn into a disgusting and disgusting situation. He appreciated this disgusting bad taste. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and especially unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Of course, the series had a fun look, but overall it was a bit of a funny job. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among the other works of (Evan Katz) as co-author and co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24) later, this must be a low point !. Despite his distinctive personality, he has managed to be a ridiculous joke for most of the time. Therefore, if this was a goal, they made one of the most idiots! And really, it would be one of the rarest moments to be grateful for the cancellation of a show after only 19 episodes!
