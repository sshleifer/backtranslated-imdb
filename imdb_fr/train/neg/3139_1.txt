First of all, as a long-time student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I do not care how many awards and distinctions the film won, but for me, it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make an "appropriate" film about the disaster, but unfortunately he chose to turn it into a romantic porridge with a poetic face. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen into the trap only reflects, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that film critics and the public have today. Who said that all movies should have a hero and a heroine fall in love? In fact, most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster was certainly not one. I think we needed a better script and a better director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I nearly vomited in the last sequence where the "dead" lovers find themselves among the other lost passengers and the crew who burst into applause. Is it a smart movie? Ask yourself.
