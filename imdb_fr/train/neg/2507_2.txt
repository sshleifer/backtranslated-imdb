It's not a good movie. It's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times doing a lot better otherwise. Not to mention you can see each plot point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one has bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that she can not sing. But no matter, she is so beautiful. But I'm going astray, nothing new here. In the end, the group of excited girls is exploited, some people get hooked on drugs, some people hooked to a guy, some people go away, and the horrible incident happens. Surprise Surprise. Welcome to the world of music. I can not believe that so many people think it's a good movie. Many of you want to use a sliding scale to rank Black Movies. I do not play that! If you want to support these films by going to see them, it's great! If you enjoyed - great! Everyone to his own tastes. But do not try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I hope that people of color are not interested in these kinds of films simply because they present black actors. Do you want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the purple color. These would be great movies regardless of the skin color of the actors. Why? Because they told fascinating stories with excellent interpretation, it made you feel something long after you left the theater. Our experience does not automatically make this movie a good movie. It's only good - when it's good. Period.
