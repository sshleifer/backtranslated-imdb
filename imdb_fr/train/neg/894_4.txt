I just saw him yesterday at the International Film Festival of Sao Paulo. Just before leaving, I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a very good price ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, I was dying to go out (I never did that), but felt embarrassed to do so because the producer of the film was at the screening. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all, the dialogs are superficial and do not lead anywhere, the characters are less deep than the dialogues, nothing leads anywhere, and the worst and the worst: full of Siemens commercials and organic products on the film. Despite the fact that I have already paid to go to the film and amuse myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character who chats on the Internet and the Siemens mobile phone that pops up all the time on his computer; or another character taking a bath or cutting his hair just so that the Organics shampoo is displayed on the screen! All this would be bearable if the plot, the characters, the novels, everything was good, but it was bad, really bad! A sex "I do not know how to do" sex-in-the-city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money.
