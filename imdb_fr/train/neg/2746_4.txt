I dreaded taking my nephews into this film because I did not think everything would be done well. Children 6 and 10 years old were ready to see him, so I gave in. I must admit that it was not as bad as I had thought, but was still far from the book. The film seemed to go well with the understanding and sense of humor of the 10-year-old girl. I found that the 6-year-old understood what was happening and presented solutions to the problems that arose. I finally had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems, because it's more fun to watch what happens if they make "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
