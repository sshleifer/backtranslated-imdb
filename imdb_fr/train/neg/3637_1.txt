I am stunned by the positive reviews about this film totally devoid of sensuality. <br /> <br /> Often, with foreign films, I skip critics who complain about the slowness and seeming "lack of action", unlike most of the best international films at the height of the model western Hollywood film narrative. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the frequent tips and lack of clich√©s in the field of foreign film. I appreciate the fact that many foreign films do not put things in place in a nice little bow. <br /> <br /> That said, this particular movie offered no reductive value for the time I lost watching it. No significant character development, no captivating story, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A gang of prejudiced, immobile and emotional colonists mistreat their slaves, and a little girl hurts her only friend when the "house boy" finally gets fed up with them take it to him. . <br /> <br /> Although the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this film will bother you while playing the script. I was so little engaged that it took three sessions to finish it and I would not even have done that without the positive notes. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest for this period, I strongly suggest you depart from it.
