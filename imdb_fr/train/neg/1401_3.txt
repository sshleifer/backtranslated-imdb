Someone mentioned editing. This is poorly edited and what began as somewhat intriguing has become an incomprehensible mess. To begin, tell us what you are trying to do with these experiences. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experimentation in which they are involved? And what exactly are they testing? Apparently, a big plan will be operated by an agency. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone emits. Everyone keeps secrets. They often mention that without the money they would hang it up. There is a disturbed minister who casts scriptures. Again and again. But, again, the biggest problem is the lack of a playground for actors. There are really tacky elements. These small rooms and these lounge chairs. The terrible wallpaper (was it a wallpaper?). It was interesting, but did not seem to go anywhere.
