Like many other Bachchan fans, I was looking forward to Sholay's remake. This movie was not that. Thank God, they did not let them use the name "Sholay" in the title of the movie. The remake of Ram Gopal is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the places, the costumes, the dance totally displaced, the dialogues combine to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the actors agreed to make this film because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the actors. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first film. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous. Did he need money to pay for the marriage with Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or DVD when it comes out.
