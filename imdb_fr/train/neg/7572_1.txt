It was as if I was watching this movie thousands of times before. It was absolutely predictable. Whenever the story tried to twist a little, every time I waited for something interesting, I saw only what I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another facility because there was not enough bread". In two words: A flat story, which has become a clich√©, a bad acting, bad effects ... Only the stupid Russian cop, Vlad, was a bit funny punishing the bad guys. The pile of muscles was incredibly STUPID, that made me laugh for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting on this shameful film ... It will not get worse (because it's not possible): D
