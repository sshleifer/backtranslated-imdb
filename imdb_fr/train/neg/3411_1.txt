Mix exotic tropical places, girls dressed in skinny clothes, explosions, pretty clones of Dudley Do-Right, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), some martial arts and a sexy nasty (.... sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you'd think you'd like to have fun. Not so! It's a dreary TV movie and even if it pretends to be a "Charlie's Angels Accord", it's not nearly as good as the original series or even the stunning, incredibly stupid, recent CA movies . This abomination is described as a THIRD RATE movie by Andy Sidaris. No one's as much fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some fight scenes are quite worthy. The girls spend too much time posing and trying, they look bored and boring after a while. There are better genre stuff than that. Oh yes, and the "babies" are not as exciting as they think. Terrible soundtrack ... when he's here.
