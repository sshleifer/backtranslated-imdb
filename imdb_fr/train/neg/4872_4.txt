A collection of animal jokes claiming that "Babe" was never made on the production line; the writers clearly hoped that the gadget of seeing the animals talking would be enough to advance the film. It's not. Eddie Murphy finds himself again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the incessant and unconscious gossip of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The voice is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the screenplay is so unimaginative, unattractive and depressing that the whole thing is going fast enough .
