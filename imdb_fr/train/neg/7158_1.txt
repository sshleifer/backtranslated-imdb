This is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. I love Nadja d'Almereyda, but it's only absolute sinking. Aside from some interesting moments in cinematography and music, this film is simply a bad movie and a dumb material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but nobody in this field is really good. The plot is a joke, but not haha. I do not even know if you can forgive such bad movies. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director create Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
