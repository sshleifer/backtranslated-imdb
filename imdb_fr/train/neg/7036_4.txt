I do not waste anything when I inform you that you have the opportunity to see a woman sleeping with a goat in this movie. If that's your case, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go to see her sister separated in the family manor located in the woods. Her sister is a scary lady, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. On the side, a group of disreputable characters introduces themselves and starts playing all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak and the characters are rather stupid. The woman stays around, even after her husband begins to turn into a fool and go out with the pagans, even continues to have sex with him. In terms of exploitation, there is a lot of bare flesh and some perverse couplings, but nothing has been better elsewhere. Oh, and the aforementioned goat sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not reach the end. Farmers will abandon it, but will not want it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
