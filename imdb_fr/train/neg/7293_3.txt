Aaron Spelling produced this Western film for television, which becomes a terrible conspiracy for a seventy-three-minute film. It looks like a pilot probably missed the show. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Clint Walker, US Marshal Dave Harmon, who is walking in Yuma, Arizona Territory, in time to kill one of the Bigwig's local breeder's brothers who came out . a trail. <br /> <br /> Walker takes his other brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican kid sleeping in the prison. One night, Andres is dozing off when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the brother in the street and kill him, pinning Walker's murder. Not good for your first twenty-four hours of work. Walker visits the local army fort and shakes the commander's chains. The bigwig learns of the death of his brothers and returns to the city in time to shave his chains also. The local indigenous population, who is being bullied by the military on his beef, is also affected in the chains business. Walker still has time to woo the owner of the hotel. The type of army involved in the murder is dead, the local cattle buyer is involved, the Indians make a lot of hesitant speeches, and the climax causes an unlikely confrontation, as Walker has to prove to the city that the buyer Naughty cattle had a boss, someone we suspected was too useful from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a secondary semi-plot involving the death of the Walker family at the hands of the army raiders, and I think that would have been the force behind the series, had it been picked up. Instead, the film ends abruptly and I continued to wait for the scenes of the exciting episode of next week. Due to the gradual disappearance of non-existent commercial breaks, the pace is good, and its history is complicated. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, sturdy and has a deeper voice than a well. The rest of the cast is filled with TV actors that you've probably seen in other TV movies. Much of the action is rather lame and the violence is lukewarm. The first killed brother suffers a shotgun blast and falls without a scratch. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but it's not the right movie to use to teach kids gun sickness! Speaking of children, the Mexican kid goes very quickly from "cute" to "annoying aneurism" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like westerns, then you will not like "Yuma". If you like westerns, then you will still not like "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This has not been evaluated, but contains physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
