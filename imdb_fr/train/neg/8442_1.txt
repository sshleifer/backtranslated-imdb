GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> The mouse Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who discovers that her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she does not cheat on her. She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents and her sister. So we have a main character in a feature film that does not do much. We hardly know anything about his background or his motives. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a stalemate, not just during this difficult episode of her life. Obviously, she is suffering from something, but why should the public suffer as well? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up cinema after seeing this unassailable mess. It was 90 minutes very boring and painful. Normally, I try to avoid wasting energy in a bad realization. I'll take the shot and roll with the punches, but in this case, a fair warning is in place. How did Nanouk Leopold get funding (largely publicly funded) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak. This could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematic ideas or a cast with a little more appeal. Not at all, just a vaguely defined concept: "I want to do something from a woman's point of view." The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a feminine perspective of life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is no interesting plan to find throughout the movie. I can not think of a cast that could spice up this one, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this glaring lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to lead Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness." A perfect remedy for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late at night, it's guaranteed to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
