This is a terrible remake of a marginal film, but very popular, from the early 70's. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute film "piled up" in 2 hours or whatever the duration. Scenario cheesy, which by the way, is completely different from the original. The major participation of the government was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original, you could go for a beer or go to the bathroom while staying up. <br /> <br /> It took just a few hours of film to change the car's oil pan. It takes a lot more time than that in real life. The guys in the car are noticing that kind of thing. In addition, the fool or fools who have chosen to destroy a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should receive a dull ball in the heel. The fact that they are not "motorists" is painfully obvious and their death will not hurt. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the radio DJ said the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). It's the total trash. Can you say aerodynamic, or the lack of it? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time looking at this one.
