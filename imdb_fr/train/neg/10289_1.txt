This should really deserve an "O" or even a negative ten. I watched this show for centuries, and the show jumped the shark around the 7 series. This episode is however proof that the show has jumped the shark. It's a lazy, absurd, complacent writing that does not even deserve garbage like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It's totally possible to be ridiculous and always be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy, Comte of Monte Cristo - all the "funny" movies that should not be taken at serious. However, there is something as ridiculous as in "it's the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, it's the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. It's absolutely awful, and it comes from someone who has a door of stars in his basement. <br /> <br /> makes me want to sell all my accessories, very seriously.
