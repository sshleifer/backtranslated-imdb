This story about three women is a very sensitive study on: Muriel (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (El Dot Dotmans), about 37 years old, and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the eldest, mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël is from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a girl. In fact, nothing happens in this film, so you're waiting for something - for example an accident - that could dramatize this story. As you go along, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case. We are left with a feeling of emptiness.
