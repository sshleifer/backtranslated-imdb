It's way worse than those terrible 1960s Laurel and Hardy cartoons. They were awful, but at least they were simple swindles from the resurgence of Stan and Ollie. A new audience rediscovered the comic genius of the pair and the caricatures were a mind-boggling trash designed to promote the interest of the children. It was to be expected. But how can one even try to rationalize this work of ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the manufacturers were hoping it would inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not spark the interest of the past with a superficial and unpleasant caricature of what made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) make a Vegas issue and that's what it belongs to. The plot is even more fragile than those used in the past, trying to extend the two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was the first REAL Laurel and Hardy show, I'm sure the viewer would reject the original duo's reputation as crazy senility. The only movie I hate worse than that is I SPIT ON GRAVE. And, you know, these filmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie.
