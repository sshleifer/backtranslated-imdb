I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel like I have to do it after watching the Batman animation. His absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animated series at Batman in the early '90s, so what the heck do they do to try and play with the winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and dark, just like Batman was supposed to be. WB must have ruined this with Batman of the Future guts. Now they produce this drivel. The Joker does not look remotely like the DC Comics Joker. DC should continue. I urge anyone who agrees with me to send an email or WB and use the power of people to recover the original formula
