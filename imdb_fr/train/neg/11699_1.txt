The plot of The Thinner is decidedly slim. And disgusting. An obese lawyer drives on the Gypsy woman, and the curse of Gypsies makes her lose weight ... and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, Gypsy's curses should be fun, but losing weight went wrong? Nope. Except that Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and screenwriter of this catastrophic movie, does it too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha! Thinner is like an immature shit for a person who complains that he has never seen anything as disgusting as fat. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
