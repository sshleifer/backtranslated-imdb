For some strange reason, the world of cinema is driven by fashion. Someone makes a movie about a killer shark, and suddenly the world's oceans are flooded with giant squids, murderous octopuses and sea monsters of all kinds. A man is hunted by a former lover of hell, then every character in the movie is hunted down by a hell policeman or a hell roommate or a baby sitter from hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company produces a high-budget blockbuster on tornadoes, and then other film producers join them, the fact that they do not have the budget to do it does not stop them. NUIT DES TWISTERS is an example. What strikes me in this movie is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by reducing commercial breaks. Whenever a tornado appears, the camera locks on the horrified expression of actors shouting things such as "Oh, my God, it's like that" and "Run for your life", then the screen. erases, thus saving the producers. the special effects budget. Unfortunately, the budget of NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS should have been increased to include better actors. The actors are not bad, but they are unimpressive and lack the talent to make a movie based on the characters. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word to say that it is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been for several months as being the blockbuster of the summer of 1996 and NOTT has a feeling in a hurry, which leads me to believe that it was designed and published to be related to the hype surrounding TWISTER
