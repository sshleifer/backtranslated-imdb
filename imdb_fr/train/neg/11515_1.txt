and forget that. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna play, praise "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in that one. <br /> <br /> In this film, even if the sets are beautiful, you can turn off the dialogue. . You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is an accessory, and Madonna is so awful that she becomes fun. Why they had to shoot the original movie in this mess, I'll never know; suppose they thought it was bankable. Madonna, as an actress, is certainly not. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie of 1979, you will appreciate it and the actors who compose it will be able to play. 1/10.
