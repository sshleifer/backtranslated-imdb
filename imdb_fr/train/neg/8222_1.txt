Uh ... Okay, I guess I master all the shooting technique like a gorilla, but unfortunately, I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a mess complete from the start. Bad game, bad staging, bad history and horrible cinematography. I'll never know how this trash was released, but she did it and unfortunately I looked at it. Filmed locally in Tennessee by the staging team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes" is supposed to look like a film like "Blair Witch", but at the limit. .. Okay it's nose diving from a cliff. In fact, I was embarrassed for these young women, to whom, I am sure, the celebrity in Hollywood, but found themselves in this clutter. The dialogue is ridiculous and makes you worse when you listen to it. How this is supposed to be a horror movie is another mystery because there is nothing very scary about it, other than the fact that I watched it ... Try this one for size: there are 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass ... "The End". Unfortunately, it took another 95 minutes of agonizing stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw her for free and wanted to get my money back.
