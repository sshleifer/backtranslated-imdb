Stefan is an x-con who married Mary five years ago. Their marriage was stable until Stefan caught up with them and he offered to do a mail job. Stefan's job is a delivery of heroin from Germany to Sweden that should go easily. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a Bosnian girl who was sold to a strip club owner. Stefan does not like what he sees and decides to help Elli get out of his misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fled to Sweden, Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up for the past, Stefan promised Elli to help him find his father no matter what. Finally, back in Sweden, the situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan had ever thought .. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to be part of the category of ordinary Swedish films because of its Americanization a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist average, the effects make the film a little too much. See and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
