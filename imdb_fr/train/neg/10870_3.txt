Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid three women: Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to chaperone him and make sure he does not fall under the influence of gold diggers. One of these women, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), went to the scene, much to the chagrin of women. We follow the story when the girls are offered more money to participate in a show instead of the escort role they agreed to play during Bill's three-month stay in New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end, there is love in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> The quality of the image and the quality sound are mediocre in this film. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not so good either. It's nice enough but really only comes to life when playing drums or trombone. There is a very irritating character who plays the role of a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is just boring.
