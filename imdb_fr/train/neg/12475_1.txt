I do not remember going out of a movie theater except this time. Plus, I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An irrelevant plot, clay characters, endless violence. I did not care about the death of good guys; I did not care when the bad guys had it. The fantasy and the magic were spread on pudding with the liver and there was no coherence. In short, good entertainment if you spend an eternity in hell.
