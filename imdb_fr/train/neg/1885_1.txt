If you're looking for a movie, it describes the useless and boring existence of middle-class lives in a network of non-communication and false ideals, so this movie is for you. If you also want the film to be engaging and keep your interest, you should probably go elsewhere. There are a lot of movies that do that a lot better. For example, try some of Bergman's darkest movies. The director felt that, to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should subject the viewer to a dull and empty atrocious incident until the film finally comes to an end tortuous and pathetic. If you enjoy your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, for example, cleaning your house.
