I am happy that people at IMDb have been able to decipher the genre in which this film is located. I suspected it was a comedy, but since he also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, he is surprisingly devoid of any adventure in the world of humor - until the ridiculous end "twist", which confirms the total loss of time of the film. It is difficult to describe the degree of amateurism of THE HAZING. Did anyone involved in this film have any idea what he was supposed to do? It is definitely worth watching to watch the screen with a stupid skeptic about the gravity of the situation.
