Terrible film. If there is a Turkish film that you should avoid seeing in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Except for some laughter, this movie gives nothing, nada, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap and sexual clich√©s are ubiquitous. The director must watch more movies before attempting to make his own film. Women with red heads show examples of what an actress should not do. If you want to learn not to act, this is a perfect example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I really did not like to write about it. Jeez!
