I am not a big fan of rom / coms at the best of times. Some have been pretty good (Dream control for an insomniac), but this one is a little bit the same but less. <br /> <br /> With a race time of 100 minutes, I expect more than one laugh every 30 minutes. . The only real laugh in the belly comes when strangers and male friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee you that there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that you deserve $$ 3/10 (and only because I'm a big fan of Lee)
