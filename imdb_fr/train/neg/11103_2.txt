OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was usually a decent movie, with the exception of the script, which was stupid and awful ... All First, we never know anything about creatures, why did they appear, do they in our world, and actually, did they ever come to Earth before us or did they just come from space? Second, the role of the butcher in policing is so obviously created ... In fact, what would be the size of the sub-base of a substation? Since there were only a very small number of these creatures, I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just laid tactical bombs, or maybe cleaning the place and a Nuke would have do the work. I know it sounds funny and it's true, but I do not consider that the killing of people is NECESSARY ... Third, Leon acts as Superman jumping on the train and fights Vinnie Jones, who was much larger and bigger. Again, when he faces the conductor, he does nothing and acts like a towel, watching over all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor got a scary help (lol), but if Leon was so brave, he'd go all the way ... I mean he risked his life first, then do nothing exactly as it should have been. He could have died like a hero, but live like a coward ... that may be the case, but not after having shown so much courage before ... So, the cop ... Come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet there must be other cops that this lady, other police stations, it was really a bit ridiculous ... In short, great actor Vinnie Jones , interesting idea to the reason behind it is what is not really built at all ... By the way, what were the signs on the chest? Vinnie Jones can not catch up with the rest ...
