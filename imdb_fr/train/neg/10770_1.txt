May contain spoilers (nothing in this movie is new or might even surprise you slightly) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they've turned into an oversight? Of course it's cheaper for them, but after a while, would not you think that the overall quality and the way people think about them would fall. House Of Villains is a despicable showcase of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense. Here are some signs of the total disregard of previous films: The voices are not alike and Iago is again perverse (since when ?!) I know that these films are directly aimed at children, but there was a time when enjoy all the movies Disney. Even the movie's music number (which has been Disney's specialty for years) is really bad. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even the youngest. All I can say is that if several movies of the same caliber come out, it's only a matter of time before a small animation studio surpasses Disney in general quality.
