So, it starts with a beautiful old house in the countryside. You have a group of people who are asked to come into this house and (unsurprisingly) the guards always lock the doors at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke, etc. This doctor tells them a scary story of this woman and some children. They are afraid, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees the ghost. A little more conversation as this huge ghost arrives, etc. etc. This girl discovers that this ghost has killed young children and that she has to release their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does it but, oh no, she dies like her. And go to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape from the house. The scenario is terrible because a guy gets his head cut off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the children) says "oh no". The acting game is wooden, the effects are shit and the set is a couple of pieces used over and over again. Basically, if you like to make fun of poorly made movies, watch it, but if you're looking for a scare, do not miss this movie. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big disappointment. My sister (who becomes sacred very easily) was bored in this film it is terrible.
