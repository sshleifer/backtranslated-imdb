Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, his role required no. She did not say much and seemed pale throughout the movie. Luise's character was a slave then married to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Located in ancient Asia, the two actors were not Asian, but their roles were very convincing. I hope Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that's why Luise had to get it. She must have been a revolutionary actress, one of the first to act methodically. It seems like something Hollywood does often. Al Pacino played an Italian and a Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance was dull all the way through, and when she died, she did not change her expression from previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If his brilliant game was so subtle, I guess I did not see it.
