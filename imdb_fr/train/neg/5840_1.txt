Well. I just watched a bunch of movies - all with different degrees of quality. I was not too sure of the one I wanted to look at first. Then he hit me like a rat bag: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity does not look at anyone and is painfully boring. And it's about mutant rats killing people. Yeah ... really original. "Food of the gods" or "Willard", do you like it? These were better than that, and that does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Well, here's the story: Inna Lab, the scientist and his brave assistant, do experiments on rats and their lab is in a neighborhood and a crappy building and brave wizard's foolish friends get drunk and everyone becomes food for crazy rats and just about everyone dies and, oh yeah, there's a giant rat that looks like shit, but he's killed, the end. There, all in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I do not agree! The second we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know he will die one day! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I looked at it for free, but for everyone ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt him, I did not help: <br /> <br /> - Uh ... well. the gore was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> --CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> In other planes, CG rats were pathetically very cheap. Listen, if your movie is on a budget, you may not want to rely on CG. Lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> - The acting is extremely mediocre. <br /> <br /> - The characters are uninteresting - we have a mix of clich√©s and none of them are even done as well. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Well done before - a lot of times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The giant rat looks like a fat man dressed in a badly designed bear costume - it was pretty funny - but not funny enough to give this movie all its value. <br /> <br /> --Failed, unrealistic and boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> - All students who eat rats drink Tequila in huge plastic milk cans - yet they do not seem to be drunk any longer than a few seconds. Way to stay in continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you could imagine. It's not even ridiculously bad like, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these movies are crap, you can enjoy it. Even if it makes you stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - The end of the lame action movie ends with heroes and an explosion without wounds. Because he did not look like the rest of this monstrosity at all - but it was nil. <br /> <br /> Actor: 2/10 History: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I had the opportunity to take care of my son from time to time during the film, so I may have missed it, but I was supposed to be there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for the time) Writing: 1/10 Achievement: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Playfulness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> > Total: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Only look at it if you like horror movies made from rats and vermin. Wait ... Check this. Do not look at him. It's shit. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
