Chris Rock, apparently looking for a comfy starworthy vehicle that would appeal to the black and white audience, updates the hit comedy "Heaven Can Wait" in 1978 with an urban agenda. He plays a comedian in trouble involved in a car accident and whose soul is removed too early from his body. Therefore, his angels must find another body in which to place him and can only find that of a white businessman. Rewrite a film as bland and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" just shows that Rock had an eye on the box office (it was strictly a corporate movement organized by the most mercenary Hollywood players). Why not look for something more noble or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that ends with a party at the Apollo? Major actors (including Regina King, the formidable Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and Frankie Faison) are doing what they can, but Rock seems embarrassed and unsure of himself. * 1/2 of ****
