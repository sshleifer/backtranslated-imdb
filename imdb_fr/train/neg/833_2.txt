There really was not a lot of story in this movie. He has vaguely based on the events of the first film of the Lion King. It's supposed to be the way Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> He mixes some scenes of the original, then explains in detail how this film has modified them a little. But still, is that it? I was hoping for something more. Instead, all I need to show is an empty plot, with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then that's it. But apart from that, it does not do justice to the animators. Disney should really stop these productions directly on video. It was really boring and I could have used Jason Statham. "RE-"
