After seeing men behind the sun, I was hoping to have an evolution of style and technique corresponding to the larger scale of this film. I was also very interested to see someone make a fictitious, fact-based account of what happened during the most famous of Japanese atrocities, but that's not it. It looks like a European Nazi exploitation movie of the 70s going from the bottom to the middle - for example. SS experiment camp, etc. (perhaps more like women deported from the special section). While it has a greater reach and more people running, but it uses the same cheap and joyless device many unfortunate non-actors who fall limply to the sound of ridiculously false shootings, spiced with a "shock" sometimes poorly executed. sequence. The documentary film, certainly horrible, is split roughly between scenes so haunted that even these real images are stripped of much of their power. Watch The Holocaust from Channel 4 (recently aired (still in progress?) As of 1 st 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary on the evils of war (with excellent use in the context of real-life images). This is the kind of treatment that the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this waste of exploited waste (a better executed film of exploitation, less the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been acceptable, but again, this is not even a very good operating film). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
