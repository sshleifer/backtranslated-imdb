The worst DCOM I've seen. Already. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. It was just bad. The acting and the story were good, but the effects SUCED! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene in which I was excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very boring and the film suddenly stopped. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and a fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
