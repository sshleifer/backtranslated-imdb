This movie has an exchange feature. At some point, after a character is attacked by a fairy brandishing an ax, her brother asks her, "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" After suffering for almost an hour of bad film, this drink almost made my glass come out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are not so bad, but the kids stink all and PJ Soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this movie. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates) that he should do. <br /> <br /> Of course, many points in history do not fit. For example, in a scene, ghosts of young children must focus to move a physical object in order to prove their existence, which is difficult because they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, a few minutes later, they all pick up branches and hit the Tooth Fairy with them. Apparently, they can sometimes move the material and sometimes they can not. Go understand. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and guts, however ... some beautiful breasts. But that does not make up for the inconvenience. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, go rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, although many other critics do not share my opinion. At least it creates an atmosphere.
