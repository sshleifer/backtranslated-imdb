Oh my God! Please, for the sake of all that is holy, do not watch this movie! I will never come back in the 82 minutes of my life. Of course, I could have stopped looking halfway. But I thought it could get better. He does not have. Anyone who has really enjoyed this film is a seriously ill and twisted individual. No wonder we, Australians / New Zealanders, have a bad reputation in filmmaking. Everything is horrible in this film, from acting to editing. Normally, I do not even write reviews, but in this case I will make an exception. I just want someone to warn me before I commit this disaster
