A "friend", clearly tasteless and classless, suggested I take a look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I do not want to see anything of him. They are amateur refuse, complaisant, modest and complacent. The "fucking prostitute" is a low-budget, angry filmmaker who is murdering a group of prostitutes. There is some nudity and some erections, but nothing could save that from the executioner's knot. The lighting is appalling, the dialogue is childish and mainly shouted, and the direction is distraught. At the recent Fangoria convention, I saw a documentary about American directors. Atkins was one of those presented. He said there was something important in his work, but after watching this, I can not see anything to import. There is no style either, and horrible video effects (like solarization) only amplify the amateur side. Not even if it's fun. To avoid.
