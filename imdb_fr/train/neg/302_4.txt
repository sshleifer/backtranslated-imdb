I really wanted to love this movie. I love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a lovely side. Not that I like Spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should let kenny and his girlfriend star in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's rather boring except for a scene with Roger Ebert. There really are not a lot of celebrities in this movie, and most do not seem to say more than one line. Overall, this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest to watch it if you get it with kenny vs spenny's Season 1 DVD (it's available for free on the third disc). Regardless of this production, I am always very excited to discover The Papel Chase.
