This is just typical of Bruce Willis, action movie schtick. Watch it with popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. Battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character speak to Willis from the transporter's pontoon? What's up with that? He can not do it from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. is wounded with a machete. There are a lot of medium explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie faithfully represents the Navy SEALS, then do not get stuck in Africa, expect them to come and save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village has bothered me the most. "In the front row of seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the city massacre. So, what is he doing? He crawls in the city on his belly. Yes. How many died while they were walking? Oh well ... you had to count, I guess. <br /> <br /> And if this African guy was so important, why did not he get on the helicopter with the elderly and the kids? Can he say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. Not only in the plot, but so much happens at night that it was hard to understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> Praise him.
