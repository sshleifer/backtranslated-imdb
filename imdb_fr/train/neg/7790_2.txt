Like some of the people who watched this movie, I was also nostalgic about it ... before having the misfortune to see it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this movie were completely untrustworthy and The Perils of Pauline proves to be an embarrassing exercise in making banal, racist and boring movies. Even the presence of former pros, Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas, can not defeat a rancid scenario, a horrible theme song and miserable "special effects." In addition, stereotypical representations of African and Arab characters make reading painful, especially since it was produced immediately after the civil rights movement. The original Psychotronic encyclopedia by Michael Weldon reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably resulted in a theatrical release. Judging by the results, this is a totally credible (and confusing) scenario.
