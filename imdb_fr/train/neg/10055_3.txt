I grew up with the theatrical version "Superman II" ("S2T") and, as a child, I loved it more than the first part, because not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type bad guys, but it started with a bang? ? the best transformations and rescue scenes from Clark Kent to Superman. Children no longer had to wait anxiously for Superman to appear on the screen, as in Part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how the powerful fell with S2T (See: my review.) I have always heard of the back-story of how they prematurely and unjustifiably dismissed the director of the original, Part II, Richard Donner. (It was rare at the time to simultaneously shoot two separate movies, and now it's common: "Back to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 & 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut ( or, S2RD ") I still can not recommend it completely Superman's big change scene, the Paris rescue, and the wonderful recap of the first part of the opening of S2T have disappeared. all wrote the words: "Previously on Superman ??" in S2RD The special effects were not great, neither in Part I nor in S2T, but S2RD, they were mostly downright ludicrous, like Lois falling from the window of the Daily Planet I admit that some new scenes have worked and that some of them have come out are welcome departures, such as any scene from the "honeymoon suite." Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did e Did you like it as a child? I'm not nervous like an adult, but you should definitely see S2RD because it's almost a whole new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: S2T's weird amnesic kiss has also been replaced by the exact end of "I." It's not just a lazy and original copout, it makes no sense to say why Clark would go back to dinner if these events never happened. And will he continue to "go back in time" for each confrontation?
