Honey's franchise, I Shrunk the Kids was a huge deal and not to say very famous. I loved honey, I narrowed the kids when I was little. It was an original story and an exciting plot! The sets were so incredible and the actors seemed to like each other's company. Now, darling, I blew up the kid who was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to get back to the story everyone liked. <br /> <br /> By and large, Adam is a little bigger now and the mother goes on vacation to leave their husband with their children. But when Wayne's favorite object is threatened, he wants to reduce it and keep it, but he and his brother intervene. But when the women come back after having forgotten to give medicine to their son, they are taken to the machine, leaving the children alone at home! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but as I said, it was just a family film that I think some might have fun. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend this one at least to Honey, I raised the film all the time, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
