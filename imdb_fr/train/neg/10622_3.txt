I actually have a penchant for Christopher Lee, but it just was not up to his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not respect its principles. It's not so scary, it's too melodramatic, and that's draaaaaags. Whenever I thought "Oh, here's the good part", the good part never arrived. <br /> <br /> Evil is not convincing at all. Most other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had been in a proper state of mind, I might have appreciated some of the benefits to the detriment of this movie, but .... Naaahhh ... Ne did not really seem worth it. It was not really very good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
