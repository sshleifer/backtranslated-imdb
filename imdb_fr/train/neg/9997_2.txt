Captain Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are supposed to be a hot topic on this journey to death; a luxurious 747 airliner decorated to look like a disco-slash-hotel ?? there is even a blind pianist who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysteric b! $ 3 & will do everything to attract the attention of her husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and, later, the rest of the people on board. <br /> <br /> Memorable Moments: A Boeing 747 making a stomach belly in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen breaks her chops when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become "ball bearings" in a "flipper flowing". /> The action and rescue sequences are relatively phenomenal, but there is not much between them. Hitchcock was supposed to have realized this sequel, but I forget the reason why not ?? He would have done wonders for the original of 1970, on which this suite is partly inspired ('77 is also inspired by "The Flight of the Phoenix"). <br /> <br /> The actors Cotten and de Havilland gather their time on "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte" (apparently, they do not play heavy, they are simply reunited? Lover of the autumn years) . And is not the actress playing Emily's mate the same as the one who played the role of a housekeeper hammered to death in "Whatever happens to Baby Jane?" <br /> <br /> Among the television actors are the friend of "Mayberry RFD" (her character's daughter wins a drawing contest, or something like that lame), Gil Gerard 'Buck Rogers and Pamela Bellwood of 'Dynasty'. <br /> <br />
