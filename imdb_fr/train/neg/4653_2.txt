A vampire's henchman wants to call him after falling in love with a five-dollar whore in this low-budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I'm going to talk about mass hallucinations, but it's still disconcerting. The only factor that redeems (and I am extremely generous here) could be the grandfather who is the only semi-sympathetic character in all this mess. Do not waste your money or time. In fact, here's a tip: If Troma puts it on DVD, but does not do it himself, it's likely to be shit. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: commentary with Omar and Kirk; second comment with deleted scenes and actors; bloopers; troma interactivity; radiological walk; Excerpt from "Terror Firmer"; Theatrical trailer; trailers for "little girls", "Teen catgirls in heat", "Cannibal: the musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> My note: D
