The Japanese sense of stimulation, editing and musical score must be different from American tastes, but this film could surely have been more with a little more post-production work. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood has to do this movie and I think it would be a great success. The story is interesting and scary. There is something about the outskirts of the city, bitter policemen, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious seawater killings that are enough to be captivating. However, this story must have a little sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I must say that the effect "sixth sense" was in full force in this film, and this was obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> At the moment, only hardcore Japanese moviegoers should bother to see this film so boring.
