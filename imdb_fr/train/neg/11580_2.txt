If you want to see a mystery, do not look at it. Even if there are elements that come straight out of Elmore Leonard's territory, it looks more like an episode of "Dynasty", since the filmmaker focuses on the "character development" - that is, of long boring discussions between stupid characters and without implication. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in it.
