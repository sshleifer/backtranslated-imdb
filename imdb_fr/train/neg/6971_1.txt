Count Floyd gets noticed every sixty seconds. One way or another, they brought together Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty on a set and could not travel less than five miles, about eight kilometers, from a real movie . BOY does that suck? There is not an original line, thought, shot or effect of the opening sequence without a brain to closing without a brain. Susan Anspach, magical and aerial Five Pieces Easy - Boring. Steve Railsback - annoying. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. Buttercream Gang is a Thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation. Usually it's in the opening credits - "Written, directed and produced by" a guy. Or at the very center of the action is a so unskilled bimbo that you know there is one and only one reason this turkey was made. Here, you will not discover it before the very last credit, where the cooperation of a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian government is greatly appreciated. <br /> <br /> I'm watching MST take Beast of Yucca Flats for me to taste. Ghod, what an improvement.
