I rented this film because it comes from the genres "romance" and "western" with some landscapes of the Grand Canyon. But if you're expecting a typical western western, forget it. This film is a pure trash! The romance is between a girl who has not yet crossed puberty and a middle-aged man! The child is also coveted by other thirsty men. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as virtuous in trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is primarily the one who pursues the relationship. He tries to chase her at first, but he finally gives in and they leave as a happy and affectionate couple. It's revolting. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film could please everyone, except pedophiles.
