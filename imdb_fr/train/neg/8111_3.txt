Another great Costa-Gavras film. This is an excellent presentation of the situation in Latin America and the United States participation in Latin American politics. The facts may be inaccurate or accurate, but it is a fact that the United States was deeply involved in the coups and supported the Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the spirit of the film follows the typical leftist communist communism. propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, it portrays US actions as brutal and inhumane, while portraying Tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States be involved. Europe is full of poor prostitutes from Eastern Europe. I have never heard of poor Chilean or Uruguayan girls who prostitute themselves en masse, as in most Eastern European countries. The United States was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is unfortunate that the United States has been forced to do what it has done in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play badly. It is not an idealistic world, as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros believe. If Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In short, this film follows the corrupt and bankrupt ideology of the past and tries to make it look idealistic and morally. correct.
