This film looks pretty much like what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and sex scenes (pretty tame)! The film is not sure what it wants to be and almost ends up in a mess. It's more expensive than most of Al Adamson's films but it's not at the same level of budget that viewers expect Sci-Fi movies to come true. The actors are rather bad and unlike most of Adamson's films, there is no old big name or actor B. Some music is acceptable, but it's easy to understand why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten since so many years.
