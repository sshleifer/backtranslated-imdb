Beno√Æt (11), Luke Benward (Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In his new school, the young Benward is chosen by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Mastering his nauseated reflex, Benward casts a worm at the freckle hitter Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). Benward bet he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! Hallie Kate Eisenberg (like Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. The director and former writer of SCTV, Bob Dolman, promised: "No worm was hurt in the making of this film." In a related note, the SCTV star, Andrea Martin, has a fun scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat salty warmies (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luc Benward, Adam Hicks, Kate Eisenberg Hallie, Alexander Gould
