"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is hogwash. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that the majority of IMDb users gave it a 10. It's really horrible. No gore, no suspense, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely lost, the basic cast is also terrible.Yes, some people might like this picture, especially a traditional society, but hardcore horror or gore- hounds will not be able to appreciate this piece of shit. Personally, I hate horror comedies, I prefer to watch serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left" In my opinion, a real movie of Horror is supposed to be scary, excessively bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, which generally spoils the whole concept. This movie is not scary, is not gore, is not even funny as comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
