I can not believe that this show is always ranked 9 out of 10. I could see if these votes took place in the first 2 seasons, but what could we still have to continue to rank well after? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, the suspense, the unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. In season 2, I always looked closely, but I became a little frustrated that some basic things had not been explained yet. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw a bone from time to time to people to make them look. Now, I do not even remember what finally stopped me, but somewhere in season 2, I get tired of it. I'm not a big fan of appointment consulting - and you obviously can not miss an episode to stay on top of what's going on. So it was not worth it for me anymore. <br /> <br /> Too bad they could not have been smarter and more considerate towards their loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it seems that ABC has become too greedy and decided to see how long they could stretch this show. Do not they realize that in the end they will lose more fans than they can win.
