I have read some of the other comments and agree with those who have not had the end. I thought it was going pretty well ... until the end. He kept your mind running and then splat. I have no idea what happened in the last two minutes of the movie except a complete mess. It's as if they ran out of money to find a good ending so they improvised. They first had a mysterious project to make people disappear, then they had a guy who was talking about Area 51 (which makes you think of aliens), then it became a shit. I thought the actors and actresses were doing well, but the scenario had gone bad. Anyway, if you watch this movie, get ready to be disappointed in the end.
