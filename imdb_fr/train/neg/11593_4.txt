I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I can not remember anything, 20 minutes after the end of the movie, it even bores me to write a review. <br /> <br /> Okay, the # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add suspense and fears. Because of this nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither funny nor scary. What we get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy kills Lisa's friends using the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) but that's not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (perhaps because there is none) and you can not help wondering what the filmmakers were aiming for. The screenplay had to have more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film was very old-fashioned in itself (I want to say that I do not like cheese, even if I'm from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as in part 4 for example. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to rent / buy this movie if it is not complete, it's a real mess. <br /> <br /> My note: 4/10 (get used to it, the n Â° 6 is also a mess ...)
