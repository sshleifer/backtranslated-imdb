About the worst film in the distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I saw it in the media used, so I thought why not? Oh god a shame for zombie movies and fans of the genre! Anyone who has shot this movie must put away their camcorder and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds who have devoted time and effort to their films and they have something that this film does not respect. I know what it takes to make films, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent on making Meat Market, but none of that money or time was spent on his sucess. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in books on making independent films. I do not know how you released a DVD, but whoever did it is either a very good friend or banging your head against the wall. In gore movies, it's the quality and not the quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that it really happened in the shops and I could not get my money back. Please, if you saw this movie, write here and end the shlock. I know I'm very hard, I only had 10 lines so I try to get straight to the point.
