I can not believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved in this junk! The screenplay is so poorly written and the staging so low (both of the same person) that it's hard to find more one-dimensional characters in a movie. The dialogues are so lame that this so-called thriller has made laugh the few fools who have entered the theater. The configuration is tricky, inviting you to believe that you are going to watch a paralyzing thriller and suddenly, this is the most stupid persecution movie. Bassinger's character is so stupid that she actually stops shouting to God "Where are you!" so that the people who follow it can follow and flee! And then, apparently, she went into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs everywhere and the killers never lose sight of her, and this happens in the middle of the night. I really wonder if the best Hollywood writers can see that they are spending millions to produce it.
