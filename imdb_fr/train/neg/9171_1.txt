What can I say? I ignored the critics and went to see him myself. Damn the reviews were so good. What a waste of money given his budget. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing, I went to see Kill Bill after this one. <br /> <br /> Seeing a really scary movie would be a turning point. <br /> Result - I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this shit.
