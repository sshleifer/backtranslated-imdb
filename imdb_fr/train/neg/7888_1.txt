I did not know anything about the film or the fact that it was based on a bestseller. Tried to guess what it was, a buried treasure and a list of dead. It lasted about 15 minutes I will not bore you with the seriousness of the plot and acting, but anyone who assigns him more than two stars must work for the filmmakers. He had his clothes, his shirt and his tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and / shirt. He could not even ensure continuity. I had the Christian theme, hard to miss.
