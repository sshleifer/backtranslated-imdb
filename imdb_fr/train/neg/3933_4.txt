If the Australian public gets a lot of them, it can still be funny today, but its excessive political error and brutal and subtle humor can make a wink. It lasts too long; Part of <br /> <br /> content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds Own, who desperately needed new stuff anyway. Admittedly, his Australian attitude is funny, but it becomes as annoying as the film crawls. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best songs, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? The adventures of Barry McKenzie will remain a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that foreign audiences do not see the majority of Australians like Barry McKenzies (or by the way Mick Dundees! ). Rating: 5/10
