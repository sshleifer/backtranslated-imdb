I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brains and wit, without forgetting the face, the pectorals and all the rest. Since I saw her in "Thelma and Louise", a thought worries me, to whom does he remind me? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious of course. Man, American, etc. but Brigitte Bardot comes to me anyway. He is so handsome that he is the most effective when he plays against. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "" Snatch "His humor makes him obsolete makes him human, almost accessible Fortunately" Troy "will soon be forgotten Only photographs of semi-naked Pitt in exquisite sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great movies of the second half of the twentieth century What does Wolfgang Petersen head for? Well, I guess that it would be very difficult to refuse to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
