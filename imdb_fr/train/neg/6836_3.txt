Please, even if you are in the worst of moods, refrain from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film had a positive result. On the recommendation of a friend, I watched this and literally emptied 1h and 48 minutes of my life in the closet. Bad acting, stupid direction, low scenario and pathetic action sequences - and when you mix that, you get "Double Impact". Even the least of the expectations have not been met. <br /> <br /> I guess I learned one thing: never watch Van Damme's action movies. They are pure waste of time!
