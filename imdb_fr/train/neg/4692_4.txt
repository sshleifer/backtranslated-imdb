When I first saw this film, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a double feature film. Glenn Ford, weapons expert, is called to defuse a bomb hidden on a train loaded with powerful explosives. The voltage is slow and constant. and this black and white film lasts about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; Tension and drama have lost most of their impact. It's still a good movie about the standards of the early 50's. <br /> <br /> Alongside Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
