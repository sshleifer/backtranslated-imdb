After seeing the 2004 Canadian / Icelandic / British production "Beowulf & Grendel", which I considered brilliant and breathtaking, I tackled the first of three new films from Beowulf to be released this year, with concern. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I moaned. They were Swedes and Danes from the era of migration, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (the horns allow your enemy to easily break your helmet and break your head). Then there is the Hrolfgar Palace, which looks like a backdrop for a film about Greece or Rome, not about 6th century Denmark. Swords and armor resemble the props left by earlier films taking place at different periods of history. I spotted weapons that could have been used by the Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven", and a character even brandished a Windlass Steelcrafts replica sword from "Beowulf & Grendel"! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was lugubrious and the game totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow with an aiming system and explosive projectiles that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special effects monster and his mother used so many steroids that Beowulf could never have torn an arm, as he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods for their bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I will not do it.
