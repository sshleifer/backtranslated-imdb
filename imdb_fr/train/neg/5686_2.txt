Hello. This is my first review for any movie I've seen. I had the trouble to do this to tell everyone that it was literally, the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I feel that the film was done in a neat way, which I will understand a bit because of budget constraints. I felt as if I was watching a very bad remake of the film seen. What I agree, I see it too, is also very graphic, but I liked the film. <br /> <br /> The scene where he takes the hammer to the victim's head tied up in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well actually, it was probably around 5 min but still. I want to note that I like some horror movies and I give them credit if they are good. This director, Uwe Boll, and his group of people who used to make this film should think before making another film similar to this one. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY ANIMAL DEATH OBSERVER OF BEATIN, IN LETTING ROT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALSO AND A FIVE MINUTES OF SCENE OF SOMEONE WHO WILL ARRIVE THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER, then you will enjoy this movie if not, and you like, opt for a higher budget movie, as seen for example. I can not believe that people make movies like this. Anyway, sorry for all those who love Uwe Boll and took it to heart, it's just my opinion of the film.
