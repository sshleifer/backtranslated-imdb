Apparently, Hollywood only distributes money to anyone who owns a camera and can talk. This movie was terribly bad. The cast was terrible, the acting indescribable actor and the story full of holes. Scenario? who needs scripting? I was surprised that the movie was not as vulgarly verbal as I thought, but I had enough pictures of T & A to last all my life. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so badly scripted, I thought that the two brothers of the film were first lovers. The scenes on the tour, as well as the main actor of the movie, make me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. It's this kind of movie that Grindhouse was inspired by himself ... Only the writers thought they were serious.
