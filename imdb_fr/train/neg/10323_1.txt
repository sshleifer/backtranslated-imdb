I was excited to see a sitcom that would represent, hopefully, the Indian Candians, but I found that this show was not funny at all. Producers and actors are probably happy to receive both good and bad feedback, because for them, we talk about it! I was ready for some stereotypes and I have no problem with that because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there was really nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. The father "fresh from the boat", who does not understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim girl (who is also a terrible actress) and the young modern Indian who tries to manage his mosque as politically as possible (he is a very good actor, I see it only improve). <BR /> <br /> It is very artificial and the dialogue does not flow very well. There was so much potential for something like that but unfortunately I think it failed, and I do not really care to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, she is always a treat and a natural to everything she does, too bad that her daughter in the series has not the same acting skills!
