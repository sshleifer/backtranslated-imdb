I am clearly at a disadvantage here. I did not see the first two films in this series, although I often saw Larry Cohen. The fans of the show seem to think it's a good movie. Judging by itself, it was rather boring. <br /> <br /> You never really see the face of the manic policeman (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was rather dark. The scenes of death seem to be staged to engulf the most movies, not to give thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cup, I might be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end with the car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was rather intense. best part of the movie.
