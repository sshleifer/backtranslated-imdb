I do not know how this movie has received so many positive reviews on this site! I am a big fan of Vonnegut and I know very well the story of this original Showtime film, built beyond belief, but even if I was not, the mediocre cast, the VERY mediocre cast (Sean Astin as brilliant, sporty and individual, Harrison? The type is generic!) And writing below the standards made this tripe barely visible. Someone pointed out how cute this line of Maculay Culkin was. If you read this and think it's pure comic brilliance (unfortunately, it was probably the funniest part of the movie), you may like this movie. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or you're not completely crazy, do not see it. Please.
