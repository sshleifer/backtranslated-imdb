Many deaths occur in the wild. You do not have to be a scientist to understand that! But does it have to be at the center of a documentary on nature? What is there with this fascination for death macabre? Do we really have to see an adult elephant shredded by a group of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah seizing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought it would be a family-friendly nature movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the terrible violence in the trailers of the film? Were filmmakers afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> Then we see the beautiful birds of paradise perform a mating ritual according to the most boring and stupid story possible. It was surreal! It's as if filmmakers thought they were only talking to a room full of first- and second-year students on a field trip! Wow! From mediocre to feeble in a heartbeat! <br /> <br /> If there are future documentary filmmakers on nature who are waiting behind the scenes to read this film review, why not focus on: animals copulating; to give birth; lay eggs; bathing; sleeping; to clean each other; socialize; playing; emotional manifestations other than fear and anger; unusual behavior, such as the mouth that is smoldering; migration; talent for problem solving culture (yes, many animal species have what man calls culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or destroying beauty, and why not be much more balanced - and focus on fun and inspiration?
