This film is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is awful. Paul Rudd is the only one to have talent and the only one not to annoy. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is in this series, but in this film she was horrible. It's as if she knew nothing about acting. Her character only moans throughout the film, and she can not become a b **** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you're looking at the memory cards as you read them. <br /> <br /> As for history, it's a cookie cutter. It goes from point A to point B without much surprise. Much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved around her and the things she does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.
