I saw it a few months ago on Family Channel and, having some memories of the TV show of my youth, I decided to watch it with my 4 year old daughter. I should have had psychedelic mushrooms to accompany him, because it's weird! Not only is it a musical comedy with annoying and forgettable melodies, the effects of cheese required and the cameos by stars far beyond their strengths, but it seems to have been produced as the good trip of somebody. a. Flutes that speak, British children way too old for that kind of shit ... to use the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuuugggghhhh! What was I on?" If you are a big fan of all the work of Sid and Marty Krofft, go for it! otherwise, unless you want to loop before watching, stay far, far, far.
