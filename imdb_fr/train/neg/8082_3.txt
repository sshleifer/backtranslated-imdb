It was one of those late nights "it's there" I saw things. Sometimes they are great. This one was awful, but it really should not have been. <br /> <br /> The film had a very good distribution. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We are talking about an Oscar winner here. There were good special effects. There were even very good tits! And I mean well shown, full breast with full nipple and at one point even a beaver. But that did not make up for the one missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean that the "solar crisis" blew the sun, but it was bad enough. That was the rest of the stuff - the so-so-stupid and totally predictable stuff of society. Man who does not resist! No amount of spaceships or nice or good fight scenes could get around it. <br /> <br /> I've seen the same cast members be incredibly good. I've seen wonderful sci-fi movies with casts and tiny budgets. The difference is in writing.
