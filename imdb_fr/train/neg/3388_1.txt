I admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. I have never seen the movie until very recently on the cable and I watched it in anticipation, to see my memories come alive, because I loved the original show. Imagine my dismay. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst translation of a Broadway show to do. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I was expecting a trip to the past, singing extraordinarily touching songs, Music and Mirror, In Ballet and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Do not! Not only did they falsify the music to an almost unrecognizable level, but they messed up the script by adding songs and outside intrigue (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) missing from the original and injecting "drama" where this was not necessary. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you're a fan of the original Broadway show, do not worry. I'm sorry I lost my time and diluted my memories by watching this tripe.
