Considering that John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I was expecting his pilot to be very interesting. However, I probably had high expectations because I was quite disappointed. First, they turned the protagonist into a monster who had the crazy idea to show his incredible knowledge in front of an audience, in a public space. So after this scene, I started to worry that it's just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse because none of the other characters were introduced correctly. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less intriguing. Dominic Purcell's performance disappointed me a little because I found out that he did not manage to make John Doe a credible man. The history of the police is another problem. It was really like an impression of déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. This brings us to the group's worst problem, the episodic format. I could already see the loads coming one after the other. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disappointed and I do not recommend it to anyone. Seeing how bad it was, I understand better now why the series was canceled. In a way, I feel he missed his target, developing characters to help the protagonist to find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The quality of the production was also pretty good and the casting correct. But I will never know if it has improved, probably not, because I do not intend to watch the next episode.
