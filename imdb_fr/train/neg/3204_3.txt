Although not as bad as what was done to be (I saw MUCH worse), it's still a very lame movie. In summary, a reissue of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the set of Joe Don Baker, an unattractive actor if he is one. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini It's great (and very funny) as a villain, a kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. It is the main reason to sit through this steampile, while the rest of the cast plays the most terrible role, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe that he was once a romantic actor (look at "Mondo Cane" to see him fleeing women). Looking here as a second-rate Ben Gazzara, he has almost nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all this corresponds to a generic 80s action movie that could not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can do good B-Movies, but here he stumbles, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least, the locations in Malta were nice and Venantini is trying to save the situation. 3/10.
