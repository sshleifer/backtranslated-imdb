No revelations here, but I have been a fan since the beginning of Waking the Dead, but the last series, of which only 3 have been shown so far, is awful. The stories are nothing like the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last drastic jaw series. As a BBC license payer, I called after the series the BBC's complaints to convey my disappointment. I am surprised that actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not oppose the scenarios. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, they can see that it's lost. It's a good job, it's the last series or the next series could start with the investigation into the death of Santa Claus! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
