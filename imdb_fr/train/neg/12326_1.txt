A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all about a stupid plot or something like that. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sexual comedies of all time. Does anyone realize that this film sheds light on the molestation of children? I guess it's okay because he's a teenager - if we had one with a man who was seducing a teenager, he would (rightly) be indignant. Sorry, but doing it to a boy does not excuse him. It's always sick. I realize that Brown was older (he was actually 18 when it was done), but he looks at 15. I find it disturbing that some people find this work acceptable. (but I can not play, Brown is easily one of the worst kids actors I've ever seen) and constant nudity gets boring and is not even very erotic. <br /> <br /> a theater in 1981. I was 19 years old and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily turn 18). He wanted to see it - I did not do it but I decided What on earth? We arrived and bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously underage. My cousin's thought was boring and the other three kids left half way! Let's be clear: three young boys have left a film filled with female nudity! This should give you an idea of ​​the seriousness of the situation. I am surprised that this has ever been published. A 1 all the way.
