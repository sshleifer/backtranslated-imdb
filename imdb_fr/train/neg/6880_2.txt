I was excited about someone making a documentary about Puerto Rican life. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I wondered if she could know what it's really like to be Puerto Rican. As far as I know ... she was a Nuyorican. Anyway, I sat anxiously with my popcorn to watch. I realized in 10 minutes that my initial apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of what it means to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is rather a first-hand account, very very personal, about what it means to be a Nuyorican ... and all that implies. She (like most Nuyoricians I know) has a diluted sense of history, partial and sometimes twisted. (How could they not ... they live here.) Yes, they are all proud. As they should be! But many do not know the ins and outs of culture, history and the political context or the REAL language for the most part. All this became very apparent with his participation in the Vieques question. No matter what my personal opinion is, it's about this question ... at least I know what the fight is all about. She happens to be arrested for something she did not know much about ... and in which she was involved because it was a "Puerto Rican cause". I really do not understand why she is not embarrassed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Ricans, consider this a partial account of the journey of discovery and acceptance of women. Do not take it as a gospel ... a lot of it is not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress. not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for the other Nuyoricians, the basis of their information. Instead, just step forward to find more information, learn and debate the reality. Not just the one coming out of this woman's eyes.
