The film is actually too slow. There are some beautiful pictures but that can not prevail over the fact that the movie is boring. You see sexual intercourse like a lot of watermelons and sexual intercourse by eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may even sound interesting to someone, but trust me, watching it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh a few times, but it's really not enough and maybe it's more out of despair and disbelief than amusement. To bother the director of boredom, he tries to place some video clips in the movie. These are very colorful clips of nonsensical songs from the 50's, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be so funny that it's really sad. Many times you have the impression that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is created but that it eventually evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips, there is virtually no dialogue, let alone music. The director tries at all costs to be original and artistic. Personally, I can not recommend the movie. I think art is something that should not be boring. During the screening, all the cinema was yawning, which corroborates my purpose.
