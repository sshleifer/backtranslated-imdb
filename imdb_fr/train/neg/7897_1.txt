This movie was designed for those who found Gremlins too serious and Critters too hardcore. Like many 80s creature / troll / gremlins movies, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no limit to this comment. It's just bad and not fun. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie about a miniature monster is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up having the same success as Howie Mandell in Walk Like A Man. What made horror films from the 80s classics is that they were sincerely trying to scare, but they were hilarious because they failed so miserably. Someone had to tell Bettina Hirsch (yes, THE Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for comedy before starting to make this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, seeing a strange little cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trench coat and throwing billiard balls at a Lost Lost pariah is fun, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> By far the most boring part of the movie is Paul's character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start moving fast from the beginning to the end of the credits, stopping only once to see a scene where a munchie throws billiard balls at a guy ... For let the final result be calculated, do not walk, go to your nearest blockbuster, give him your hand and thank him for not having the grapes to store this pile of garbage on the shelves.
