At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity. For a good reason! The hound has left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no acute analysis of signs at the scene of the crime. Holmes rolls fifty meters behind the plot. The damn CAM is finally treated by a frail old man, in a way that would have swelled Charles Bronson's heart with six bullets in the bread basket. do not decide to nail the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, escape savagely. Well, it's a bit of a change of pace at the end of Victorian history in London. A little law of six shots :-)
