This so-called prequel is just a poorly made remake of a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The parcels are identical to those of most scripts. I loved the original book and the first movie, but I will not bother with the third movie. The useless joke between the two main characters in the pre-sequence was totally predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can not emphasize how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word for it, look at it and you will see what I mean. If you've read a review that says "If you like the first one, you'll like the second one", it's only because it's THE SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even so good. They took so many lines from the first movie that it's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
