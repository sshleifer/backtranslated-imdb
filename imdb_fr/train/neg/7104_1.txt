The producers of this film propose to pay the funeral expenses to anyone who dies of fright watching this film. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy to anyone who really appreciated the smell. A young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the couple's wife lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, I did not care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs.
