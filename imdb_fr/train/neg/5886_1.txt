I would have left the film halfway if I had not been with people who liked it. The film is based on actual incidents, but it is so out of proportion that it does not feel at all real. I have a psychological background, I live with a lot of psychotherapists and I know crazy people. So it's not that I think people like this do not exist. But in the film, the only characters that always seemed human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a sense of naughty fun). There were some fun moments, but the overall tone of the movie was dark, weird and mean. What a waste of an exceptional cast! Watching them pass their turn, I felt like I was watching a drama class. This was reported at home during the credits, when two people were shown sitting, not doing the act, not speaking. These few moments were more entertaining than the previous two hours.
