Still another British romantic comedy to which the public of the whole world seems to have a ravenous appetite. This feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√© scenes here are ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to run after the departure of the trains to declare his love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, with the exception of Love-Hewitt which manages to give some cohesion to the film. Things may become out of control in the plausibility department as the movie progresses. our suspension of benevolent belief eventually collapses during the absurd end. If you are looking for an experience from Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, you will not find it here.
