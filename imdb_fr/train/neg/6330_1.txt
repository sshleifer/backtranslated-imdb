If you like the SNL cast and original shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When this movie was released for the first time, my friends and I queued for over an hour to enter an exhausted movie theater. in the middle of the film, the theater was three-quarters empty. We refused to leave thinking that it would be better. At the end of the film, we were the only ones left at the theater. The film only lasted one day in all the theaters, then disappeared from view. In interviews with "Mr. Mike", he declined to comment on this film. The movie was an inside joke about the SNL episodes that came out just after the release and closing of the movie in one day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and mail for a refund, but we were totally ignored.
