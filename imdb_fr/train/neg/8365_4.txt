It's a simple tale but it seems very manipulative. It lacks pathos because it leaves no room for imagination, personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done but I feel that it is too much presentation. I would have preferred more pictures from behind, more space in the background and maybe it would not seem so kitschy. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie, it works well but it's very derivative of Aardman movies and it bothers me. Maybe a longer film will check if this manufacturer can do without the voiceover. <br /> <br /> I think the voiceover is too flippant.
