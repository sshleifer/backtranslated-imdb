This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it during an event called "fantafestival". I find it appalling because some scenes look like chaotic and dark musical clips, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and no movie. The music is completely out of the story and I do not have words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later, it gets busy. The story is interesting but the development needs a comprehensive review.
