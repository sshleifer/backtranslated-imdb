This film disgusted me so much that I felt obliged to warn others. This film has no story, plot or purpose. The film begins after the standard intro of the film "leaves scary", to which each movie observer is accustomed. We can completely ignore the beginning. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from that moment on, it becomes obvious to you that you have just wasted your hard earned and that it would be better to look at static images. (Except if you've seen white noise - EEK) To act is a shame and all must return to the traveling pantomime from which they came. That said, even the best actors in the world would struggle to ensure that this film can be watched from a distance. Their poor performance only contributes to the disaster. The insane violence and what I can only assume is the written word of another "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, has given rise to a film that will test your patience. Only when my fellow observer turned to me and said, "We have been watching this for 45 minutes". I realized that this film was as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly, something was missing and unfortunately it was not the public. Rather than suggesting what is missing from the film, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, bad-monster-thing, about 2 minutes of scenario that stretches out hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a good side of things? Well, the blonde girl is a bit crazy looking at some scenes, but expect to want to see her face get scammed for the rest of the movie!
