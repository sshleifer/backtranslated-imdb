This movie starts slowly, then fades. After watching for about an hour and seeing that nothing was happening absolutely, I went out. I mean, nothing has happened. Zero. Zip *: French. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people we all know. The producers of this film could be sued in court if they tried to sell it as a "motion". There is no movement. I could have told the same "story" with some still images with captions. The script is a joke. It's just horrible. I doubt that a doctor's script in the world can save him. My biggest regret is not having lost 60 minutes of my life watching "Love In The Time of Money", but having missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to go out, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people go out before me.
