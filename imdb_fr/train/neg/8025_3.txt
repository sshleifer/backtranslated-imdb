Yes, even as a fan of shows like the survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. The first two shows did not bother me, but then I realized how pathetic it was to go to the show in the first place. The antics of Alex and Aaron who gave a bad reputation to the men by deceiving them or abandoning their choice at the first occasion, the show was really not beautiful. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on TV and she was certainly not the smartest girl yet (very media savvy, but I doubt there are many more). <br /> <br /> really watched none of the shows since, apart from the occasional rebroadcast on daytime television. I think the purpose of reality TV is to treat it as an "entertaining trash". Think of it as something you can laugh at, and not think too much (I do not look at CSI, it's like reality TV, tired and cliche, but you have to think too much when you look at it). <Br /> <br /> Some thoughts on some reasons for the show. At the very beginning, "the woman said it all", a woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene, in bars and clubs, to meet a guy and that it did not happen for her. Hey Amy, why do not you go to a club, have a hobby, do a charity job, change your job to another one where you meet more guys? All I know is that going to a bar is not the place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting the "perfect man". Ladies' index: it does not exist. However, there are a lot of great guys who would make great husbands, some of whom might suit you! they may not earn six digits a year or look like JFK junior, but they're still great guys. The superficiality of the woman on this show is quite incredible. I am still a young man, to believe that the woman has gradually grown in depth as she grew older and became more realistic about her future partner. This show proves the opposite. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show confirms many stereotypes about how women perceive men in society. It's really a terrible show and I think all these types of shows should stop being produced. The best dating shows per country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel as they are fun. Between "couples", nothing is more skillful than a simple night. the single person, unfortunately, takes himself too seriously.
