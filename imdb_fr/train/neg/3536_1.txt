I do not think I've ever felt so disappointed by a movie. After having liked Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I do not count Swept Away - he was blind to the kitty), I was so eager to see that. <br /> <br /> Critics were mediocre, but I do not trust the press anyway. What was even more disturbing was that the buzz on the Internet was that it was a little fishy, ​​so it was with some trepidation that I gave my £ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not even try. explain this film, mainly because I have no idea what was going on and at some point I was about to get up and ask if it was just me who did not did not understand! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into the trap of taking himself too seriously.It seems like it's not good enough for him to make movies with good plot, laughter, dialogues characters. It's almost as if he had a list of movies he wanted to scam. Here are some that I noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Bill Kill, The Suspect Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the story and indulgent editing / direction that has filming down. <br /> <br /> This is a big congratulation from me.
