Despite the remarkable work of supporting actors and the intelligent scenario of Alan Plater, this film suffers from a serious flaw: the lack of charm of the character / central actor. One of the characters describes Richard E. Grant's character as "a shrieking little shit" and, unfortunately, it sums it up perfectly. Nothing in him or his performance suggests that his girlfriend and the publisher / friend of the upper class would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and completely annoying. The party called an actor who can make you love even when he is a prate - an Ewan McGregor, for example. <br /> <br /> All spiritual satire about the class system, etc. this irritating performance and deeply incomparable. All I wanted was to shake him up and tell him to recover from himself.
