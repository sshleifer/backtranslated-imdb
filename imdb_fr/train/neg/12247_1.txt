This movie is really terrible. terrible because in this are a loss of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are terrible. The acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> This is a crocodile attacking a tourist view filming a documentary on the "surf blood". We surf the blood when they surf around sharks, but it goes wrong when a 31-foot crocodile interrupts his vacation. Sharks do not seem real. The crocodile is even worse and it becomes even more pathetic when they escape from the creature, but the crocodile remains blocked and 2 females illuminate it. The dead are wrong and the pirates are only there to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A useless and terrible movie that is not worth seeing!
