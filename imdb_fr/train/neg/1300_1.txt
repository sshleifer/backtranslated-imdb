This film should never have been done. Honestly, I must admit that before seeing him, I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she has shot a lot of movies in Holland and the young woman in the lead role is a television personality with a constant smile and a lack of self-criticism. The actor who played the other main role I saw recently in Bride Flight and although this movie is better, he did not convince me that. To begin the story, I have not read the novel on which it is based, but the script behind the film is something that could have been done for children to have a birthday party on a Sunday after Rainy afternoon, not someone of the same age. same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing was the overlapping dialogues, it was mostly spoken aloud. My greetings go to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something. Too bad the film was ugly mounted, otherwise some scenes were certainly more credible.
