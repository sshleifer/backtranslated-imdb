Well, this movie certainly had a lot of hype; From the excitement of the Toronto Film Festival to the acclaimed critics of CBC Radio. An independent film refreshing, crazy and hilarious apparently. I had been waiting for it for months now. <br /> <br /> How can I just say it? It was really bad. An exercise in cinematic lameness that gives Adam Sandler the appearance of a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was slightly fun and, at worst, caused a coma. An American script often misdirected and poorly edited in a failed mess. <br /> <br /> And what made the music 500db stronger than the rest of the soundtrack? It was pretty much the only thing weird about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny and weird movie featuring aliens, then try Repoman. There is no comparison!
