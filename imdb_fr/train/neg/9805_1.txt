I never really understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show, which was simply a second-rate Americanized version of the ultra-popular super sensai series in Japan for the last three decades! What was cool in the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, the characterization, the special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that the Power Rangers are the best but they would be incorrect. <Br/> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much better the American version of Super Sentai is. <br /> <br /> The Power Rangers are completely awful, try the Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
