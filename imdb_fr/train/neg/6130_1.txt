In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, the men in this position are offered movie roles that exist solely to take advantage of that. I have no idea what Thomas was paid for making this film, but I would have to pay a lot of money to accept making a fool of myself in a movie. The film is obviously derived from "Enter The Dragon", as are most martial arts images. Only instead of a true martial art, they concoct a new absurd martial art, accurately described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dance". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue a lady from an impenetrable fortress, but each piece has an accessory that is exactly what Thomas needs to send back the wicked assistants. Of course, he makes his way to the main villain, and of course, they have a fantasy fight, with an end that will only surprise those who have never seen a martial arts movie. There are touches that nostalgic guys will love, especially Thomas's haircuts and many male co-stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you want it to Kurt Thomas, who would have liked never to have set foot on the set.
