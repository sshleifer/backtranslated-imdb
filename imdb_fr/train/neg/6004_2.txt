The best thing about camp movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match, a one-day soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the skinny plot, identify the cardboard characters and watch with satisfaction as all shots are made. However, sometimes the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. Director Makinen is one of the best camp directors and his best film. <br /> <br /> At Yon Saalistajat, everything seems to be going well. There is nothing good about it, but still manages to be a coherent whole. Not once, the film does not slow down: the action continues and the blows continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while others spend an hour in a bar. This is partly because of the Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so the day does not turn into night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a plot there, somewhere. You may need to watch the movie three times before you know it.
