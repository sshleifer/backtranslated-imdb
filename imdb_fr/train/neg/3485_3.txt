This film was pretty absurd. There were some fun parties. In my memory, it comes right to me in the basket of movies where I think: "Hmm ..... this movie had some fun parts, but overall, a pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)." <br /> <br /> I thought Ben seemed to be trying a little too hard to be a funny and funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a self-taught multimillionaire and such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. It's bullshit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was entirely his fault, I like him overall. I guess it looks a bit like the child for whom you feel sorry because he just seems unable to understand. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this movie. It did not really turn into a viable plot and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. All in all, this movie is NOT a movie at home, it's NOT a Christmas story, nor its Christmas holidays, nor any of the other classics. Forever unforgettable.
