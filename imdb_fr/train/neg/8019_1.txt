I have read half a dozen other user reviews on this forum and it seems that opinions vary greatly. I agree with those who found this film horrible. It hurts me to write that since I would have hoped it would have been great, otherwise I would not have bothered to see it the other day. I like supporting independent cinema, especially if they are gay, but this movie is almost too hard to tolerate. Those who came out, as I envisioned after about three minutes, are probably not afraid to spend $ 11.00, or simply realized that they were not going anywhere, quickly and that they were not would not improve. Maybe I'm slightly more optimistic than they are ... or they did not pay to go in first. <br /> <br /> Logan gets bored. It's a klutz. He's gay. I agree with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored, it does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring too! There are endless scenes of this kid hanging out like a load of clothes, restoring everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc. ... nothing or nobody is going anywhere. Nobody says anything, even insightful, funny or interesting distance. The most appalling of all is probably that I did not feel the slightest empathy for Logan. This in itself is a major achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he did not do anything, and neither did the film! Scene after scene, the same thing is not a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title does not make sense. 1/10.
