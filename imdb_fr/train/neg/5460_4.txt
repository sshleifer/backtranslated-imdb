Curiously, season 6 of the Columbo series contains only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scenarios, based on this release for "the man in the mac" and also "Fade into Murder ". . <br /> <br /> In addition, it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote the two aforementioned scripts (he plays the role of the assassinated security guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rarely convincing and many performers seem totally uninterested in the subject. The story is rather weakly developed, with some long periods of boring conversation. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also followed by a colleague (similar to "Last Hi for Commodore") but the value of entertainment is minimal. To add to this, Celeste's characterization of Celeste, which aims to provide a comedy, causes more embarrassment than laughter. <br /> <br /> The scenario is reluctant to deal with the family's story and the murderer is doing enough to offer the case to Columbo. although there is never a credible discussion about the reasons for his crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what turns out to be, it's questionable, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment of the series. He questions a hairdresser and makes a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - Columbo's hair is so perfectly coiffed that he can not afford to pay the bill, and when he asks a jeweler, he continues to look in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment of a script that seems to have been tweaked in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For the finalists of Columbo only.
