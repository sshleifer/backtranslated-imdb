"Pandemonium" is a parody of a horror movie that is more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you that I love comedies. Especially parodies of comedy. "Airplane", the trilogy "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that imitate a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up there with these movies. Most of the scenes in this movie sat me in stunned silence because the movie was not so funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this movie aims to do. Decidedly, "Scream" had more laughs than this movie and it was more a horror movie. How strange is it? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
