Such a pretentious and lame attempt at hipness. Diabolical script and dialogue and really embarrassing game. Really the worst movie I have ever seen (at the movies). Nothing in my opinion prevents this film from being a total disaster. I saw him when he went out to a cinema in Brighton. People were coming out and there were more people chatting outside the toilet than in the auditorium! In the end, there was screaming and contempt for the lean crowd that remained, which was quite sad because the relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish. However, the movie was so bad that I really could not feel so friendly with them. Everyone has to leave somewhere and their son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt at "Tarantinism made in the UK". Five years have passed, but sometimes I still remember that sad night in the cinema! This is a movie without any redeeming features whatsoever! I gave him a 1 because 0 was not available. They should invent a "shameometer" for everyone involved in this film disaster. I know that some of them have evolved into better things. The good thing is that none of them could have gone lower.
