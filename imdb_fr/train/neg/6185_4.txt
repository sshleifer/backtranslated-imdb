My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who like to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploration, they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact on the hidden Columbus treasure that is brought to the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, the four dives down from the reef and big after a whole day of diving, they find nothing. A few days later, the two hired divers discovered that they were part of a murderous plot in which they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The film also tells the story of another person (the main character's brother) trying to tidy up his relationship with his girlfriend. I think this part of the story was a waste of time, it also included a very hot sex scene between the couple who, for me, was a total loss and that it was not necessary to show. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, the film has good underwater photographs and the colors get married well, which is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a suite only by name. None of the actors or original characters come back, he has a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
