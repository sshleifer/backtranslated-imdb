Justifications of what happened to his film in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunkards and receptionists rewritting scripts aside, let's take this film as it is offered, without any outside explanation. <br /> <br /> This film is awful. Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehearse what can serve as a plot, I will introduce some curious points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (out of 5) goes on a field trip for a history class in the middle of friggin 'nowhere in Ireland. These students can be Canadian or American, it's hard to say. The fact that it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than in Ireland is also evident. A student seems to know nothing of the story and is basically the "dumb jock" character of a number of 80s kick ass movies, except when he channels Randy from Scream. A character can be dubbed by Chris Klein. He has a girlfriend who is probably killed, but it's never really established if it's true. A character is sullen and withdrawn from his peers ... just ... cuz ... and then there is a blonde girl. Yay blonde. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or is younger than the rest of the cast, is called "sir" more than once. He is very sinister and wears a knit hat. Her cousin is a rough porn star with the worst Irish accent in my life and probably beyond. <br /> <br /> Picturesque Ireland is home to many Canadian forests, swampy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once in a lifetime. deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> Producers got a discount on false bowels volume. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Without my knowledge, terribly inbred monsters have access to new hunting knives. Maybe there is some kind of outdoor store nearby with a blind and deaf employee working on the register. <br /> <br /> Without my knowledge, if you stay in a group for about 600 years, the story leads us to believe that it happened, you end up being a little lumpy, yet incredibly spry and pretty strong. Genetics is a wonderful game of craps. <br /> <br /> There may not be more than one particular phenomenon in this film. There is reference to "them" and we see shadows, but only one strange type is ever seen. And when a weird guy in search is finally killed, apparently all danger has passed. I start from the initial hypothesis that no one thinks of equipping a second man in complete makeup, that's why they just used this one. Anyway on the screen, anyway. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that, apart from these brilliant new knives, consanguineous monsters have access to some chic leather clothing, because once Richard Grieco has cut his ties, there are some has new loans for the next sucker that is tied up ... which then escapes, because the chains leave you soft enough to undo them, which makes you wonder why not even bother to tie whatever. <br /> <br /> A corpse in a hut will be destroyed by the larvae after what I imagine was about 2 hours. This corpse also wears glasses, when no character wore them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears for no reason since the scene on the left, chatting for 2 minutes, disappears to the left of the stage. In the middle of a giant forest. This is not unusual, because Gary can also come out of nowhere, which is also known as "everything that exists on television" lands on the screen. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Jameson dies sadly and her clothes fade away as my hope that this film does not suck the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special nod to the character of "Breeder", the poor girl who has been used by monsters for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes . The poor girl who always has an eye shadow and emotes in front of the camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The end of this film was clearly nailed to the point by a drunk or a person with a fierce mind. disability that has been cultivated and encouraged by over-consumption of gasoline over the years. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it was not just crap I found on the movie network late at night, apparently, people have heard about and even followed this film through its production . How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.
