I saw this movie last weekend and it's stupid and stupid. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy into pajamas? The victims are scared of nothing and can not flee in front of an old man who moves slowly. They drop their torches and tremble instead of trying to repel it or, duh, to burn it. Quentin aka Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster aka Miss Canfield of Fire at Beaver Glory, unhappy in marriage. Wow, plot of love. The rest of the cast just follows the graves and waits for the cries to react and run to their rescue. The Egyptian girl is not bad, but does not lend much to the movie. Where is the mother? Really just a raging curse. That does not leave a torch to Universal Mummy's films in the least. Watch this film if you need sleep, because you will feel good.
