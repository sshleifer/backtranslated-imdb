Is this the "worst" episode of Star Trek TOS? Maybe, at least, my vote is in the last 5. I mean, this episode has absolutely no meaning. See something that drives you crazy? Leave me alone. This episode also has a different sensation, the music is exacerbated, almost forced to increase the feeling of distress, to the point that it is null. Give me Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings such as those of Triskelion or other than those of Medusin, they are very boring extraterrestrials to make an episode. McCoy manages to pronounce his famous phrase "He is dead, Jim". Spock puts on his protective glasses during the ambassador's transport, but Kirk does not. They cross this creepy "barrier" for the third time, I remember, boring. At least the next episodes of the third season will be "Specter Of The Gun", and "Day of The Dove" and more to follow, making Trek a decent show to look at in syndication where it would attract people like me to big fans. Personal observations, Trek liked to use the purple color, its kind of pinkish purple, as when they were in the hallway outside the compartment, the corridor which is normally gray is now purple. We never had a purple bridge, but it's interesting to see. I noticed it in several episodes. It's a light filter that works very well, but in this episode, the ships corridor is rather lame.
