The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I guess it's a horror comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I think I could get as much effect from what I dragged home. I wish I had something good to say about this film, but I'm afraid not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After a little thought, I have a good thing to say about this film: it's over.
