Ok, I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, like at 9 am on Cinemax, and I thought it would be award-winning. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the monster's mother only shows her true form at the end of the movie. I'm going "That's right, why does not she show it briefly earlier in the film." The plot being mother and son feast on the blood of young women. It would not be better if they simply continued, you know, a killing killing like a couple of young women each, then asking the sheriff or a cop to inquire and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters, save the young woman (s), and have 1 or 2 other people killed during the process? I think it would be much better like this. It also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Also, how does she feel at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said herself that she was too weak. What was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, never say, that actors play any movie, after all, they do their best. If there had not been good acting, I would have given this film a 1/10. 3/10.
