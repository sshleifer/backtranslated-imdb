How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina always seemed fit and attractive, but for some reason seems really scared. I can understand his fear. fearing that this stinker 3rd rate is somehow made public. Plus, I'm a fan of the friendly Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and fit for a man of his age. His play here is passable, but the script is so bad that it's hard to listen to even the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The film is a scam of Brando's classic biker film, The Wild Ones; A group of outlaw bikers is out of control in a small town hick. The bikers here look like a motley group and I certainly would not want them to go out with my sister. The acting is steep and wooden, and the plot is as old as the sand. Hellriders is a hell to watch!
