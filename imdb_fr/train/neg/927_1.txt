I mean really, how could Charles Band let the head of Full Moon let out a stinking bullet like DEMONICUS? I mean, this should never get the green light to start. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranus, except for a bad guy. Then the writer or director commits himself for a bad ending. It's true a bad ending, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes from a murderous cavern, then an image of Chimera comes alive, inexpensively, could I add and chase it. Then, as she goes home to the FUNHOUSE. A statue that was destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on it. I mean, that makes no sense. What Charles thought when he let this pile of vomiting go, with four different film companies who were desperate for movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANK TURKEY.
