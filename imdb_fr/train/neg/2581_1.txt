First of all, to dispel any personal feelings, let me start by saying that I hate the so-called comedies in which every character is written and played as so stupid that you hurt him if they all result from consanguinity. <BR/> <br /> Now, I'll say I saw the first three American Pie movies and although they were not the most incredible movies I've ever seen, they were all good (and true masterpieces compared to the three American films). Pie Presents "movies", I always feel obliged to ask what the heck did they think when they made this film? <br /> <br /> I also have some other questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought it was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> who approved the final script (and what did he smoke when he approved it)? > <br /> And finally why was it thought that he deserved to be distributed in theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on the current place of residence while he should have gone directly to the basket of Blockbuster or Wal Mart discounts? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with this movie that I can not make an exhaustive report of it, because it would exceed the maximum number of words allowed on this forum. <br /> <br /> The plot is generic, stupid and stupid, and the characters are as interesting as watching the painter The most important thing I can not miss in this film is the acting game. <br /> <br /> While most of the actors are talentless, they will not be forgotten and will probably be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> the one and only big name of this film is Eugene Levy who spends most of his time on the screen with that smirk on his face that says to the viewer "I know that c I do not lose my talent but hey, I get paid not to me worry. "He does not even try to make his jokes fun (he really deserves better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the other actors are horrible even though some of them have been in very good TV series, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian Wind series At My Back) plays an unbearable and irritable character (there are things he could teach to tropical skin diseases) that you almost want him to die of a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) drags off screen and wastes his talent by participating in this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next movie in this series will be just a soft core porn with a story to get around the MPAA and get a R rating, this movie comes out with a useless nudist vulgarity and sexual content harmless which would have earned him to be rated X (the jury of the rankings had to be drunk or take drugs at the time he evaluated this film). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven submitted A MPAA to the MPAA, A Nightmare On Elm Street, he was forced to cut twenty-five seconds off video (I think it was part of a death scene containing a silicone breast) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no choice but to do it otherwise the movie would not have been published, but this kind of unnecessarily offensive rubbish film can get the R rating today because everything is done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content, there is would have had a huge stink on the contents and that would have been the terrible X Note. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really bothers me is the writing, this movie is written to be played like the wet dream of a twelve-year-old boy with an extremely hyperactive sexual imagination it's quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass , almost all the situations of exposure supposed to move the corpse e during this film, the plot is so telegraphed that any intelligent televiewer can see it arrive for kilometers and the so-called characters are only stereotypes stereotypes of stereotypes , not to mention the often disgusting sexual references and constantly pointless scenes of deviant sexual behavior one has the impression that this movie was written by an incompetent freshman hack in a rent movie school scenario writing class moderate. <br /> <br /> It is high time to end this series before it becomes more stupid and rude and offensive, this pie is filled with potatoes.
