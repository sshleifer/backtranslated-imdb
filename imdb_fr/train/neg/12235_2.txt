If you want to know what kind of music Whites were listening to in 1974, this movie is for you. But you will also have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins (see my remarks on My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> An indulgent admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance after seeing her predecessor. But while as an adoptee was preparing to leave in search of my birth mother, My Girl 2 made me look at her mother's research theme. <br /> <br /> In other words, everything I liked about My Girl 2 This has nothing to do with My Girl 2, but about a character who asks, like so many adoptees, "who is my mother"? And if there are my mother's films in a troupe of actors, I'll make sure to make my own film. <br /> <br /> People are apathetic. Films should not be apathetic. My daughter 2 (like my daughter 1) is just ... apathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you are a complete sap reassured by a series of small troubles.
