Strange ... I like all filmmakers and black humor movies; but did not like that at all! It's awful, horrible and certainly not funny at all. Mercy can not do a whole movie script, disgust either. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; he could have been removed. It should have been in another shorter format, surely. Maybe I was expecting too much from the team - like saving the movie lol -. It is also full of clich√©s overused characters and situations ... I do not understand why people liked it ... "Poetry", "Hope"; Nope 'mom, did not see anything like it! ^^ In short, it's empty and raw, pitiful and hopeless. Oh damn this one ........
