1st watched 26/12/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Mystery of the murderous comedy in Corny with very few laughs. The film seems to be based on an earlier Italian film by the credits, but has been rewritten by two relatively popular American romantic comedy writers. But that of Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. The story tells the story of Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumble upon a stray dog ​​and hope to make a fortune in rewards after seeing an ad after seeing an ad in the newspaper for the return of the dachsund. In trying to make it, they see a hand which, according to them, exceeds the door of the lady's garage and which, in their opinion, is attached to the rest of the corpse of the woman supposed to give them the money. Instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth, they panic like runaways on places that expect to be accused of murder. The other characters in the film are already met on a train and hang out at a Monte Carlo play station doing various things to be part of the story. Other members of the cast include actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. Once the police have learned of the death, she begins to question the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their crazy lies to understand what really happened. None of the actors mentioned above can bring this film out of its mediocre state despite some fun moments mainly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. It's not a horrible movie, it's just not so good. There are a lot of average movies and it's just another one for the stack. Try, you may like, probably not.
