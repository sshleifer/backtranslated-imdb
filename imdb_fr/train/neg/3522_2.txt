If you like standard Sly movies that involve extreme action, incredible stunts (unbelievable does not have to be complementary here) and a delayed dialogue; you'll love this steaming pile of mountain goat manure. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his "fantastic" days to give way to smarter people and to make an action movie that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, the frame and the action (credible) would prevail. . I wish an action at least pretty close to reality so that you can imagine the fear and excitement that could arise from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects has ridiculously ridiculed at least one scene. Judge Dredd is only better because you know, in the theater, that you will see a comic strip turned into a movie. The character, the scenery and all the rest are without comparison with everything we could meet ourselves. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns a climbing guide into a rambo before he can say "yo, Adrian!
