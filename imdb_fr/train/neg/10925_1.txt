I'm debating whether I should even finish watching this "poppy" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the film set buried, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is the buried scenery, a monster with a wolf's head that breaks loose, an amulet and a band of bad actors attacked by the wolf masking anything. What I would have missed had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a buggy chase, some very bad C.G.I, incredibly stupid dialogues, some other worse C.G.I. Other than the original idea, this film has absolutely no quality. My mistake to keep watching. - MERK
