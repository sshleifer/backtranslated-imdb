Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a pirate ship cook who assumes the duties of captain after murdering the previous one. Although he witnessed the burial of a treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets becomes white. So, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with the ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) And help you open the treasure path. It's amazing how everyone could have financed this useless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as a director and, given Medak's talents in The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy and dimly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film as a convicted pirate captain. He is probably very grateful that young Frankenstein was released the same year he was filmed and canned, so he could keep that on his resume. Franciosa looks frisky like the handsome power behind Scratcher, but he and the salesman look rather desperate, even with Sellers' makeup and hair looking terrible. They had to know that this movie was bombing even though they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible discomfort: <br /> <br /> STONE: (about to be hanged) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won "t, I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the good jokes I find amazing that great part of Sellers' prolific material is still in the safes, but it was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone who speaks and launches in the US? United the British television program "A Show Called Fred", which has been well received, and which features Sellers, Milligan and is directed by the great Richard Lester?
