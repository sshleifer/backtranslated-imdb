urgh! 3 things a film needs: a good storyline, a good plot and a good cast. I watched this movie waiting for it to be hilarious and I was unfortunately disappointed when it was just terrible. I lost the will to live midway. The only thing that kept me from stabbing my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason I was watching her at first). She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance has not changed much since she was 13 years old. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with such a terrible material. I think Sandra Bernhard was the biggest mistake of the movie. she was completely trapped and I think she never really understood the character. <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 out of 10 - and that's only because of Rose.
