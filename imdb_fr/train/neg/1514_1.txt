I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend only wanted to see him thanks to Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel I lost my time and money telling my girlfriend that it was the last time to go see a movie just because some actor / actress is in . I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her place. As far as I'm concerned, as I was already paying, I wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope that something good would happen, but I did not hold my breath and, fortunately, I would have been victim of the film. likewise. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it is a black and black film. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are described as hard-core non-tradable criminals, and the bad guys among them were really very bad. Talk about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical phobia of the United States. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's game was good, but the blond girl who was supposed to replace him was at best bland. Totally unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a spectacular, sensational and sensational unreal turn. They are simply using sex offenders as an excuse for violent, low-cost killings, violence by self-defense groups, rape and torture - which seems almost gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking people in the movie - how far can you get down. <br /> <br /> I guess the movie will not be released in the US and will go directly to the DVD. That's where he should have stayed in other countries too, but since it's Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a B movie.
