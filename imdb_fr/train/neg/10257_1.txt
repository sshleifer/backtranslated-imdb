Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - strong actors of type b movies But this bad movie did not use any of them to their advantage, none of their characters even meeting on the screen (well that Christopher Lee can play in front of him in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations of the extraterrestrials in this film seem to change overnight. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he has provided them with the crucial part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides to destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (although they offer a place to the main character and his wife in society). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is dedicated to watching the man and woman drive, walk or sit or sit at a desk doing nothing. You almost wish they'd come out with the rest of the planet at the end, just to avenge us for bothering you to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really love Chris Lee or the low-budget science fiction of the '70s, I'll give it to this one. It falls into this narrow range of celluloid wasted between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
