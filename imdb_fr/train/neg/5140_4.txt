Demer Daves is a great western director and the "broken arrow" remains in everyone's memory. As far as melodrama goes, he should leave that to people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The scenario is so predictable that you will not be surprised once you watch such a lukewarm movie. Natalie Wood's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe she was black Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitating life" ) and Sinatra and Curtis have roles so stereotyped that they can not do anything with them: the poor officer, and the rich handsome and mean sergeant.Guess France is presented as a land of tolerance, where interracial unions are welcome At the time (around 1944), it was doubtful, it is always for people with narrow minds that can be found here and elsewhere. .
