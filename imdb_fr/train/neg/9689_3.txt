In a way, it looks like "The Wizard of Oz", with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. But it's supposed to be about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence, when it comes to seamstress dresses, Riveria shots, lots of big expensive cars, and moments of music and dance that suggest Vincente Minnelli during one of his days. Visible, but a remarkable example of desperate and dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions. (Was it the model of "Talented Mr. Ripley?" Does anyone have an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
