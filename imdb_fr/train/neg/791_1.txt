Imagine the scene where a group of writers sit around a table and say, "Let a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask if he is black, then go away". Other writers hysterically laugh until they are told to repeat it at each episode. More laughs. Now, if you think the place is funny and the show contains a lot of situations like this, you'll enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining, like watching the paint dry. Those who have written glowing reports on this show should either go out more or be forced to watch really funny TV comedies. Another example of humor in the show, a girl tries to avoid paying at the checkout of a supermarket trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally funny the first time, but why repeat it again and again in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples, but these could be treated as detractors, explaining why this comedy is just not funny.
