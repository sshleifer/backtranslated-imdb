This film is actually nothing more than a series of tense sequences certainly well designed, punctuated by an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. In reality, there is no character development or intrigue as such. There are only the most skeletal motivations for the characters to do something while they gravitate in the wrath of their fate. It's simply an excuse to show a scary ghost child (who seems to have mixed up some of the family cat in his ectoplasm) and his ghostly mother (with long black hair hanging from his face, much like "The Ring") two-dimensional excuses cut out of cardboard for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of junk food in the cinema; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you should live. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
