In appearance, a film that predicts future trends in British popular music, it is wrong on so many fronts that it is laughable. Tommy quickly? Honeycombs? The DOES movie includes a song by Spencer Davis, two from the Animals series, and a tour of the Beatles' live film making their live version of Twist and Shout (every 1:20). But all in all, a clumsy display of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
