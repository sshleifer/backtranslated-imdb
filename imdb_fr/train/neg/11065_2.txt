This movie had so much potential. Anyone who has followed Jeffrey's story knows there are so many details overlooked in this movie that it's ridiculous. The film devotes too much time and effort to Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his drinking. Where was the development of the character? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer is no exception. Where in the film does he speak of his teenage years when he started killing and mutilating small animals? Instead, we give a vertiginous series of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the murderer, but do not respond to the major point of Dahmer's development. Moreover, the reason why the country became so intrigued by this story is the details - the way he arranged the bodies in his apartment and the efforts and actions he took to accomplish that; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. I could go on, but to summarize, too late in the movie, focused on her sexuality and not enough gore - the good things you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer".
