--- what happened to these people little appreciable. Alan Arkin was, as usual, not very funny and just went through the role. The children are all in disorder. Mariesa Tomei would probably like that role never to have come to her. And what do Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno do in this very bad movie? If you like watching the losers sink into their dysfunction and try not to do any better, this is your movie. All the others, take a walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
