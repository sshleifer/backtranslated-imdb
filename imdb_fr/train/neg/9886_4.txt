This is Peter Falk's movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie was released; I was already a maven movie at the time. Of course, neither my parents nor I saw this movie at the time of its release, but I was in love with the font used for its commercials and the aura that it was a important film. Thirty-four years later, I finally saw the movie. I had never seen a film made by Cassavetes. It's a hack, all in all. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's passage in "Rain Man": technically on an equal footing, but entirely on a note. While Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> Gena's performance annoyed me all the way through - it seemed better suited to "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not entirely his fault: it's a basket from the first to the last scene. We never discover why ?? But the character of Falk seems real and is interpreted very well by Falk as a badly deficient man. <br /> <br /> Rave yourself at least an hour (an editor would have needed!), which would have been a striking portrait and not that of a woman. under the influence, but of a simple man, Cro-Magnon, who overcomes a woman who does not work and yet can not take care of her three children and long hours of work of her husband . <br /> <br /> I 'm rather remembering Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he had cut his own tendency to excesses - as he amply demonstrates with this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
