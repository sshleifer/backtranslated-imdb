I am not particularly impressed by this movie which has a dull music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank you, God, because I was falling asleep. I make excellent use of accelerated photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all it is. <br /> <br /> My preference goes to his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 to 87 minutes and the proof that a continuation can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi realized in 1988, of a duration of 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both.
