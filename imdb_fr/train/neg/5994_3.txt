OK..This movie could have been so good! All generations were exposed to the Thunderbirds and loved it. This film presents some of the characteristics that one could look for in a good movie Thunderbirds. The craft itself and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while remaining faithful to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was just fantastic because Lady P and Bill Paxton, although I did not think Jeff Tracey was such, was strong enough ... but then the adults were removed from the equation and we were asked to believe 8 years could drive machines of 200 tons. <br /> <br /> It was not so much the fact that the film was focused on children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard-earned money. On the film, Alan Tracey was so odious in the film and seemed to be as capable of flying machines as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20 years old. Seriously, these are very simple machines to use if this is the case. <br /> <br /> The film did not seem to know if he wanted to be serious or ridiculous. He tried to pay homage while doing satire and he usually fell flat on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
