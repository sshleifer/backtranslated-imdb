This film is like all other Dutch films, so if you like movies like turks fruit and dood blond kleine. so you could agree with this one (even though these two have better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts out pretty hard, but even that good scene ends up having nothing to do with the script. There is a lot of nudity (but the others and I have not found this attractive girl), the dialogue is laughable (as we did a lot to annoy other viewers), and some scenes are so random that it is more an involuntary comedy than something else (like a random scene in which an owl tears someone's eye ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only mentioned once in a sentence saying "did you hear what happened ... I was there"). the only reason I gave him a 2 is because some of the places they are in are pretty ... that's all. And the reason I saw this was because we went to the preview presentation (here in Holland we have a strange system for previews preview, you pay less for a ordinary movie and you do not know which movie All you know is that it's a new movie that has not been screened yet My advice is to stay away from this movie, if you really want to see a movie good dutch movie watch Temmink or zwartboek.
