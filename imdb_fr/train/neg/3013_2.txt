Beginning with its long plan of opening seemingly endless rows of workers at the assembly line in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. His captivating story assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and that Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there can be a link between the current Asian aspirations to industrialization and wealth and the earlier experiences of famine and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, an effort is made to present the photographs of Edward Burtynsky industrial waste is somehow "beautiful". Much of the film is a slideshow of these images. They are well produced, the size of a museum and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost all photos can be made beautiful if they are well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the spoken message of the film remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. Landscapes made, however, offer only a strange and bitter despair. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it has some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
