Café Lumière is a beautifully photographed nap. Not knowing the director's work, I know the filmmaker he would pay tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro. Although he does not even approach Ozu in his greatness, Hou has not communicated anything to the depth of his emotions and his concentration on meaning in a closed space. One of the things that is totally out of place is Ozu's attention to the character - we are not even "introduced" by Hou to his main character (a perfect blank page). There are no close or medium shots of his people. One of the supplements of the DVD offers interviews of the actors and indicates precisely what Hou does not do - a good look on their face. <br /> <br /> There was a great Bardem Spanish film called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing ever happens". It would be a much better title for this useless exercise. Throughout the film, clues are given to us about an obscure Taiwanese composer whose works we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, give nothing. Unless you are a train trainer, this movie has nothing to recommend.
