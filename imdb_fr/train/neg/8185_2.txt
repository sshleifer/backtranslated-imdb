Oh my. I decided to go to the movies with friends, eager to watch one of those sweet and relaxing Christmas movies, and I go out disgusted. The film failed. Complete stop. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, played his character and rolled horribly, with Vince Vaughn, who has always been one of my personal favorites. They are trying to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. A little bad, mixed with good, but everything went very badly. The first ten minutes were not that bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It did not improve, the rate stayed the same, there was NO character development and is certainly one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Do not look at him, whatever you do.
