Everyone does things they regret later. Things they would like to be able to attribute to drugs or foreign possession. Things that, although seemingly rational at the time, turn out to be later engraved invasions of suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people, he signs the ticket for the new Hummer, for others, he takes a homicidal hitchhiker, for still others, he sends their bank account information to millionaires third world mysteriously short of money. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> D / War: Dragon Wars In hindsight, I should have guessed how eco-friendly and completely recycled this movie would be thanks to its jerky and repetitive title. But with my voluntary suspension of unbelief intact and a naive faith from the pretty poster in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Unfortunately, by the time the old man in the lender explained the whole backstory, fifteen minutes after the beginning of the film, I had the sudden and weak revelation that stems from the knowledge of each element of the plot. of a film still invisible. And worse: I knew how bad each point was. <br /> <br /> Let's be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe how serious this is. the movie is really. <br /> <br /> As to know all the twists of the film, I was wrong. In the spirit of Godzilla's old films, whose scale is not worthy of filling it, there were additional sub-plots each time the main characters were threatened by the specter of a constructive dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was infested with close calls, miraculous leaks and concentrated deposits of misguided anxiety. <br /> <br /> This film is what would happen if you gave access to the production product of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers to the national defense budget. And a lot of alcohol. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain to you. <br /> <br /> Imagine you can get all the coolest decors of successful action movies of the last decade: Take first the army of amphibians that talk about Rasta in the first episode of Star Wars and remove their Prozac until they are ready to face the Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Then take approximations close to Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even call it Ethan as a "subtle" sign of the Mission Impossible franchise) and give them a lot of narrations to the film noir, so that nobody gets confused while trying to follow the depth of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally add a rude voice villain in a pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings revenge and two giant cobras, furious to see their scenes erased from the last edition of King Kong, and arrange them in an order of no particular order in the modern world. Los Angeles day. <br /> <br /> Now head to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. On your return, puree these ingredients until the slightest hint of originality is dissolved in a homogenized cheese mass and you know semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> Several times during this photo, I found myself saying aloud "Stop the bad movie" and cry. <br /> <br /> Call it a movie B, it would give him an undeserved promotion. After summer school and many physiotherapy sessions, you could upgrade to a C movie if you could sleep most of your time. <br /> <br /> In short, if you ever end up with money and brain cells to burn, and need to punish you for hideous and unmentionable sins against humanity, Dragon Wars might well to be the movie for you.
