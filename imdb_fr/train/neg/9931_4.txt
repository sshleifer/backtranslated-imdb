"Black Angel" is a minor thriller, with June Vincent in the role of a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he was convicted of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered wife) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has a thankless role as a suspect. This film noir looks like a cheap programmer, never realizing anything special. It's nice enough, but at some point it does not make any sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big reactions like "give me a break". This end alone could have completely cast the film, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a shabby heroine and Duryea has never been very good at playing good guys. I love black movies, but this one was a real disappointment.
