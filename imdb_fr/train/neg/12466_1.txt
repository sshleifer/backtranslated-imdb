I was looking forward to receiving the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a desappointment! This has become one of the most confusing films I have ever seen. There were so many characters introduced, some similar to others, that it became impossible to follow the plot. I did not understand how George Clooney had received an interpretive award for his film since he was barely involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might have considered a quick lead to see if the end was better but after so much confusion, the chances of improvement were slim. A colleague told me that many movies "come together" at the last minute or less. I was glad I did not miss an hour of waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
