This film poses a number of problems, but the bottom line is that he tried to do too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money just was not there to do justice to the story. The nonexistent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (screenwriter / director) has a writing credit for "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which was a box office success. However, this film had serious financial consequences from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when not to make a movie. Had it waited a few more years, technology would have made the effects less expensive. (Not to mention that he could have found a business with money.)
