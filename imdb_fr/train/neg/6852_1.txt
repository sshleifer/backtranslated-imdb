This movie is really amazing. I have seen so many cheap trash movies, especially "Full Moon", but "Dollman" is really hard. Everything is together: the laughable story, the actors always on the verge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! It's a very bad film, but also one of the funniest. If you like to laugh at bad movies, you have to see it. And do not miss "Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys ". It's really funnier and worse.
