This film is bad news and I am really surprised at the level of talent of big names who would never agree to play in such a bazaar as this one. I imagine there were some strangled agents on Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really brings you is that it could have been good. The filmmakers appealed and the subject was enough to generate interest and sell tickets, but it was a failure. The multiple stories go from bad to stupid at the end of the images and you end up feeling like a mouse in a labyrinth looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is to take revenge on all Italians who may have beaten him in childhood or insulted him, because the film shouts a lot by perpetuating Italian stereotypes outdated and probably offensive. As in all of Spike Lee's films, there are really magical and provoking images. He has the gift of grasping your psyche and transporting you in his vision, if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you stand the other 2 hours scratching your head and watch the clock as you wonder and wait for the end that has to be there somewhere.
