When I got this film for free from my work, with three other similar movies, I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad in itself. In for money. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. It's certainly not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for thrills, it's not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell, this is the kind of movie you would see very late at night on a local TV channel that just wants to take some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local TV station that is trying to take time. Despite the acting, the clich√© lines and the work under camera are mediocre. I did not have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend it had never been in my DVD player. The story has been made many times in many movies. This one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
