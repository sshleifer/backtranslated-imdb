What do you get when you mix a bunch of shots with a nonsense rhythm and a group of characters that you do not care about and a failed attempt to create an attractive visual style and an even bigger bunch of clich√©s and a poor sense of humor and a very big budget? Why, you get one of the most intolerably impossible movies to watch! I'm talking about Domino, of course. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people could say while watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the story is out of sequence, it was not made a billion times before, and much more skillfully than in this film. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and the texture of the granular and elaborate film The director strives to give an appearance artistic to the scene and create a visual style! It's just a pity that none of these effects adds anything to the movie or makes sense with the scenes they are in, and that's also a pity that most of them are irritating! "<br /> <br />" I have already heard this exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand films! "<br /> <br />" I saw this scene in about thirty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" This one too! "<br /> <br />" Uh, did not they reveal this "plot" half an hour ago, is that surprising? "<b r /> <br /> "If this movie is supposed to be showing a 'hard girl' who kicks ... when why does not she do it a lot? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how original this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long does this thing last? I have the impression to look at it for already more than four hours. "<br /> <br />" I do not know what has just happened, but I do not feel particularly motivated to try to understand it. "<br /> <br />" Is it finished? "<br /> <br />" I want to get my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs on this soundtrack are so badly used here. "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the curses they use hurt the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> And finally:" Maybe I should end my friendship with the person who recommended this film to me. "<br /> <br /> In summary, this film is a Failure in almost all aspects Avoid looking at all costs If your house is on fire and the film is being played in the only non-flammable room, seriously consider burning yourself. <br /> <br /> (Si I look bitter, it's because I just spent more than two hours watching this movie and, um, I did not like it much.)
