I just saw this movie and I must say that even though it was shown at the beginning of the efforts to produce a decent film, it was absolutely horrible - but not in the intended direction, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child was leading this insult to intelligence with the belief that all potential viewers are morons OR extremely demanding in terms of entertainment OR both ... Thank God for the 'fast progress! I can not imagine the type of viewer that the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a scenario that calls for a complete rewrite, ... I just can not say more. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror movies, it would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie entertaining, I strongly suggest you seek advice on the purpose of the movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare there. Join a club, READ THE OPINIONS, but above all avoid bullshit like this.
