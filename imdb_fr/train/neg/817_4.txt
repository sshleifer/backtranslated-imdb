"You're not going to shoot these little creatures, first of all, they did not hurt you, and secondly, they can be radioactive." Ah, the joys of science fiction without budget of the 50s ?? Yet, despite this strange gem, Superman and the Mole-Men are rather tasteless, even with a lean journey of 58 minutes. It's beyond the cheap (the only plane of Superman in flight is incredibly few animated images) and quite annoying, even if the message is surprisingly altruistic? the Mole-Men mutes, tiny actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats that look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without a hat than underground creatures, freed from their underground world by oil drilling are not harmful, but are misunderstood, and George Reeves' man tries to stop the small town crowd led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with a little more than good intentions to recommend it.
