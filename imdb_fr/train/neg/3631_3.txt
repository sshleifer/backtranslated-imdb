Certainly, Parsifal is not an opera that can please everyone, even if it's one of my favorites, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg's whole approach is so static. Whenever the music begins to swell suddenly ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same rate. The catches on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to the film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The spectator is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to go home and replay a recording to confirm that Wagner understood, Syberberg was wrong. And this staging with these "smart" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there be a spectator of this film without any prior knowledge of Wagner?
