The Marquis de Sade, Egypt, the ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, free sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on paper, Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors promises to be at least a fun and entertaining film considering ingredients . It's not. It's a conspiracy less, an incoherent mess that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot, except for something vague, about a cult following the work of De Sade who, for some obscure reason, feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That's about all that - I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the writers thought. Most of the film is a sinister mess while the heroine is exposed to various oddities, sequences of dreams and erotic encounters, interspersed with scenes of Englund as De Sade imprisoned in the nineteenth century chewing the scene. It looks like the manufacturers are looking for something serious, but whatever their pretensions, they are buried in the hair, the bad acting, the sneaky words and decapitated headless heads. <br /> <br /> There are not too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, although she is not very talented, is attractive and undresses at different stages of the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I was able to see the film from which the "When You Are Criminal as Me" piece came from the Australian Film Rating Guide, which was at the head of so many VHS tapes of the eighties. ten.
