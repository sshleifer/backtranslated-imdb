I expect the same excitement I spit on your grave, but I was disappointed by a junk. How can you call it a movie (it's a bit of a mini porn). It made me sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. There is no common thread, he jumps quickly from each murder. If you like to see nude women roles or even men, there are spots in the movie and there is even a masturbation spot in the movie that makes it a porn and not a movie. I've seen idiot movies in my time but it's number 1. I want to be watching again at all. The actors even seem bored during the movie so they probably needed too much money to make this movie.
