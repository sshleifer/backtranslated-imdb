Blame executive producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this big-budget debacle: a thrash-metal update of "Dracula", with a condescending speech jab at Bram Stoker (who probably would not want his name on this thing anyway)) and nothing else for the rest of us, other than slasher style jolts. Christopher Plummer looks vivid like Van Helsing in the modern world - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; he gets out with leeches from Count Dracula's corpse, which is exhumed from his coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's safe and flown to New Orleans. That's exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced but without any original idea (except for multiracial victims), is both repulsive and lazy and, after about an hour, begins to repeat itself. * from ****
