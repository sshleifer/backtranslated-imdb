It may have been based on historical events, and we know that the authors of this television documentary took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was so badly done! In the event of a flight crisis, I was amazed at how calm everyone seemed, someone would have panicked, and what a smooth flight, no apparent discomfort for passengers - go! Not sure about the regulations, some of the airline security issues seem absurd, but why take off his shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! The plans of this massive airliner descending on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and artificial. In fact, it would have been an impressive sight from the nearby ground. In this film, he was out of proportion and looked like the model he was probably. Evacuation slides appeared at the front and central emergency doors, but no one appeared to be coming out from the front even though the fall was much smaller. The captain returned on the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to a fuel outage, but there had to be some fuel running down the tanks, and the risk of an explosion was a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost carefree. and everyone stands at the foot of the evacuation slides instead of going as far as possible, as I surely would have done. There were simply too many inconsistencies, mistakes and wrong actions in this area. I would have preferred to see a representation of the drama in real time and with a realistic movement of the aircraft represented. It might be exciting, but because of budget cuts, it may have failed and made you think that a broken down airplane was not that bad, and that you would risk a bumpy landing. . real danger! - the reality being of course somewhat different!
