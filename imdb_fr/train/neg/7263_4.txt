This Hispanic-British and Star co-production looks great, as you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so much so that it seems that the buildings are talking to each other. Few movies suffer as much from panning and scanning as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at the same time, neglecting the medium. . Another user explains that we see all the inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, a Mexican officer is killed, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that's all. We never find out why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he was called home to play Kojak because his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence in which Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances in a bowler hat and is a valiant costume in the grand tradition of the 1960s BUTTO OF NEW ORLEANS English music hall, not sung here by Johnny Horton but with words I have never heard before. On the positive side, the location is great: a huge fortress in ruins with Escher-style stairs that lead nowhere, beautiful landscapes painted by Robert Shaw and good performances of Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I did not really like this movie, but I have not seen it yet. I'm going to get the big screen version and make my decision then.
