The remake of Alexandre Aja in The Hills Have Eyes was one of the highlights of 2006. It was not only a remake of a classic horror movie, but it was also very good. So, almost a year later, we are treated as a result of this remake. While original screenwriter Wes Craven is back as a producer and co-scriptwriter, this film simply fails to reach the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees stops in the desert to learn about scientists and clash with the mutant family of the first film (at least those who remain some new). There is a lot of gore to have here. What bothers me in this film is the complete lack of characterization. The viewer does not care what happens to these people because we have not known them. Even the mutants had a characterization last time and this time, nothing. Gore for gore is useless. There must be a reason for this to happen to make it interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what about rape scenes in movies lately? Here we get another one without real reason. Hope this is a set of hills that will no longer be visited.
