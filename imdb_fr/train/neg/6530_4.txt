** Spoilers Possible ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a very busy actor in B movies during the forties and fifties, leads an expedition on Mars. Before arriving on the red planet, we are entertained by a romantic argument between Mohr and the scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the view of Les Tremayne as another scientist wearing a goat's beard. Martian exteriors feature false backgrounds and hues ranging from red to pink - the "Cinemagic" process featured in commercials. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect, a very large Venus fly trap and the unforgettable rat / bat / spider. Survivor Hayden remembers this strange adventure under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET would have a great cult, and most of its members probably took part in the psychedelic Sixties.
