In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in this film had a meaning; a TV reporter investigates this case and tries to discover the truth. She ends up killing many, including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then, she shows the world that they exist by transforming themselves into live television. The special effects were just ludicrous in the first movie and they do not improve in this one. Be it transformations or bad puppets or informative graphics showing the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot of the plot is not so bad; they must kill the werewolf leader for some reason. It will not destroy all the werewolves and will not end the werewolf threat because they just want to kill her. I think there was a cloudy reason for that, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the end of the film, we have a 10-minute film about the film we just watched and every other scene is one. where the leader of the werewolves tears up to expose her big breasts while some Devo-Esquire groups play in front of a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this film so interesting to watch is Christopher Lee.
