After a series of power outages on an isolated zoo, genetically modified tigers are on the run and are threatening the inhabitants of the island. Dude, the sci-fi channel has made bad "original" movies, but I think that could be their worst so far! This "Jurassic Park" scam badly written and directed offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientists who think that the people killed by the monsters are "losses perdables", characters walking in long dark corridors, the film must die of a horrible death, etc.) and, unsurprisingly, no suspense whatsoever. The special effects are atrocious - the puppet heads in the big shots of the title critters are already pretty bad, it looks like stiff stuffed dolls, but the CGI - which gives computer-generated dinosaurs to look like life in comparison, are simply terrible. There is gore, but most do not seem convincing. Oh, and the scientist's death scene at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh, it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this one is downright bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting anecdotes for you? This film captures the musical elements of the 2003 science fiction film "Alien Hunter", which was far superior to this piece of shit.
