I attended one of the live performances in Denver and have never been so impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A part of the body. Nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor: "My left arm hurts a bit after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with equal or higher social comment. It could be the "Triceps Monologues" for all the radical or entertainment comments I've heard. The monologues were monotonous but delivered with the drama, the subjects were obsolete, and I was bored and bored in turn. Once I think I laughed but apparently it was not when I was supposed to do it. It's certainly not a success. Oh, and spoilers: there was a lesbian! - Oh, wait, maybe not, come to think about it. And inappropriate caresses! And a crack mom! That is just about everything.
