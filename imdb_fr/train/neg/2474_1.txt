As I watched this film, I thought: OK, it'll be fine at any time ... I was wrong. The best part of this movie was when it was finished. A total loss of 92 minutes. All that is serious is that the best is when the Wendigo came to the end and you could not even see it as well. And the tail was really a little silly too. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but that was disappointing. The worst thing was that Wendigo was more about Wendigo than Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you absolutely can not tell by this movie.
