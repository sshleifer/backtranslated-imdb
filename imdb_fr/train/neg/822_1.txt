There are really two sections of this movie. First, there is the ludicrous prologue of the film that is so hysterical and insane that it seems almost appropriate that Troy McClure of the Simpsons narrates. <br /> <br /> Then starts the rest of the movie (starting with a title song that really does not fit with the rest of the movie) which, although technically OK, is killed by a vague, incoherent and unconvincing plot , and not just by uninteresting characters, but by characters that make no sense. <This is particularly the case with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who was supposed to participate in the plot and be part of the "organization" throughout history, but what would have happened if Hackman had made the decision apparently arbitrary to take him with him? burst? In this case, he would have been a completely superfluous and useless person, which he always ends up being. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the film is that it totally refuses to specify who or what. is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to imply that a certain part of society would be able to create such an organization, but rather to hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and that the public would draw his own conclusions. To summarize, the film fails at all levels.
