This film left an impression forever. I watched him as a freshman in high school and I was home alone that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor, after being a big fan of Brady Bunch. I also thought that Chuck Connor's role was horrible and perverse. However, this film has had such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the State Women's Prison, doing Bible studies and religious services and trying to change the lives of women, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people have watched this movie. None of my friends have looked at it and my family is so distraught to date when I discuss this film because they have not seen it.
