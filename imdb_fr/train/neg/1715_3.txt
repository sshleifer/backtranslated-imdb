Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They took a lot of freedom in rearranging events, excluding people and using sets that do not fit the facts of their lives in the thirties. There was more than Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gang at various times, and these people had as much to do with the facts as those who were included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go directly much earlier than the shooting, and in fact, they returned to the crime. Some of the events described in broad daylight occurred at night. Bonnie's injury was much worse and never healed well. It was so bad that she had to be carried by someone until everything was cured, and even then she stiffened and walked stiffly. Clyde also limped because in prison he cut a big toe. I know I'm a bit difficult, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this "TRUE" story, the movie moves too fast from one event to another and appears more like several separate shots , rather than being a fluid and consistent story. <br /> <br /> I would advise you to read a book or watch a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
