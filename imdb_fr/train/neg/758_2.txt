This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to look for something good for them. It is usually educational, fun and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No, the Doodlebops are singing and that's all. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to teach. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. Doodlebops say something that is not meant to be a joke and laughs at it. <br /> <br /> Is it brilliant? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as colors are concerned, everything is extremely brilliant, that's good. But NOTHING is never wrong in the world of Doodlebop. Therefore, they are always happy. a troubled child will become depressed because he has never been exposed to being sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely old-fashioned. Each syllable is said to be at the highest level of exaggeration and very old-fashioned. It's exaggerated. <br /> <br /> For children, it's fun, but after the age of 2, you will not want your kids to see it anymore. They will never know how to grow.
