Start with the script. I saw drawings with more depth than "Envy". Whenever characters repeat what you've already seen, and it was not funny the first time, a movie is in great trouble, which "Envy" certainly is. A film based on a joke would have better than a place to go with. We have here a movie that is absolutely not going anywhere. Christopher Walken would especially like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak. We immediately think of Ben Stiller in very good black comedies "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex". Be certain that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low note, because, as for the subject, it stinks. - MERK
