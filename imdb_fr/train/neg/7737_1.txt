Around the world, who told Harrison Ford that it was a good role for him ??? <br /> <br /> And Josh Hartnett ... how does a 19-year-old who can not use a gun become a cop? Clich√©s too used, no more character development and about 15 useless cameos from the music industry equivalent to a surprisingly bad movie !!!
