It's the most clich√©d and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is worthy of the name and the two main actors - Corey and Danny are really boring. Corey is very stupid and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the murderer of Urban Legend are the only redeeming assets of this mediocre film endeavor. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to sleep - Corey looks like he's in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; this film is not smooth. 1/10 avoid
