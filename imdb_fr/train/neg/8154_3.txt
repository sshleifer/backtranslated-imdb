The long list of "big" names in this film (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not really upset me that I could not judge the film of its real merit. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures and classic sets, from the humble hero of aerial tunes to virulent and virulent flyers. The music was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: crescendo loud and up, great success and then silence, but the film continued! I did not find any real storyline, random writing, but elegantly tight uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons (prep work) with a catchy little song. I can not say that this picture has any of the ingredients that make a great movie. I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
