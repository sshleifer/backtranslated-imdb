I spent eight years running cinemas in the '80s and' 90s. It was by far the worst film I've ever shown to the public. One thing that made things so bad was that he seemed to want to be a great inspirational film. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this horrible piece of drivel from being much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first role in the non-horror movie, has clearly shown that she has not yet learned to play (she's still trying, but it's not much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. and here is the detail: international nuclear disarmament will never happen simply because children are afraid of playing baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that. <br /> <br /> It's not worth wasting your time watching it on cable TV. This is not worth the price of a movie rental; your money would be better spent on an extra package of popping corn in the microwave to go with the other movie you have chosen (because it can only be better than that).
