I'm currently browsing the Horror Classics 50 film collection and REVOLT OF THE THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the series. I watch them with my seven-year-old daughter soon, which makes most of these films laugh. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after watching White Zombie, which is really the precursor of so many things that are the mainstay of zombies in the cinema (think about the funeral scene Live and Let Die by Clive Barker, The Rainbow and James Bond, NOT at Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> However, even if the title includes the word "zombies", it is little more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist Armand Louque, loving Claire Duval; who in turn is caught with his mate Clifford Grayson. What a yawning party, my daughter fell asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time deciphering who these people worked for - the allies or the axis; but, I guess it does not really matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits of this film; but, of course, it was his eyes (of White Zombie) serving as a mental control device to the zombies.
