I can enjoy a guilty self-defense film, but it's just bad. And not bad, in a way that could make you happy to see MST3K make fun of him. It is nauseatingly serious because you can not find anything to appreciate, no matter how hard you try. I really regret losing 2 hours of precious life on this shit. You can see by watching that nobody was invited to play and that everyone knew that this movie was only going to bury their career. Apparently, "Walking Tall" has generated enough revenue for someone to decide to make money with his investment. If it's not the worst film I've seen, it's so bad that it has erased the worst movies from my memory.
