I saw her recently with my wife and found out it was better than Caine believes, even if it's not a lot of cop. The greatest British actor of all time on the screens does not seem too interested in this role, which is a shame because he could have raised it with more conviction in his roles. Rex Harrison seems even less disturbed, perhaps unsurprisingly, because his character is very badly written. William Holden is better, but his on-screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a woman as beautiful as I have ever seen her, but she is given little to do. , the film could have gained a lot by focusing more on its story. Ustinov steals the show, but essentially playing a cartoon character that does not match the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many useless cameos (his career has been based on this principle for decades). <br /> <br /> We must blame Richard Fleischer for not having directed this more effectively, he was an incredibly unpredictable filmmaker, and this is one of his weakest films.
