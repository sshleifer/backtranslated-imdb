Mary Pickford becomes the leader of a Scottish clan after the death of his father, then has a romance. As his colleague Snow Leopard said, the movie is rather episodic to begin with. Some are funny, like Pickford bringing his clan men to church, while others are there. Overall, the story is weak, especially the plot of recycled artificial romance and its climax. The transfer is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the landscape, but even taking into account that, it does not seem to be the best work of the director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur have once again collaborated on The Poor Little Rich Girl, which is a little more accessible, and turns Pickford into a childish character.
