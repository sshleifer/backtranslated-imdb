This direct death rattle from the Tremors series contains sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you'll know it when you see it) and more boredom and stuffing than it's possible to shake a stick. Tremors 4 was obviously shot down with an extremely small budget. That means they only had enough special effect mojo for three or four minutes of men-to-man violence. Dull melt, clich√© cast and hackneyed writing mean that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience lasts at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore fans of Tremors will be able to sit down and let alone enjoy this movie. If you are not among them, do not worry.
