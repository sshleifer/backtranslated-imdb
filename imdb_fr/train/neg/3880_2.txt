I can watch a good movie gore from time to time. I saw some pretty sick stuff. However, it's one of the few films I've found grotesque in a very repulsive and outrageous way. I like gore movies when they are fun. I like when they have a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this film is not creative. It's sick. It's disgusting. It is completely unpleasant. For this reason, this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film, but it lacks fears. So, practically, the only reason we watch this movie is for gore, but it's the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and that says a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot is meaningless, and the music is really boring and sounds too electronic. All this took me straight out of the movie. Almost all the film is a long and painful ordeal. There is this guy who has an accident accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to find that his skin dissolves and dissolves. I guess after that, he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the process of fusion. There is a strange secondary plot involving an old couple being chased by a dog, a dismembered head that floats on a stream and an end involving a man electrocuted. There were times when I was really trying to have fun, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was even fun was when a nurse was idling down the hallway of a hospital. If you like ugly, ugly and unattractive horror movies, this one is for you.
