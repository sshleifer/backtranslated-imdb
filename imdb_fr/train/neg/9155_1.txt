This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was like a "homework" for a movie class. It totally misses the target with regard to the "message" that it is TRYING to relay. The characters are too exaggerated, the acting is mediocre and as for the plot ... well, it's completely ridiculous. The cover photo is what made me think that it may be a decent film, the co-actor is beautiful and that's about it. Moral of this film: NEVER JUDGE A FILM BY HIS COVER! Save your time, money and energy and make your own movie at home and you'll be better off than me. It was painful to watch and, frankly, I'm surprised someone spends money on making and distributing it!
