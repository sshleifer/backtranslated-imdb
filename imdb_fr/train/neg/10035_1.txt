Absolutely horrible film. A total loss of time. <br /> <br /> The background music is so loud that you can not understand speech. Well, if you listen carefully, whatever their spoken language, they are really incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is bad, the editing is not present, the background score gives headache, the actions are mediocre, the dialogues are incomprehensible, the The game is catastrophic Well, Kareena looked like a wrestler, now she looks like a hungry wrestler. You can lose weight but you can not win grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie, I want to love it, but this movie would not even let me enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead, look.
