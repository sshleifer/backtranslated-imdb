It is a typical production of the novel Steele to the extent that two people who have experienced a kind of tragedy manage to meet despite the difficulties. I would not call it a spoiler, because anyone who reads a Steele novel knows how they end ALL. If you do not want to know more about the plot, do not stop reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French descent who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert must stop making films where she is obliged to have an accent because she, if not a good actress, can not under any circumstances draw a realistic accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip. At first, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked about art with the child. . All become friends after this episode and the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leaders is not great, even if the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did their best with a predictable plot and a scenario close to stereotypes. Two people meet, a tragedy, a bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they meet again. I wish there had been more than that, but here are a few words. <br /> <br /> I wanted a brainless entertainment, and I understood it. As for the genre of romantic movies, this one is not memorable. "A secret affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (it's not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's previous books turned into a film.
