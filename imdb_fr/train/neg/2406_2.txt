In the mind of Harry Alan Towers, there is another piece of film mud. Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity he has with what he actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (even though Africa has dinosaurs) that our intrepid adventurers use to shoot their canoes!) some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) search for treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up right where the treasure is, luckily. On the way, they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters, take a French chef and McCallum has an affair with the queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous. That's the only reason I did not give a 1.
