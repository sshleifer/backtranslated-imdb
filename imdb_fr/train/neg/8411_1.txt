We were expecting something big when we went to see this bomb. This is a Broadway play. The music is just terrible. There is not a memorable song in the movie - heard hits from this movie? You will not do it because there is not one. Some music numbers last so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and have popcorn, and everything happened when I got home! If they were good songs - but they are nil. The pace is slow, the development of the character is terrible. We had praised her lead role for her singing, but she seemed to scream every song - it was almost impossible to stay up. This film has NOTHING to offer anyone except Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most overrated movie I've seen in my life. A full size of time and money. This film is not memorable except for Danny Glover - who was not enough on the screen and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Rent the video and you will agree - this movie was an expensive dog, over-produced and polite.
