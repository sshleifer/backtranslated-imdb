I left several years on these panels because of the lack of intelligence that is communicated in the critics that appear periodically on the IMDb space of this film. I saw this film courtesy of Subway Cinema's Asian New York Film Festival (which featured an excellent selection of films this year, see Vital, June Snake, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regretted every day the scene of this film. takes me out of my mind and becomes a living memory. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read a glowing summary of the movie on Subway Cinema, which probably explains why I made the mistake of dragging my friend to the movie. The description built the kind of horror film I had long dreamed of, a film based on pure terror rather than economic fears. P was actually different. He was leaning on cheap laughter. <br /> <br /> The incredibly annoying announcer has described this film as "lesbians teaming up to fight monsters". Completely false. There is a secondary plot built in this film to give the impression that the relationship between the girl and Pookie is disappearing. No more lies. This film looks like a short film for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and only managed to arouse the laughter and confusion of the public after finally canceling its attempt to look at this film with a semblance of seriousness and trying to forget the 9 dollars they had wasted at the door. I almost wish Paul Spurrier was in the audience so he could laugh at him and ask him why he lost 5 years in Thailand doing a badcore horror porn from the spice chain, which did not managed to convince the actress excommunicated by her family and caused a little stir at the Belgian film festival. The only hustle and bustle it caused was gurgling in the lower gut, because he could not get out of the skin he is. Anyway, I hope I can dissuade anyone from making the big mistake of seeing this movie. It was really one of my three worst cinematic experiences: knocking out Soulplane for number 2.
