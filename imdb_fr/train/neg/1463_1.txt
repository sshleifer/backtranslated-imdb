Just imagine that the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been a whisper such as Carlyle described it in this film. <br /> <br /> Nobody would have followed, not even a hopeless, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a Hollywood propaganda cardboard, disguised as "true story". <br /> <br /> I pity everyone who believes in the content of this show. Carlyle and the producers have not understood that. <br /> <br /> Why did Hitler win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we were a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By describing him as a loser, they make their own film in a totally incredible way. This film is a mix of old World War II propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important personalities of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is a shame and I wonder how they could convince an actor like Carlyle to live in this chaos.
