IMDb's guidelines state that you must declare if your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> well, this whole movie is a sort of spoiler ... an uplifting story that glorifies what he's warning against, a lost youthful narrative that does not know where he's going to go- even. <br /> <br /> I just saw that at the Tribeca Film Festival. this movie was not only bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is incoherent, the characters are mostly shot offerings with little depth, and the Farnsworth game was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> condescending accents to the useless line of lines to the graphic elements "moved" to the repetitive dialogue and the scenarios ... that's the hunk. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a more modern kind of "pharmacy cowboy", with a touch of "natural-born killers" but nowhere is it as sensitive to the characters as the previous and nowhere else as shocking (apart from some gore frate level) as the ladder. <br /> <br /> more than anything, it took someone to really A) edit the scenario <br /> <br /> (there are some things out there on which to build and clearly <br /> <br /> offers with a worthy subject ... if his attempt is well done.) B) mount the film. if it were reduced to a nucleus, it could be passable. <br /> <br /> I would like to go lower than 1 if I could ... like maybe zero Kelvin.
