Okay, let me tell you that I did not expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be a film of gold, all I asked was that it be a movie ... and it was not even that. It looked like someone was going badly at home. Badly acted, scripted and filled to the brim with the nakedness of the most unattractive people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> "The plot" of the film is centered on a lower class family who decides to "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss several cases between a mother, a daughter, a father-in-law and the bride of the girl. From there, the movie freezes and turns into a unique experience: white pornography. There is sex in redneck, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to leave the theater and to have a second circumcision performed. At least it was fortunately short. Disgusting and degrading. African Americans and the American working class should be offended. (Howard Stern should be happy, however, he did not give up on his cinematic celebrity attempt - he was smart, funny and entertaining.) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (the girl was hot)
