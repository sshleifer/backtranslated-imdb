The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up for the mothers of convicted murderers. With the notoriety after the trial, the two women team up and leave New York for California to open a singing and dancing studio for girls resembling Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it becomes obvious that Reynolds made a mistake by taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems to be growing out of her rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women living together receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who dons a blonde wig, is quickly seduced by the wealthy father of one of his students, nicely interpreted by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her latest films, is briefly considered Sister Alma, to whom Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Shelley Winters. It is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make it even better. Winters have always played well in the roles, putting their nerves to the test. <br /> <br /> The end is the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano playing with this crazy look?
