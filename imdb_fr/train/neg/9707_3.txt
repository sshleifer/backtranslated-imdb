It was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD and, under the film, I found myself irritated and I still turned off the film. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 They were running at the father's place <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 the dinosaurs (for the most part) seemed to be wrong <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist and he was boring <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the images on the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I liked: <br /> <br /> 1 The music of Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have the bootleg soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it is suitable for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see dinosaurs, they inspire a kind of fear. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby is kinda cute when he's in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 This fun scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 The children who see this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses.
