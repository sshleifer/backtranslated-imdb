he was my hero for all time until he came with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and get out and not ask me for money back but I asked for double the money. The role of the hero and the hole was ............. I can not believe that Steven Segal's career was so low that he was reduced to making 4th quality films with Secondary actors of 5th quality. I watched this move as I waited for him to fart the mouths of some people as he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo shot between the shoulder blades to defeat an opponent, the guy falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is incredible as a film, and even if you excuse the visuals and if you read this story as a novel, you may wonder why you chose the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal does his job and seems to be as if he is. Only because he is under obligation. He shows no effort or enthusiasm and in some scenes he does not show up at all. <br /> <br /> I do not like to repeat other people's comments, but using archival footage for cinematic scenes and images of the plane in flight is pathetic. The state of these scenes is unstable, and the scenes themselves seem to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder movie showing the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is more stable and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My sincere opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it does not live up to its job the glow or wounds man. I read a review that said the movie had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal being paid 5% of that) and that the film was still below budget. I agree. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder this is a direct DVD movie, as no conscientious theater owner would want to play this movie.
