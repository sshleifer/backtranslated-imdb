I watched this movie for about 30 minutes before I finally got tired of hurting my head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot", and each actor. It's as if they all thought they were the main part of the movie and shouted "NOTICE ME!" again and again. The villain has his nasty music and says sinister things like those of the wicked, just in case you did not understand it. The good guy does brave and noble things in case you do not know. And oh Lord, the scene of the plane. "MY WIFE IS MISSING! OH MY GOD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE GOT TO STRETCH HEADS OR GO TO TOILET OR SOMETHING, HE MUST BE MISSING!" (And yes, I know, her clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic even before she had time to look at the bloody seat she was in.) <br /> < br /> As a nun, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film on which it was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
