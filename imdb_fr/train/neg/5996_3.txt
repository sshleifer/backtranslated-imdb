Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> With: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! The Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> That's how Thunderbirds started, one of my childhood favorites. When I heard they were going to make a movie about the Thunderbirds, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the idea, you see the idea. I could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the film was finally released. Critics swept it away, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as my heart was in the same place, it was all that mattered to me. So I sat at the theater, the only teenager among a crowd of 50 - everyone was over thirty and under. Probably the most delicate theatrical experience of my life ?? <br /> <br /> The film (intended to be a prequel) is centered on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing to save people like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day, he finally had a chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) trapped the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This implies that he must outwit the Hood's henchmen and save his family in time for The Hood to steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the plot sounds like a normal episode of Thunderbirds. when you read it on paper. Once the film is filmed, what mess we have in our hands. First of all, the film was intended for children, just like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us fairly advanced plots for children's programming. On the other hand, it complicates the plot and tries to make a scam of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that is trying to please fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while missing them completely. This film contains dark jokes, cartoon sounds and silly antics that no one really thinks is fun, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wants to never realize it. <br /> <br /> At the base, everyone gave a solid performance, given the scenario that was given to them. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing this role extremely well. My only criticism about the characters is the henchmen of The Hood, who are reduced to the remnants of old Looney Tunes cartoons. They are stunned to see the children face them with ease. <br /> <br /> The film is that while I watched the movie, I had fun. But once the lights were on, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I had $ 8 less, and two hours of my time are gone now. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps. Nevertheless, Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess. Instead of a big "go", I will have to recommend you to stay away from this movie. If the rest of the movie had been like the first ten minutes, it was an incredible movie worthy of the Thunderbirds name. However, we get a movie that will only appeal to Thunderbirds fans (if you want to watch your childhood torn) or to extremely bored ones. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
