This movie was a mess. There was the worst editing I have ever seen. It was almost as if, at the end of a scene, the writer wanted to go public, and the filmmaker added a second black screen to realize his dream. <br /> <br /> Under the guidance and messy editing, there was a glimmer of something good. A good idea, a convincing spark. But somewhere, it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about an almost psychic priest trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is difficult to master is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the party does not ask him to be a good priest and he's doing pretty well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy villain. He always plays the crazy villain. Oh, really, blah. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought all the jerky and horrible editing and the offline plot was trying to add a sense of confusion about the character (Grieco). And just to prove it was artificial, they returned the credits keywords. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
