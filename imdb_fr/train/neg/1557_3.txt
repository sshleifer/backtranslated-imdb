The film is essentially a boring chain of dreadful clich√©s that do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. The part of the trip to the Middle East is particularly irritating: there are of course mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palms were missing from the set. The personality of the two main characters is very awkwardly sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The initial idea may have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you're looking for a cultural overview, you have to skip this movie.
