I had seen this film at the age of 10 years old. Even at that age, humor slightly insulted the intelligence of my adolescence. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum, I would cringe and start feeling very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. Until I am reminded of the existence of this movie today, I did not know why I felt so. Apparently, I blocked the memory of this film, but my negative feelings towards two of the authors remained. Apparently, I forgot that I saw this film but I unconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, even EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I did not have the courage to try to look at him. like an adult. I imagine that, as part of the healing process, I should probably consider dealing with this fear of childhood so that I * really * can leave it behind. Regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.
