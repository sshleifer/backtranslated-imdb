Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and it gets worse. Katherine Heigl plays sadly in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo fiercely fights against what is essentially a character cut from cardboard. Tom Sizemore is the only member of the cast to have enthusiasm. He pretends to be a villain and exaggerates completely with his role. The script is disastrous, the acting is horrible and it has parcel holes big enough to pass a double-decker bus! It's also the most sexist movie I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely unfriendly. She is perceived as a perverse and gratuitous seducer who attracts the poor innocent married man to deceive his wife. Throughout the film, it is implicit that she is minor and the message that accompanies it simply complicates the plot. In the end, she is not even able to redeem herself by shooting at the man who is obviously (ah!) In rage and guilt, but the scenario allows her to commit suicide, thus redeeming herself men's eyes all over the world. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
