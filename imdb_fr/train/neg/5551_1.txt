How did this shit stay on TV for so long? It's terrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. It's so wrong that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie of the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than look at that nonsense. I remember seeing him when he came out for the first time. I thought, hey it might be interesting, then I found out how ridiculously stupid it was. It was so bad that I pulled out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please, stop watching this and all the other reality shows, it is the waste that blocks the networks. and canceling quality programming that requires thinking to create.
