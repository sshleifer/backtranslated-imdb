When you get your hands on a British film, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, working with a camera, lighting, etc. this film does the trick. It is made by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can give you a pleasant hour and a half. But when you look under layers of professionalism, you can not find anything. Apart from making you feel good and defending a liberal view of the drug, there is really nothing there. The scenario is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In summary, it is a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they do this movie? I have no idea, apart from making money of course.
