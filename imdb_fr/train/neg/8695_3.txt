Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the ADA of Law and Order and her game is even worse here. His attempts to get a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; from time to time, while her daughter is away, she only sounds vaguely annoyed, as if she can not remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is a true and important story, so it's a shame that the terrible role of the leading actress distracts the message so much. The rest of the cast is quite talented, but they simply can not overcome Rohm's tendency to simply pose on a particularly thick imitation of a pulling south whenever it is necessary to act.
