First of all, I'm not here to watch this movie. I find it totally pleasant despite the poor quality of the production. To act here is about as bad as the monster that harasses them, though the monster itself is pretty well done ... awfully well done at that. He really looks like another world, an extraterrestrial family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while his father was answering ... the call of nature, Spot escaped and they just did not get the time to hunt him down. That, or it's the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster. I have not decided which one yet. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems to have been filmed somewhere in a snow-covered country, yes, but more likely in Canada somewhere than China, anywhere. Trees and panoramas tell me Canada, and it is not surprising that the chosen region never gives the air or the sensation of extreme cold that one would expect to find in the Chinese Himalayas. It's a movie from the Sci-Fi channel, so we can forgive the lack of space. <br /> <br /> In addition, apparently (as we have just said), sci-fi directors do not travel often because they are not aware that commercial aircraft fly above the weather, as described herein, and the accident that followed would not have taken place. But as I said, it's a movie from Sci-Fi, so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes quite graphic, and turns between "Alive" about Giving Party, "Predator" about the alien in the woods, and any bad wushu movie where they fly on wires. The Yeti apparently can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... do you remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer!" <br /> <br /> In addition, the Yeti missed his teddy bear. He has sought high and low for this, but does not seem to be able to operate a corpse. Poor Yeti! You can not help but be sorry for that. He survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to a serious loss of teddy bears. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but that thought is banned! You hear me? Well, it seems like an unmarried man. REBANISÃ‰! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But again, what is normal - Yeti? I do not know, but it has a quality defined by Michael Meyers that is completely disturbing. And he has this fabulous way of cleaning his fur. Fabulous Dahlink! He is spotlessly white in times when it should NOT be. He is fastidiously superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was very entertaining to watch, there were some excellent exploits and some honest plot elements. Despite the horribly gritty production style, it's actually pretty fun. I can not help wondering if they plan another one? <br /> <br /> He scores 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> He notes 4.4 / 10 on the film scale of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
