The performance of Timberlake almost made attack the screen. It was not so bad, I just think that the role of journalist was bad for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical role of the rapper, the hardest and the meanest of the surroundings. I do not think that the smile cracked throughout the film, not even when it was proposed to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman took almost everything in the film. He had some fun scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was neither good nor bad, he was just "there". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a dull film. bad plot. many bad roles or bad roles for the actors.
