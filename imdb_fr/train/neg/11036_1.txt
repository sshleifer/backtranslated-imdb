It must be the most secret TV show. It's probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent, he younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never talked about again except for negative purposes. Jim has to retire or something like that. Please let them leave the air. If I joke with this show, I will vomit and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I would rather be devilish than watching half an hour of this program. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air. We all know deep inside that we want to turn our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
