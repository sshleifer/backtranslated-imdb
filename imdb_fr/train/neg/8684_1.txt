Abyssal with a capital "A". This must be one of the cheapest TV shows, if not LA. I am about as anti-bush, but this show does not even make me laugh. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you like this shitty show. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where Lil Bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!" There is nothing funny about it. Is it even supposed to be a joke? The ads that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show were more fun than the show itself, and it's really sad. Hope this is not even considered for a second season. It should not even have been a first.
