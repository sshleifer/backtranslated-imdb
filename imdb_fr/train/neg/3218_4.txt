I found this film to be an interesting study of causes and effects, but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate or otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is promising, but I think it does not keep its promises. We spend too much time talking about the theory of chaos to the audience and too little to show it. As a result, I never really felt any of the characters and I never made good relationships with them emotionally. At the end of the film, I had an attitude "so what" about them. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie awesome, but as it stands, it's just great.
