In sixth grade, every teacher I chose to make this film the semester curriculum would be a great idea. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We watched it in English and wrote in newspapers as if we were one of the characters. In math, we talked about cards and other shits. In science, we talked about whales (which was actually quite interesting, so it was not a 100% waste of time). All day, every day was a torture. Not only that, but they would submit us to this horror twice a day by making us look also in the study room. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was like 1993. I'm still trying to block this.
