Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) kills his child and violently attacks his wife during a home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him overcome post-traumatic stress. Then Archer is confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) tied up and gagged to a chair. He is told that it is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and that he can do what he wants. And there is a wide assortment of instruments to help him ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting at first (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and blood) but becomes stupid at the minute and has very unlikely plot twists. Everything ends with an ultimate twist so old and stupid that I was shocked that anyone thinking of using it anymore. How are such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer mixed up with shit like this? That gives three stars to the acting, but the stupid plot and the really incredible twists make it a chore to cross.
