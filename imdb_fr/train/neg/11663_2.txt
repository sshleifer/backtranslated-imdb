WHITE CHICKS Wait, why could not they get dressed in Black Chicks, oh yes, they would not look different at all. Can anyone give me a Wayans movie where they did not disguise themselves as ladies? Do not be a threat does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza Ghost wrote it (the other members of the Norton Trio acted as directors). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there's never really any jokes. It's just the Wayans who act like girls for 2 hours. There is no configuration, no punchlines and no laughing. There are a lot of "I think I'll play Time Crisis 3." At least for me, there were (5 times to be exact). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans to stop to make movies. It's only hurting the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * on ****
