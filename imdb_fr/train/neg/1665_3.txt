It was a decent movie, I actually enjoyed it. But the end is so sudden !! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of tips. What happens after the concert? What's going on with her boyfriend? Does she connect with Grant? Does she come beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance would turn Angela's ankles upside down, but nothing indicates how she reacts. There is so much in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if he's trying to make room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible end and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
