Was this movie stupid? Yep. Does this film have a depth? Nope. Character development? Nope. Reversal of situation? Nope. It was just a movie about a highly fictional Springer series. This shows the efforts some people will make to get their cup on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is ... well ... BEAUTIFUL! This film was not really meant to be a "revolutionary" film, but rather for life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like this movie) where everyone world sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant with different boys, and all drive rusty Ford pickup trucks from 1966 (hype, of course, but that's what everyone sees when we talk about "trailer park" ). Some people over-analyze movies (example: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies only for entertainment; not to mention that the girl wears a different shirt in a different scene (read the word "Goofs" about Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better, of course, but it was funny like hell.
