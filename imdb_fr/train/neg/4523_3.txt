When this film was released, it generated one of the best capsule film reviews of all time: Sphinx Stinks. This is the case, but in a fascinating way. The cast is silly, starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud in Egyptian? Not enough makeup in Cairo for this, at least not during the making of this film. But it's pretty fun to watch them try. The performances go from the granny (sorry, the obvious observation) to the top, with very few stops between the two. The character of Lesley-Anne Down seems not to have found Egypt on a map, let alone expose its archaeological treasures. This is due at least in part to a very bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited by all viewers of this film. In my opinion, films involving a curse or drawing their basis from a somewhat esoteric subject, such as egyptology, are ripe for a stupid and crushed dialogue. It does not disappoint and convergence is a double blow. The plot has a driving source of dramatic tension: can it be more stupid and less credible? The answer is usually YES. The shots are beautiful and the design of the sets is usually very good, which only reminds that it was not a low-budget production. This and the fact that there are so many well-known faces that serve in such ridiculous laughter. Cheap, no; nerdy, yes.
