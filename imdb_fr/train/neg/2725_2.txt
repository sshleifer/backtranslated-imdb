Gringo Chesty Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexican "Border Policeman". He serves as a father figure to the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (under the name of Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best of men at his impending wedding. Savalas is tough, but Chief Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be harder. We must fight against the smuggler, Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances can be changing. <br /> <br /> If you find that the possibility of hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" utter excessive speech is repugnant, you must avoid "The Border". If this is not the case, you may not be ready for the "realistic" scene of culling cows. Although it is not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
