My sincere advice to all: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even approach the theater where this movie is played! even having a glimpse of it is bad for your health. serious. no jokes. it is 3:30 in the morning. and I came back from this craziest film in this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I'm proud to have survived after all! If it's called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was a waste of time! the money went down the drain! no land. I hope to get up tomorrow sane and without memories of this night !! RUBBISH FILM. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to all of you :)
