To say that this film stinks would be insulting to the skunks. As the other speaker said, this film is insulting to those over 7 (it is particularly insulting to gay men). It's awful - and not in a genre "so bad that it's funny" either - it's just awful. No, I have to say it: THAT STINKS! (sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the opening credits to the last title, there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie that is worth opening your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the characterization does not exist, the acting is super aggression "look at me I'm funny!" school and so on. The pieces are badly mounted (if any) and poorly executed. It's horrible on every level - apart from the music, I may not remember having thought that music stinks (apart from the songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the makers, they put their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title "Also featuring Ertha Kitt as Betty's voice the meteor" (Since the meteor in question turns out never to never say anything but purrs occasionally, they might have removed Ms. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie looks pretty much the same to: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your anus" geddit? Geddit? eh? huh ?? Your anus? Humor is really cheap. <br /> <br /> That said strange things about the "comedies" of that time, in that it was perfectly permissible for the hero to deliberately shoot dead people in the street without saying "sh * t "out loud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel torn.
