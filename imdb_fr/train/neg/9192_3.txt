I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. This seems logical since most zombie movies have their place. From the "Dead" trilogy of Romero to "28 days later". However, by viewing it, you can quickly see what this film actually is. <br /> <br /> This is actually a music video that goes faster and faster and becomes more and more bloody. There is no horror here people. Some decent mid-way action scenes that quickly become tiring because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you'll feel like you're a DVD player, you accidentally jumped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they did the movie. Too bad. I think anyone could find a better use of $ 7 million in the film industry than to make that bite of a stove. Even though some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but again, they were overused and tedious because it was the same stuntman every time, with just a different character. <br /> <br /> ROYALLY boring is the collage of sequences from the arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie, but a video clip, and it's a mediocre movie. 3/10 <br /> <br /> R rated: a lot of violence / bloody and profanity
