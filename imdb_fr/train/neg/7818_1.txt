Usually, I do not go out of a movie, but halfway through. This film promised something different, but I kept thinking that I had never seen it before? Spoil alert! Back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on Earth, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board, nothing less, this thing always manages to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to be able to develop a landing gear? For such a liberal industry, we have the chance to see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks please! Superman saves himself by saving people, making sure he stays in Europe and the United States, do not go into dark areas please. I could perhaps endure that about 30 years ago, but now now.
