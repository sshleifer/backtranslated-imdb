Ok, I went in this movie without waiting too much. I thought of an action movie similar to The Fast and the Furious. Beautiful beautiful girls cars a bit of a decent plot. Unfortunately, I must say it was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were nice and the girls were good, but the way they put the movie together was simply disappointing. The story never interested you, and the movie seemed quite assembled. So overall, this movie was not by far the worst thing of all time, but if you're looking for a movie for this weekend, I'll skip this one for now.
