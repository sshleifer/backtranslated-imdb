I've watched this movie a few times and all I can say is that it's low budget garbage and it has nothing to do with a real story. The performances of the actors are very mediocre but result from limited playing possibilities. Anyone who has watched this film now thinks of Hitler as a mad and skinny madman who runs with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of Evil is way below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall in which you can see the brilliant interpretation of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
