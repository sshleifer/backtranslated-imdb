Shecky is a legend, do not be fooled. Until recently, I worked for a chain of HiFi & Video retailers in the UK, leading their testing service. We would have a lot of new entrants, they would have to learn to find the various detritus that come back as non-functional one way or another in the shops. Now, to test the determination of these new staff members, we would send them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because every person who bought a particular model of DVD player Goodmans and offered free this movie turned to return their DVD player, they never failed to return Shecky. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines until they found one or two disks to test. <br /> <br /> Now, why is this movie so bad? Where should I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be so funny, like in Happy Gilmore, or the singer of Wedding Wedding, had to spend a busy day. The rest of the crew stank, and what about Billy Zane? His name is in many of the worst films of all time and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The quality of production is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would have tended to give him a zero if I could, because they did not even have the guts to call him by his full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz on Liberation." if it's worth watching, you'll see how far Sandler has gone and how far he can go.
