It could have been a good episode but I just had to turn it off. The British performance was horrible to watch. Have the producers already set foot in Britain before filming? At least set foot in England ?? I do not think that British people had such an accent, except for a comic sketch of the royal family! Also with the 2 English boys ... well, I do not think that an English boy acted, talked or dressed like an English child in the history of the British nation since Prince William's pre-teenage public appearances and from Harry. To American directors. There is more than one country in the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland ... meaning more than one culture! I can handle some stereotypes but it was so bad that I could not watch it. The fire looked cool anyway!
