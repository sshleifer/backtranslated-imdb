I've heard a lot of stories about the quality of this movie ... Well, I tried my luck when I saw it at Ebay last month for a great price. <br /> <br /> I watched it and I have only a few comments on it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible scenario, 2) Terrible actor, 3) Bad scenes of fighting. .. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a worst movie of my life, far !! When the scenario is bad, make at least one more interesting fight. But both are ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only good thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about all ...
