I may not have found the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default value is OFF. When the final credits started rolling, I could not believe it was that. Like our poor but beautiful protagonist, I felt worn, dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn very widely and the writer's disdain for the rich Thatcherites was too apparent. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem could come from me. I see that many others seem to find a meaning or a message in this image. Alas, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that stopped me from giving a "1" was the beautiful landscape, human and plant.
