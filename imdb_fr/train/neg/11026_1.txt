I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was horribly inaccurate. It's like they have a list of names and everything invented. His burglaries and escapades were well planned, to the nearest second. Once the time is up, they are gone, whether they have all the money or not. They had notes on every road, where to turn, and so on. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant. He was told that Dillinger had paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even saw his Dillinger before the night of his assassination, only pictures of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger never stole a bank by himself, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie. The acting was a bit exaggerated in places. The action was also exaggerated. When you think about it, I doubt that I would have liked it even if I had not read the book.
