Okay, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. He tries to scare by simply having a weird camera job and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for example, how would the health center know that Yoko had not come to work while the people who lived in the house were not there? And what Bill Pullman's character had to do with something is not really clear. He just came out of nowhere to advance the plot. What happened to the family of origin does not really make sense. Who was hanging in the room, the boy or the father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the guy from the health center found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it anymore.
