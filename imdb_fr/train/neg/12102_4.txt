This film is really ONLY the interpretation of Bill Maher's religion. There are many fun moments and interesting points, but do not go into this discussion while waiting for an unbiased discussion of religion. This is what I consider the worst kind of documentary: everything is arranged in advance and editing to give you the opinion of the director, instead of letting you make your own decision. <br /> <br /> EDITION - It's very hashed, interconnected with clips of pop culture and media to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before being interrupted by editing. The only people with a chance to speak are those who say what Bill Maher wants to tell them. Once someone deviated from the Gospel according to Maher, it was edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWEES - They are supposed to represent the most extreme extremist religions. From the evangelical television station to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to the TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously, A STOP TRUCK CHAPEL). He chose the worst money collectors, heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say no. And when he asks a good person to interview, he changes it. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Muslims are particularly affected. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting him, either himself or by correcting him with kamikazes. ALL Muslims are portrayed as armed extremists through assembly, and none of the interviewees are equitably harmed. <br /> <br /> ENDING - The final message is INCREDIBLE, hard and interesting. This idea is not presented with fairness to innumerable people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains that destruction clips play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> The film has some flaws, and the humor, although very unfair, is actually fun. But know that it is a very one-sided view, that of Bill Maher, of religion. He does not discover anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments, but heavy hand, with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
