Apart from the recognition of a beautiful cinematography, I can not say anything positive about this film. The real problem lies in the protagonist's dilemma: staying with his childhood friends in the world of misery or letting them live his life. The abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go hand in hand with this plot and, because of a bad set of actors, they also fail to create the desired atmosphere. The director only manages to present Anthony's dilemma and finally brings a simple solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, although it's hard to talk about characters ... except perhaps Sonny. Beside him, the actors do not play much and when some of them have to do it, they present themselves as amateurs having fun. I wonder what ruined the film the most: the superficial scenario, which throws all the potential of the plot, or the bad behavior, disturbing any call that might remain.
