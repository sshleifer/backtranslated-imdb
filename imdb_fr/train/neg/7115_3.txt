Okay, the introduction, with its hokey offer of a free coffin to everyone who is dying of fear during the movie, is so lame that it's funny. And so the first "skull scene" is so long and so exotic that it's funny. The plot of the movie is pretty decent, there is at least a bit of food for thought, and the plot is decent over horror movies. The acting is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> In total, this film does not fall flat like a 1/10 film. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest note or even the second lowest. If I just read the script, I would say there was a potential for it to be a decent movie. It's just that horrible direction and production ruining the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there are worse ones.
