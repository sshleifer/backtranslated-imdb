Inspired by a selfish novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald's friend and groupie, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck continues in an unscrupulous excess as an energetic, drunk-or-damned-alcoholic; in contradiction with the real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's era of Hollywood writing, this highly honored author lived a quiet life and effectively fought against alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to recycle his flapping stories in order to support his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (at the university). Living in a small apartment and driving a used Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different from that described in this movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually every 20th Century-Fox film produced under the leadership of Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as virtually every film made by Henry King, was a work of excellence. The beloved Infidel was the exception.
