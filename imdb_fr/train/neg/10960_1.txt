Ouch! They do not come much worse than this horrible adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. Although the adaptation is very faithful to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to that of a school play. I read that the budget allocated to this miniseries was the highest ever granted by the BBC at that time, but it surely could have collected a little more than the 2 dollars for which it was shot. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know the computer effects were not at the level needed or even profitable at the time, but the man in the costume shop was awful. Better to have cut the character of the film than to do it for the role! Avoid that at all costs.
