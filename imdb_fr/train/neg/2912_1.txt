"Meatball Machine" has to be one of the most ridiculous, terrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever seen. It is good against evil and a tale of arrival in the age, for the purpose of entertaining in a bloody, sordid and humorous context. Because of this, the violence is not particularly horrible and does not make you squirm, but free bleeding and nudity unfolds freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I've seen. If that were not enough, they are also made by a new director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This film has everything to please, it's bad for the bone !, Must see for all the crazy b-movie! ... Simply: a rare and pleasant jewel.
