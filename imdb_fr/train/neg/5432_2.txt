A battleship is sinking ... Its survivors, hung on a nearby life raft, sit idle while we talk to them in the head for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Coward is the only one you will notice in the credits, all that is cinematographic is due to Lean. And on the technical side, that's fine. David Lean just KNOW the movies right off the bat. Coward's studied dialogue occupies a second place and Lean's visual sense occupies a prominent place. Try the soldiers coming down from the ship towards the end and all this scene; the traveling towards the hymnals, the scene where we are in a house that is bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. It is totally wooden, not showing emotion, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what the other artist is saying, he's waiting for them to finish so he can get out his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <BR/> <br /> His episodic story, a little repetitive, and his flashbacks overwhelm the story: there is no central story in which they advance, but they give a general overview of the characters. It's still an interesting movie that deserves to be watched - and a good start for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's really a propaganda film, but it's also a showcase for Lean editing skills - it's all about how pieces are put together.
