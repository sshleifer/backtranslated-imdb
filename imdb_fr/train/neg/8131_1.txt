Unless the title is supposed to be a sort of spoiler for the transformation of the woman (the demons! The ruin for us). Any case, if this film was not designed for television, it should have been: its budget is remarkably low, it is underwritten, underused and it hits every 70 years, except the disco. Nobody is nice, and you could neglect what happens to anyone in this one. Extremely forgettable except for bad, bad performance.
