I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest, it was one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Do not get me wrong, there are the fun and funny bad movies (for example, "Manos ?? Hands of Fate"), then there are the terrible bad movies. (This one falls in the last category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a good way. It was as if the cameraman was deliberately guarding everything that was blurry (except for a free nipple shot), the lighting was something between "a guy running with a light bulb" and "non-existent" . The actors were as bad as the soap actors but not as bad as the porn actors, and gave the impression that each line was a total surprise for them. The only redeeming feature was the masked killer look, a classic look at the Jason Vorhees of "Friday the 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor and the end even worse. I would only recommend this film to anyone who needs an example showing how a horror movie is not supposed to look like or maybe an insomniac who needs sleep.
