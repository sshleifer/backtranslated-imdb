And I thought The Beach was bad, except that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrible scenario, if anyone can understand what the hell was the purpose of this movie, give yourself a pat on the back. It's a cross between The Village and a crappy scenario. It starts a little to get your attention, and then as it goes further in the plot, it makes no sense, and do not get me started! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is the usual good mood of Nicolas Cage and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. If you go into a blockbuster and it's the only movie to watch, save five dollars and go home and put something on fire. There you go!
