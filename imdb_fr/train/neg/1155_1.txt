Never before had a film led me to write a review, but it was just terrible. I was stuck trying to find out about this film that made Snoop take it as its first serious role, but frankly, it was a bad choice. made a good book, but it certainly did not work for me as a movie. by Dylan Mcdermott and Rose Byrne was passable but not enough to lead a weak plot with a weak dialogue. Maybe I missed the point, but for me, it does not fit into any genre, it does not cause any empathy with the characters and creates no suspense, in fact I ended up praying for the end and to suppress a deep desire to slap the three main characters!
