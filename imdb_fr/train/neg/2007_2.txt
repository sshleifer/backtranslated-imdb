The casting is OK. The script is sometimes awkward and it takes a while to understand the interest of the film. I found myself impatient to do the dishes. The Shehan is a cheeky statement about the war. I guess we were supposed not to notice ... we did it. It's a house, you've done nothing but kill forty-five minutes. The shower ... huh? What was it? Literally, it's me who has a client, "Ok, you can use our shower." Yawning. The angles are much too difficult. There was a set of woods, suddenly it's gone because you can see through, then it's deep and the animals are dying. In the end, it's a horrible movie of boring proportions.
