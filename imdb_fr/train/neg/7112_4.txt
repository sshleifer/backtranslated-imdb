Well, I have to admit it was one of my favorites as a child, when I watched it on a super 8 home projector. Now there is not much to recommend, except for intrinsic value inherent in the fact that actors are "terrified" by replicas of human skulls. The special effects are pretty stupid, consisting mainly of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But there is something to say about the sets. The large mansion in which it unfolds is rather terrifying, especially since it is largely unfurnished (probably for budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> But it inspires more laughter than shouting. Just try not to laugh when the woman (who shouts more than her share) enters the greenhouse and faces the ghost of her husband's ex-husband.
