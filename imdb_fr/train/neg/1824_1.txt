I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this film. In a word, it's boring. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, the role of loser Ben Stiller, more than exploited, or scenes not at all funny make this film an unforgettable memory. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends pathetically. I was very disappointed. I love the role of Ben Stiller. I liked it in most of his movies, the last one I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Besides High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What about School of Rock? Ooops, scary.
