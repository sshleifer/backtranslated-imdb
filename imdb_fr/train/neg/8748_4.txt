It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on geek buzzwords, but very naive about the business world. The Department of Justice would catch more big bodily giants if they did such na√Øve things to win. The real world of business is much more subtle and interesting, but equally sinister. I seriously doubt that ANY organism can kill someone directly. even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, and so on. This film must have been developed by garages, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
