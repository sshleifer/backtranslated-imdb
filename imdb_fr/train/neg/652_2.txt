I think it was an overrated shit PG-13! At least the performance of BRETANY SNOW was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some other teenagers in the prom as well as the main friends were not as convincing. The killer was so stupid and looked so stupid too. The dead were stupid, boring and completely non-native. The film was also very boring and very overrated. It was not at all suspensive, I almost fell asleep. This is another bad remake of PG-13, it's really a terrible IMO movie. The end was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall, the only good thing about this crappy festival is maybe BRETANY SNOW. I think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but other than that, it was a totally awful movie and a horrible remake. Well it's just my opinion. I gave him a 2/10.
