What is happening at RGV? It seems to be repeated in all the films. Is he short of creative ideas? If there is time, go to the back. We went to see the movie with great impatience - of course, not once, I imagined it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it would not, the promos said it all. But even then, I thought it would be a good treat for RGV. After all, is not he the same guy who ran Sathya and Company? Where is he? I have doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story because it is largely derived from the original. If you're dying to see this one, you'll be able to play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So, Veeru becomes Heero (how is this nerdy?), Suppose Heeru would not sound so good. Ajay Devgan is a real disaster for Heero, the comedy is tense and the confused speech that has really been effective in Company seems wrong. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more charming Nisha is, the more irritating she becomes. This peaks at the end. Raj is actually not bad compared to others, it's a type to watch in the future. I was really disappointed by Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something in a shawl-covered bowl, instead of inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha was the only performance that really stood out. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
