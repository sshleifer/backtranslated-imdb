Honestly, I went to see the film, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because it was ranked 17 here in Luxembourg and a film must be really brutal or pornographic to be classified in this category. Trust me, as a moviegoer, I've seen quite a few brutal movies of my life (Ichi the Killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen view. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid, the staging is awful, the acting was mediocre, even the music was an inexpensive copy of the so-called "horror soundtracks". There is not one intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some scenes are really hard to bear. (especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby crying - horrible). I do not understand why the film was ranked 16 in Germany, where the criteria are generally difficult (for example, kill-bill (brutal, but he made fun of himself and alluded to Asian cinema and a magnificent achievement) even a film as a state of grace is ranked 18). Nobody can call it a horror movie, because in reality, it was more about showing blood than scaring the audience (showing the face of "Creep" in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression), it's just a foolish director who lives his troubling fantasies. In some scenes, we see violence, it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and explains nothing. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, honestly I can not mention a single positive aspect of the film with the exception of the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would do it. Banish this movie from movie theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies have invested their money in this shit. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to getting feedback on myself and I would be happy to do so. discuss on one or the other subject. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, livin' the dream" by David Aames
