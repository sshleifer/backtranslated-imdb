This movie does not look like "Office Space" except in places. The office space was hilarious. I would not recommend this film to anyone because I did not laugh during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's complacent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's place to be able to leave if necessary.
