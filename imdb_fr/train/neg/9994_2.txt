Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, is stuck on a snowy mountain and has to face the difficult decision of eating the flesh of their dead companions to survive. Sound familiar? I'm referring to "Alive" from 1993. The only major difference here, of course, is that a frightened, white, and drunken raven, of a Yeti, comes up a few times to drag the dead. I guess humans taste better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Silly: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable gun when he hunts the Yeti, nor does he have any reinforcement. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely wrong. It would have either exploded in the air or exploded when it hit the ground or be erased. People would not have survived, but hey, it's science fiction. <br /> <br /> Silly: They have survived and they are cold. It might be a good idea to exploit some of the nearby burning debris so that you do not die of cold. The fire is hot as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot is covered in frost on his face while he is alive and talking, but curiously, no one else is doing it. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the guys tells the others to search for matches and lighters, but scattered parts of the plane are all around them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they find coats and hoodies, and yet it in the cold of the Himalayas, they do not use hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They fix a bunch of sticks when, I repeat, there are pieces of the plane ALREADY BURNING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are famous for their storms. It would make sense for them to collect debris to strengthen their structure rather than stay out of strife. There are many pines around, whose branches make excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use the arm of a dead man as a splint. <br /> <br /> WTF: If this guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears, and leopards in the Himalayas, why does he not know enough to take shelter and to install traps from the beginning? <br /> <br /> Silly: When you try to trap wild animals, a blind conversation around the trap always helps you. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how difficult it would be to cut a frozen oven? corpse with a burst of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two stood there defenseless. The Yeti tore off the man's heart and stomped on the girl's head. The gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So, two jeetis and a convenient avalanche to bury evidence forever ... or at least we think so. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more idiocy but most actions occur in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Think about the javelin and the chain, although it's ingenuity (with the magic-looking chain) that was missing at the beginning of the film when they could not even fire when they were all around. 'them. <As usual with Sci-Fi Originals, the loving couple kisses in the end, as if nothing had happened to them (not to mention that they had eaten human flesh and they did had not brushed their teeth for several days)). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is dirty.
