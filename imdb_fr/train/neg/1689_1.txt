Wow, what total dropped! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct scam from "The ring". The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion .. Just a bunch of flashy imagery. The whole movie was boring, stupid. I guess there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, it's the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And this Buffy girl? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented ... No, wait, it would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I guess a lot of kids helped this movie at the box office because it was PG-13, and it would have been rated R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!
