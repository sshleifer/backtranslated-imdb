Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as cool as ever. Ritter was not bad either. Her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. Too bad the plot is atrocious. It was totally predictable, banal and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was presented as a children's number painting routine. The characters were pieces of cardboard cut out. There was nothing new or interesting to say and it outweighed the acting, which was a shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, too bad that the screenwriter was not a victim. Especially with the "early" lines of the child, which were completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Again, only acting has prevented a much lower score.
