For a movie about a killer, it's surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on and even when events happen, they do not generate real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is good from the two main actors, Cassetti in particular offers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast is also doing what it needs. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the writing is mediocre and direction and the fact that in fact it is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is neither interesting nor exciting. <br /> <br /> This kind of film normally tries to generate tension, empathy or indignation and it generates nothing but a feeling of regret that you have wasted your time watching.
