I chose this one because the music was created by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix modular synths (created by someone who is dear to me). The jacket is marked "version 2003". <br /> <br /> I give her a point for a strong woman, a point for a sordid dialogue and a last point for Meg Foster's light blue eyes, among which shots. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum swim casually (the pool has a plexiglass window!), while his love was pursued by a psychopath in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were slightly impressive - that is, the homes of wealthy L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was located. I wondered how they could continue the cleaning with all the dust that blows. The wind was not strong enough to be credible to me. I kept thinking that the animal skins on the furniture must be nasty ... etc. and realized that the movie had to be pretty boring if I wondered these things when the supposed plot was going on. I came across such things as: why did she light a fire, extinguish the match, then throw the match in the fire ?! Foolish things like that. It was at best clumsy. Never mind. Robert Morely had a little fun with his geezer character and his beautiful vacation.
