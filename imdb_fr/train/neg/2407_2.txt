I watched this today, partly attracted by the cast of stars and partly because I enjoyed many other films like this. However, this is to be avoided. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where continuity is not created, the billiard challenge at the beginning, for example. The fight scenes with the natives are about as good as in the old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying in the air and where the camera cuts a dead native lying on the ground, motionless, who comes out of his thigh. Is it instant death? There are also several superfluous scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl saved while she picks up flowers. The clay toys really badly animated are too painful to watch. If you see this film, it's the crabs that advance at about 5 km / h. One way or another, we manage to approach David Mccullum and give him a brushstroke. It's as if there is no time to get off the path, as when the obelisk of the city falls, the native has all the time in the world to make a left footstep, but no, he screams and falls on it. him. I give only a 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums' voice create stuttering as the movie moves on?
