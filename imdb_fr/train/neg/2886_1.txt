Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, do not waste your money renting this movie. It's like a small budget for Canadian television. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many more. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. : (Is it possible to write ten lines?) The acting was awful, he had absolutely no flow, I saw the movie made for the TV movie about the killer of BTK and it was a lot better (in relation to this one) I'm not sure Of course, they wanted to know what they were looking for in the production of this film, but whether it was to educate us or to tell a story about the killer from BTK that they missed by far, it was rather an infomercial for animal rights.
