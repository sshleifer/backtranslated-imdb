This film basically talks about girls in a Catholic school who end up having trouble because of the red coloring in a fellow shampoo and after being scolded for this act, they decide to go on vacation to Florida. On their way, they meet guys in a local restaurant and decide that they will meet again later in another place. The girls end up on a roadside near the woods and stop for a moment. While one of the girls decides to walk around a bit, she sees a murder happening in which the local sheriff is involved. She is scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go see her and two of them are killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and placed in a local prison cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff watches the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the murderer, he ignores them and acts as an ignoramus and everyone in this movie that just can not put two and two even less for him. at this. The best part was the scene of rape between the murderer and one of the girls where he decided to rape her in her prison cell and it seems that the girl WANTS in reality to be raped by this man and that the scene of the bare chest be good, but before their lips meet, he has something else in mind. This film reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon, the same motive, but a different part of the character. It's not a film that's worth being praised, not even for a low-budget 1980s movie, and the end is the worst end I've ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting recover my money!
