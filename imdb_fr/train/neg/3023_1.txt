It's rare that I encounter such a horrible, annoying and irritating film. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it's not a confusing and unnecessary flashy editing blur, is ridiculous. Why has Domino become such a bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a child and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally stunted, and hated everyone. When the dialogue is neither clich√© nor banal, it is littered with ridiculous lines such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and all the others". At one point, bounty hunters have a guy attached to the back of their bus and wearing a tattooed suit number on their arm. Because of a confused phone call, instead of rolling up their sleeves and reading the number, they tear off his arm with a shotgun. At another time, the bounty hunters bring a bomb to an organized meeting with the mafia and threaten to set off the bomb if the mafia does not let them go !? Obviously, not going to the meeting would have been just too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terribly missed. Mickey Rourke manages to preserve some of the credibility of this mess. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance being one, but all I could think of in suffering from this drama was that it had to be done by a complete idiot.
