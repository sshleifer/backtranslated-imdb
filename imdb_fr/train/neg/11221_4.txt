Lolita is a rebel and she will share with our eyes wide open a few little stories of sex, between science fiction and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad game, horrible music and a story without any history and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well done, many lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good final show very hot. For Lovell fans only.
