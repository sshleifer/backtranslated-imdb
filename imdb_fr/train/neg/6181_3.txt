If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could interest you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I did not even know him. the existence of this movie until the eve of its release, when the advertising company panicked and covered Music Row with dozens of flyers and billboards. In any case, it barely lasted two weeks in the movie theaters. <br /> <br /> Bad interpretation, bad writing and poor production only describe this embarrassment of a film. For starters, the names are a little too much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> The delivery of Toby's clumsy lines is reminiscent of the production assistant stuck holding the camera's memory cards. Angel's character moves quickly from town to a cowgirl and slips into southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to Toby's feminine version. In fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, which makes us wonder if the assistant-wardrobe is sick. <br /> <br /> The sound is incoherent - The most striking example is perhaps where Toby decides to swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> The explanation or development of the character is never enough to suffice for what happens on the screen. Overwork, exasperation, grimaces and mood swings best describe the interpretation and direction given by the scenario to the appalling scenario. <br /> <br /> It is better to enjoy this movie after consuming some alcoholic beverages and in the company of your most spiritual friends. But it does not say much.
