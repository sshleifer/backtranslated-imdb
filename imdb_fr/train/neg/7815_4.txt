As a long time fan of Superman in comics, in the 1950s, the first two movies of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally in Smallville, I was really * hoping * something clever with "Superman Returns ". Instead, we asked Lex Luthor to * do * another * real estate conversion attempt, another kryptonite-beaten Superman sequence, and internal inconsistencies: he could not help but fall off the ocean when stuck with 6 "of kryptonite, but when Lois separates 3", * leaving the rest encased in it *, it can elevate * a continent * into space ?? In fact, the only hero in the story was Lois's partner - I can not remember her name. He did all kinds of heroic and saving things with nothing but courage and skill - no super powers, no invulnerability ... just a normal human being. <br /> <br /> They keep making Superman so small. Why can not we let Superman fight Brainiac or save General Zod's universe instead of Lex's plots? Oh, I forgot ... that's what they do in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... I think I'll stick to Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
