The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn make a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I pulled! I did not have anything! In the first half, there is a new character (without introduction) in all the other scenes. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is only a long scene of pursuit annoying and under-lit. There's always an irritating noise in the background, whether it's a ticking watch, a resounding siren, a whistling train or even the awful Quincy score Jones. There are many parts that are ridiculously bad, too. Like, the bad guys chasing Beatty on the thin ice with a car! Or, the police arrived on the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
