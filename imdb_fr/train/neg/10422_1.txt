First, I'm not easily scared by ... Just for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not appropriate for children at all! My mouth was open all the time it shocked me. I could not believe how bloody it was for a children's movie, rabbits being brutally murdered! It is simply useless to be so horrible and to be rated G. I recommend to be over 8 years old to see this. But do not get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I was not mentally marked in my childhood. I can not believe a parent would allow a 4 year old, say, to look at that. It's too intense and complicated, do not forget gore, for young children. I am over 4 years old and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
