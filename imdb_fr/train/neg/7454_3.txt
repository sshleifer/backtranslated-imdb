I really like casting, but the story unfolds slowly. Danny Glover does a good job and makes you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are only part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have the same place in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit depressing about how the story unfolded. I would still watch though. I rated it 5 (I would like to be able to give it a score of 5.5)
