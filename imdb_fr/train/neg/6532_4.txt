The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars has not been lost but is drifting into the near space of the planet. When he is found, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told by a flashback of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was allegedly attacked by a series of bug-eyed monsters. Oddly enough, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were some of the most idiotic I've seen in the movie. Moreover, in a strange attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just gave the film a cheap look at all when they were on the surface of Mars AND the intensity of the redness almost blew my eyes - it was THIS BAD !! In spite of all the cheeses, the film had a rather interesting plot and a good message about space travel. For fans of the genre, it's worth the detour. For others, you might find this rather silly: see for yourself and decide. While according to current standards, this film is not particularly good compared to the films in progress. at that moment, it sounds pretty good. <br /> <br /> PS - When watching the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like Dr. Quest's spitting image of the cartoon "Jonny Quest"! Plus, he sounds and behaves a lot like him too.
