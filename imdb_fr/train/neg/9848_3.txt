This film has some stunning blackish / neorealistic visuals, and tells a refreshing, sugar-free Hollywood-coating story, which was possible only because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some scenes last far too long (marriage, in particular) and I found that theatrical play and unrealistic dialogue were more suited to the scene than to the big screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly embarrassing and it seemed to get worse with the progression of the film. Most of the characters were Italian-American or Italian and lived in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded as if they were training for a Shakespeare play by mixing cement and bricks. Towards the end, I laughed, and not because the filmmakers wanted it. I suppose that poetry on stilts could be defended by saying that the characters would have spoken Italian, and that dialogue is a literal translation of the way they would actually speak. But that did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly takes on a beautiful British accent. I guess it has something to do with the fact that the film was shot in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an "A" for effort and intent, but a noticeably lower score for performance.
