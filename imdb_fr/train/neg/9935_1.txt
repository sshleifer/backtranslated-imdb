It makes me completely lose the reason why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a prime example of his incompetence as an "intellectual" filmmaker and polemicist. It is hard to believe that Godard really believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with a half-brain could work on the bankruptcy of these "isms" and the number of people they destroyed and continue to destroy, even as Godard made his films to support them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself the following question: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes to your audience, then, when you can not think of anything else, layer another voice-over at the first voice? off. had he lost his listeners after the first 100 words anyway? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did it; is not it? It was the only guarantee to see such stupid waste: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a political idiot without talent and talkative launched with a camera. The bookstore scene did not even deserve the worst marginal theater and was an insult to the intelligence even of the young children used to playing it - as it was easy to see. To abstain by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this na√Øve shit was a satire of traditional cinema is nothing more than a safe exit to offer to those who clearly see Godard's intellectual poverty and contempt arrogant for his audience. It is ironic that Truffaut, one of Godard's great friends, with Nuit Americain, directed the best film about the making of a film, and Godard realized the worst with Le Mepris! Moreover, Godard did not choose the track of Sympathy With the Devil of the Stones. This is the piece they were working on when the "film" started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
