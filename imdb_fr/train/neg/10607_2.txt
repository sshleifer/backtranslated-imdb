Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by producing the Universal Soldier suite. But, did this film save him? I think he goes to hell after his death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of an installation, where you can see the villain of the film. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the actor (details follow). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (do not remember her name ... well, it does not matter, anyway), trying to escape to muscular men. Of course, these are the new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg but the "mission" is abandoned. It was just a test (Is this film a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (which saw the first film may think that this is the most illogical thing that can do the character of Van Dammes). But it's a sequel. And a "story" must come. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for "history". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about stopping and giving up. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the premises BUT the computer sends soldiers to look for him (he wants Van Damme to be a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who has always been an idiotic phrase to the public before getting fucked. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After a "story", Van Damme tries to save his daughter (from his wife - the journalist of the first film). This is the final show where Van Damme is fighting the villain and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (see for yourself, it's too funny to tell). <br /> <br /> You'll find that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Do not look at him. But if you do, keep a sixpack with you!
