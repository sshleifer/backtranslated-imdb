When I was at the movie store the other day, I dropped Blonde and Blonder, but something about it seemed like a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people have mistreated Romy and Michelle even before seeing her, Blonde and Blonder may well be another secret treasure that has been left behind. But when I started looking at her: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was scared. On top of that, but what was considered the pinnacle of passion: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they did not age well at all and they play roles that I think were more intended for women supposed to be in their twenties, not in their forties. The story was downright bad and odious. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your stereotypical blonde far beyond the stupid. They do not have a clue what's going on in the world, it's really sad. But when girls are confused with murderers, cops tell their story and call girls' geniuses because of their "ignorance, bliss" attitude. They are ready to "hit" a guy and think they are just going to "give him a good time," but the real killer is checked and wants the deal and to kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam look very awkward on the screen and almost as if they had read the script the day before. I know it was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it became obnoxious and it was just useless. Would I ever recommend that? Not in a million years, girls are just trying to keep their status of "sex kittens", it's more a sign of despair and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1 / ten
