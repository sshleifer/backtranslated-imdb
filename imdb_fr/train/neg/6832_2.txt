I would have liked this film but Van Damme is just doing the same old old thing day after day. The combat pants are unfolding as usual. The only thing this loser has left out is that the Russians normally end up being killed. This film is quite made by a dog of the highest kind, please please please Van Damme get theater lessons, you need it. Everyone who loves Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way for Van Damme to play in an acting role is to co-write the film, produce it and play the piece for the film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND ITS NIGY WIG. I give this film a two out of ten, because the one with the sandman was better. To add insult to injury, I lost a pound on this manure
