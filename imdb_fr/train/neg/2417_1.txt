It was without a doubt the worst thing for which I spent money. I feel dirty for having confessed to having rented this "film" and paid money to see it. This does not even evaluate the waste. No no. It is the juice that accumulates in the bottom of industrial garbage trucks located in particularly nauseating areas after an extraordinarily wet summer. To call it waste is to degrade it everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to sign up for IMDb and warn my neighbor. This luvahire character says that this movie is awesome. We must question his understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director imagined that his audience would creak out at every sentence Ricky said, or alternately burst into uncontrollable laughter at times when most directors would want a darker response from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did a remarkable job. <br /> <br /> "I'm a budding actor myself who goes from theater to school and I had to play in a room where I had to cry and it was not easy to be moved in a scene then I give props to actors who have to make an emotional scene and who can make it happen. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Me too, I have to give props to the actors who can realize emotional scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look into another area of ​​work, if you think those laughs were successful. Nevertheless, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. Ha. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> "BRING THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would be missing you only on this commentary. <br /> <br /> I am too disgusted to continue. I will now give the film to my partner, Mr. Bangla. <br /> <br /> Hi! If you've continued reading until then, I guess you've already seen the movie and are now looking for one of two things in this commentary: 1) Another vitriolic degradation of what you've agreed to was an unusually movie poor. 2) An additional vitriolic degradation of what you consider to be a good cinematographic effort that must be defended against a foil as defamatory as me. Whether you want help to express your disgust or ammo for a moving repartee, if I say something positive, it will not disappoint - so let me assure you that the chances of such a disappointment are slim . <br /> <br /> The other negative comments on IMDb have already listed the particular flaws of the film (for example, the acting, the soundtrack, the production, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), but all these faults can easily be forgiven, in and of itself. Few people will rent a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they need these items to be first rate. The ultimate failure of "Hood", however, is his inability to keep the plentiful promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" is almost obvious to the video store with its implications of whimsical killers and cruelly creative murders. Here's a chance to mix the zombie movie's corny gore with the realism of life in the ghetto, to get gangster-thug zombies to bomb innocents while rock-do-hack, undead pimps Lice too deadly in their deceived rides. The mixture of both genres could have been hilarious. Instead, the movie is more like watching college kids play timidly the lines of a play they play, but do not understand. To prevent their video rental listeners from feeling betrayed, I suggest to the Quiroz brothers reissue the film with the new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: a homemade horror video that we shot in our movie". camcorder with friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored. "Or maybe they could publish it as a documentary." The day the creativity is dead - An exploration of how a low-budget movie may still be devoid of intelligent or original thinking despite the lack of links to a major film studio. "<br /> <br /> The potential tenant whose interest has not been stifled should find the following introductory text on the back of the video: "The Quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things that you can easily do yourself is not very interesting. "- Mr. Bangla
