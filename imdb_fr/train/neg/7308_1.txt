Liongate has yet to prove itself. Every Lionsgate movie was catastrophic. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they keep slapping me again and again. And Cabin Fever is certainly not an exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie. It was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> here is the plot. Guy cuts a dead dog for some reason. Is infected with the virus at random, transmits it to children in a camp, children start to become infected and die, the city discovers it and rather than helping them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> all the characters are completely late, you do not care about any of them and the kid should have gotten stuck with the boy meets the world. My friend and I discovered that talking about the fat and bitch of our only classmate was much more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We managed to go all the way by shouting $ @ t, because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> and I'm still confused by the random movements of idle karate from the only random child and how apparently everyone in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? why was the kid that the nipples were trying to kill sitting in a chair waiting for them to kill him? Was it part of the plan of the two? sensational. better plan ever. I can not believe this film had a theatrical release. I could hardly stand the DVD, let alone sit in a theater that does not move for an hour and a half. It was not scary, funny, cool, or anything. it's just a 90-minute loss that you could use for ... I do not know, planting a tree or something. it's more productive than this trash. The acting, the special effects and the script are a joke. never take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever has a leg shaving scene, out of 10
