This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. The game was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the film, she was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she rubbed her head with her lower lip stuck. She sobbed piteously without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost sorry to see that all the girls who wanted to be actresses had to separate her. Everyone was also suffering from over-action. It was downright irritating. It was also an insult to the figure skaters. Jordan took a month to train and they introduced her as someone on the Olympic team. It's practically spitting on the effort that true figure skaters put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. He does not even deserve a star.
