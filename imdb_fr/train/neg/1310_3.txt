The plot is simple: an old man who lives on a main road in the woods one day sees a man murder a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to convince the police that what he saw was not the product of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man guides the police to the scene of the murder, no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a tiny dialogue that reflects the majority of the film's scenes, an old man living alone in a house. During the film, I noticed that I was scared twice, especially when the murdered child suddenly appeared in front of the old man. I must admit that the rest of the film did not engage me; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after viewing the film, took too much time. I think we could have done more of the relationship, the ghostly encounters, the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night without being sure of your own mind can lead to disturbing situations, children are always scary like ghosts, see Dark Water.
