Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously tasteless "film" is like digging into your chest cavity with a rusty and salty spoon. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit predictable, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most shameful commercials I've ever seen. A boy who fights spies / terrorists when he is home alone in a Chicago suburb with chicken pox? Ridiculous! Why did this film have to be done? I am the kind of person who believes that even terrible movies are not wasted time, but rather learning experiences. However, it is actually a waste of time. It must be avoided at all costs.
