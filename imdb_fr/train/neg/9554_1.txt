It's the worst, and I mean THE worst computer movie I've ever seen. The plot as a whole is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy from this movie can talk with the computer as a real person. Now, you probably think it has to be a cool high-tech computer, well, that's right, but it also does it with other very poor and weak computers that do not even have a GUI. <br /> <br /> and the main idea is how to overload the computer "super" by connecting via a computer game on the net. My mobile phone turns off the lights to conserve energy, but apparently, this awesome computer can not decide to use its resources to deal with threats to national security or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also other problems but I do not have time for that. <br /> <br /> I can not believe anyone can record a movie as stupid as this one.
