This film was supposed to have represented a single boy who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not like his mission set in because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, no charisma. He should have at least had a way of taking care of himself that made weak ladies at the knees other than his saxophone, but to no avail. It's not because he's a musician that it's sexy. Not to mention the things he did to attract the attention of a married woman, he fell in love in the space of five minutes knowing it was absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Is this man any shame whatsoever? If he had cleaned up and stopped doing silly things, he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring. <br /> <br /> The character of Gina Gershon was unnecessarily British. She might as well have been an offside woman, stuck with her regular speaking voice, than a bad British accent that sometimes faded throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cherished were the fish and the frog. Now these two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both ?? STAT! Field holes, lack of character development, horrible acting, useless drama, clich√© moments ... What a mess movie.
