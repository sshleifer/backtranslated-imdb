I do not know why this movie seems to have received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I was bored by the absurd and random plot that was taking place on the screen. The film as a whole seems to be an insignificant and artistic self-indulgence exercise on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / scriptwriter has the same name only reinforces that sense of pretension. <br /> <br /> Those interested in independent films should rather look for something better written and dare I say, more entertaining than this total waste of time.
