No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material of "The House Next Door" from his 1970s novel of the same title, or if anyone else did it. This film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to try our luck when the film was featured on a wired version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, we do not find them in this version that we have watched. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that has thrown this viewer a curve due to the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. It was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the camera. This is true for the rest of the predominantly Canadian actors who deserved better. <br /> <br /> The film has the feeling of a cross between "Desperate Houswives" and "The Stepford Wives" and other more well-known features, associated with a light dose of goose bumps. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as a backdrop.
