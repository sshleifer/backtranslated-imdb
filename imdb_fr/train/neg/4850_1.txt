Some unrealistic spoilers are included. <br /> <br /> This film has been disappointing from the beginning, from real experiences. I am currently deployed on my second tour of Iraq as an infantry. This film has nothing to do with what would happen in real life. From the beginning, to name a few: the bomb tank, the EOD elements moving unescorted solo, the staff sergeant EOD sneaking VBC, the sleeves rolled up all the time in the ACU, up to the place where I had to call him, leave at my post. Haja copy of 2 dollars, the scene of the sniper. The list would continue, however, there is no need to list the errors that occur within 2 minutes before other items are incorrect; and the remark was made. <br /> <br /> This film is intended for critics and observers who do not understand or have any experience of deployments or the military. <br /> <br /> Those with a military background or who are familiar with the military will be disappointed by the inaccuracy.
