The biggest national success at Lampoon remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was funny, hoarse and in a good mood. <br /> <br /> The opposite of all other Lampoon films. Including "Meeting Class". <br /> <br /> PLEASE, do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") of "Animal House". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this disorder confused. This meeting is about as hilarious as the root canal and is twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star is generous. Again, I always thought that most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires, and serial killers.
