After listening to and appreciating Harvey Bernhard's Omen II commentary, I was shocked to discover that he was also behind this absolute waste. It's like a very bad TV movie you might see in the middle of the day when you have the flu and you're too sick to reach the remote control. I think that when Michael Lerner is confronted with what I can only describe as a Les Mis√©rables high school cast, my mouth was open, incredulous. And then my mouth went up and down because I laughed so much. Terrible. I do not know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I summed up my point, there is nothing clever in all this modern verbiage.
