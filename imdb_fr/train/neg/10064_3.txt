Pokemon the movie was a terrible movie. unlike the first, it's not a good movie at all. the graphics were correct but the story was flat and no real drama was built there. in the first case, the interaction between the characters was decent. the subtraction of brock and the addition of tracey were bad. Tracey really does not have much to say or do and unlike Brock, he offers no comic relief. the only advantage is that one sees hazy fun in front of the ashes, and that his first rumination about his nickname of his girlfriend was entertaining. Overall, this film is not worth renting and the short film previously did nothing for me or my wife. and we see ourselves as good pokemon.oh fans, maybe the next one will be better.canter a lot worse
