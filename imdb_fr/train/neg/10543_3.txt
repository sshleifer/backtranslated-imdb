The only thing that really matters to The First Power is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of his different varieties of psychotic villains that he has done so well in the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in these areas in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a rude film that Lou Diamond loses Phillips the detective role of LAPD who has a specialty in serial killer capture. Kober is his last catch, but Kober is in the league with a lower power and they will team up and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober receives the gas chamber, his spirit comes back in all sorts of forms. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is Lou's partner who knows a nasty ending involving a horse possessed by a demon and Tracy Griffith as a Psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with ideas are there to help Lou. Will he be able to fight forces beyond? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, it does not matter to you anymore. Lou is really trapped in a turkey. Maybe the devil made him do this movie.
