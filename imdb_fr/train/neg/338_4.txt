One of Eddie Murphy's most entertaining films is certainly this nonsense about a kidnapped mystic child, three hundred-year-old dragons and a "Chosen One". <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". A researcher of missing and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is "the chosen one" and that his destiny is to find and rescue "the golden child". For if the child dies, compassion will die with him, for he is the bearer. <br /> <br /> If all these crap do not ruin her for the moment, she will surely do it once the film begins. Suffice to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the entire film. Destined to be another vector of Murphy's selfish humor brand (comedy is not that great), the movie fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as a villain Sardo Numspa can not do much for the procedure. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
