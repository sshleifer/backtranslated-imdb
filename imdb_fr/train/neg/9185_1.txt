WOW! I did not know anyone would do this movie! it's horrible! I wrote 5 things that can say why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "it's the biggest rave of all time" where is this rave? I could only see a few people dancing in the area. <br /> <br /> 2. when they are on the rave, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, no world, two tents in ruins and a scene. and what are they doing! they drink! <br /> <br /> 3.the worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew .. awful! <br /> <br /> 4. when one of the people fires with a regular weapon, he fires almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone could fight as a pro! it must be something new .. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "It's going to be a great success, it's going to be a classic" .. of course you're stupid ** t anyway do not see this movie, it's a length of time. My eyes are still bleeding!
