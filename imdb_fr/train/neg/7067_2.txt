Five passengers from a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be cared for. But is there more in these nightmares than it seems? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment has the worst performances of actors, special effects, makeup and music. And these were supposed to scare? Hmm .. I think I was more panicked during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear that you would sit as if I was bored to tears while waiting for something interesting to happen. Do not bother yourself. It never does. In fact, I even stopped making quick shipments because they were much more entertaining than the main feature. AND the end is the ultimate evasion. Yes, none of this really happened. If only the same thing could be said for the day I was tuning my VCR to record these shoemakers.
