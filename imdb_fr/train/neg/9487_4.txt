The cast, although nothing special, does a good job, the story seems to be a good idea, the scenario is bearable and the end has a good turn; So, what's wrong? <br /> <br /> For starters, the special effects are really bad (if it was done in the 60s), it may sound right, but in 2003, there is no excuse for images too mediocre than these. . It makes me laugh that the DVD cover proudly claims "Jeepers Creepers special effects designer". <br /> <br /> Second, the direction is weak, this film does not capture the essence of the story, A doctor feed the souls of hospital inmates to the devil (or demon-like creature) should be tense or frightening; that's just not the case. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a rather mediocre film and, although bearable and sometimes slightly entertaining, it is better to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
