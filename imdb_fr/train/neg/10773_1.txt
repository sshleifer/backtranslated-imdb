I just watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, this is one of those movies you just watch to see how bad it can get. Frankly, I do not know how low the bar can be. <br /> <br /> The characters are composed of a lame stereo type after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the least. <br /> <br /> I have seen turkeys that are popular in my day, but there is no reason to list one since it is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that way, I watched the movie Vanilla Ice, because it was so bad that it was funny. This ... this ... is not even so good.
