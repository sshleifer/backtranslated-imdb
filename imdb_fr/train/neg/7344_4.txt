This is the story of a young woman seduced and abandoned by her oldest married lover after her pregnancy; she takes revenge against him and all his family, by black magic ?? which, disappointing, she does not do herself but has someone else to do for her. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror film. But the fade scenario never generates suspense, the director approaches the material in a completely conventional way and the final act loses the sympathy of the spectator for the victims by throwing logic in the wind. At some point, a character has an excellent opportunity to simply shoot the wicked, but instead, she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. Bad writing ?? you go there! <br /> <br /> Some harmful effects, such as a last-minute fetus dead body really dull and a guy dying to have received hundreds of live eels. Recommended only to genre lovers who simply need to see all horror movies produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
