In recent times, I have been subjected to both this film and "King Arthur", on DVDs chosen by others for a "show" in the evening. Together, they realize nothing more than to confirm the growing idea that the modern movie-watching public lacks discrimination, and is happy as long as they get "the action". Both films were garbage. <br /> <br /> What about character development? What happened to a meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And, when we look at something that vaguely claims to be "historical", whatever happens to try to capture a measure of precision, a realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of the time, even a slight scent of this era attitudes. Why do they all have to display all the values ​​of America in the 21st century? I read on bulletin boards disclaimers that "little was known" of the dark ages. Not so. Considerable amounts are known, with a lot of scholarly knowledge about the time, but these jokers simply could not be bothered to do their homework. <br /> <br /> I wish I could vote 0/10
