This film was a disaster from beginning to end. Interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as the performers themselves, are interspersed with representations of "the next generation of losers". This leaves little time for Leonard Cohen's own clips, which dominate all the other actors in the film with its imposing but sweet presence, wisdom and humor. The others are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as a prophet of the Old Testament. Many performances are forgotten overinterpretations (especially those of Rufus and Martha Wainright) or insignificant sub-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony are getting closer to Leonard's versions using some restraint. Stunning little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are scattered throughout the film - fuzzy overlays of red spheres on many concert and interview shots, blurry camera work, use of digital delay for some of Leonard Cohen's comments ( making it harder to hear what is being said) and a pretentious and scary low drone in many interview segments (an extra gravitas attempt?). For the real thing, see the documentary Songs From The Life Of produced by the BBC in 1988.
