Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who played a tiny role in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are deadly slugs in his small town. Note that this is not just any slug, but a carnivorous slaughter bigger than normal, mutated by toxic slugs (which always go as fast as a normal slug, which is not so scary, but I am moving away from the subject). Nobody will believe it at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> OK, Killer slugs are just above the psychotic lazy and just below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the goosefactor. So, the absurdity of all this is quite obvious from the start. The film is rather funny and is part of the variety "so bad that it is good". I appreciate that they explained that it was Slugs: the Movie, as opposed to Slugs: the children's game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy to watch it more than once and forget it quickly except to play a rather obscure quiz. The director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is more widely known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K just makes fun of) and "Peices" (which is probably the funniest film ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> <br /> My Note: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: a simply theatrical trailer for this film
