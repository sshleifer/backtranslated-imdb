Obviously, a lot of talented behind-the-scenes crew have been working on this film, so do not even look at the credits at the end, you'll prove them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this film, only 3 were at the theater; two fainted after 10 minutes and they are the lucky ones. The "monsters" were the unemployed worm of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected the designs of space creatures in Alien. The creators of the film obviously did not want to overshadow the third-class monsters, so they hired leading actors who, apparently, could not memorize their aftershocks or, in some cases, had learned to pronounce the words before beginning of the shoot. Some scenes are incredibly unable to convey what is supposed to happen, if any. If you are unhappy enough to be in a room where this movie is shown, and you do not lose consciousness, you will laugh at what is supposed to be scary or suspensive moments of the movie. The improbable character of several scenes will stun you, and the regular tale of "Queen Mary of the Curse" by Stephen Dorff reflects the feeling of all those who pay to see that. If you have to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait for it to be in the basket of good deals from the video store. If there is justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to praise you.
