This film has a principle very difficult to swallow, even by standards of this kind. We are asked to accept not only that a disc played backwards can bring a dead man back to life, but that it also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at a child, while the singer had no connection with the boy alive of course, no way to know at whose hands the disc would end. Anyway, the movie is fun for a while, but finally foolishness and futility reign supreme. If they really tried to create a new horror icon to Freddy, they were far from being null: the villain has no personality, no motivation, no variety. (* 1/2)
