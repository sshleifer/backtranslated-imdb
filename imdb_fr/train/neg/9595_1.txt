In the recent move to bring Asian films to America, this is the last film that should come out here. Being a big fan of Asian movies of all genres, I browsed the Internet and I came across this story before being reissued on the US market. So I decided to watch it in advance and rent it at a local video store. <Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely drained this film of water. Jet Li fell asleep watching the fight sequences. If you are looking for martial arts shows, your time would be better with a Jackie Chan movie !!! <br /> <br /> In addition ... you think to watch a martial art with about girl engulfed in revenge for the death of her parents BUT SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogues, a lack of action, the lack of development of a tangent plot, almost nothing to do with the principle to which we are exposed. This has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director does not devote time to Elbaorating, while devoting a part of the film that dragged on. It would have been a lot better if they'd just cut all that time and develop the story in itself through another movie and focus on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Speaking of that, I really do not believe Iron Monkey choreographer, did the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted by the frequent use of slow motion and rapid camera changes to portray the physical speed of the killers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please, I warn you not to waste your time and money with this movie. The postulate is exciting, and the trailer may even tempt you, but I am convinced that this film is NOT suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan but not in the United States) and will be the worst film reported in the United States of the Asian movie. industry.
