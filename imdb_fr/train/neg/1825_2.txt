I do not know what. I just could not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want to be a serious man about it. But I could not seriously laugh at this movie. It was just not funny for me. In some places, it seemed that Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. It's not because you have two very funny men together that it will be an excellent comedy. Some movies just should not be done. This is one of them. Because it's a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least somehow. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
