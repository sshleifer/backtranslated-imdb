I heard about White Noise for the first time when I saw TV advertising. Before that, I did not even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided to go see it. As a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. It contains Michael Keaton and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not deliver. He tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes and failed miserably. The beginnings are very promising, but the environment is slow to repeat and ends with a completely mediocre turn that any monkey could understand. Unfortunately, like most "scary" movies nowadays, the audience is overworked by loud noises and blows. This movie could have been a lot more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
