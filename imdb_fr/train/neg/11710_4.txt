There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not connected to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the series in this story of slow and extremely improbable revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film interprets Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to take revenge on his deceitful wife. Oh, but not by conventional means. She is planning a total guerrilla war and is recruiting the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as the weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (Tuesday) getting closer to her ex (the beautiful but dull Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to the music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his brief moments, and Anthony Dennison, the former star of "Crime Story", has practically nothing to do but scold. Hiltz, on the other hand, shows himself at various moments sexy and playful, then perverse and devious. It also manages vulnerable people and "maybe a little psychotic". She's also pretty hot (although there's no naughty show) so you can understand how she might be able to meet any guy for whom she's destined. But the performance is a little lost in this film, which is neither edgy enough nor interesting enough to recommend.
