Ye Lou's film, Purple Butterfly, pits a secret Purple Butterfly against Japanese forces torn apart by the war in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) are at the opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the commentator from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted and semi-historical plot for a plot, without giving the public a single reason to worry about the characters or their causes. The sudden change of weather does not help things because it seems completely unjustified and useless. Normally, dark movies do not bother me, but the lack of light, shaky camera images and generally bad shooting techniques make it hard to watch and stay interested. I also agree with the viewer. from Georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and a claustrophobic cinematography", but I do not think it helps the film. The film's backdrop is one of the most powerful events of the twentieth century, and I do not think you can do it justice by revising it like it's a Michael Bay movie. The melodramatic moments add nothing to its visibility. <br /> <br /> The actors are all melancholic. Zhang Ziyi shows once again that she has an exceptionally limited acting role, as she spends the whole film doing what she seems to do best in all her films, dark and generally annoyed. However, at least she adds variety to this role by singing chains and engaging in the worst dating scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> In the end, a very disappointing film, especially see how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
