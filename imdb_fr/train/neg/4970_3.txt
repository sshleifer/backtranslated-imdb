Good people, I came across this film in the evening while I filed papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the kind of honor it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I have seen and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of Sci-Fi corresponds to the version of Christopher Lambert. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did not I like? CGI for one. Incredibly bad. More importantly is the fidelity to the scenario, not to mention the game on stilts. I'm used to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Nice to meet you anyway, Peter
