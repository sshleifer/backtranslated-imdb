The film is a total shit. We have two good actors who are misinterpreted and a plow head of a Salman Khan actor just to attract the female audience. The story is a shit. The badly sketched characters. Count nonexistent. No editing strictly speaking. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... it's a dream in itself. The film hangs on the brink of decadence. The whole charade about the fact that Arjun brought his manna to London, letting his girlfriend fumble and letting him not play Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan is too painful to watch. I remember seeing good movies from this producer Vipul Shah but he's not one of them. It seems that all good directors are plagued by box office craziness. The media that the fools of Mumbai have created. It's still a crappy movie in the lines of "Wanted" with a silly actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a good Hindi cinema. He is good for Indian cinema as was Titanic for Winter Cruise Business. On a positive note, I like the Asin character who dances Bharatnatyam when she changes Western style when the teacher does not look.
