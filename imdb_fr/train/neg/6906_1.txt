Not only does this film have a mediocre conspiracy, a bad sense and a terrible acting, but it opens up a new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this film, the "white" girls are the sluts, the "white" boys are the gangsters of the wana-be, and who are successful (again) the businessmen " whites "are revolting the toilet blunders. script, only I did it on Caucasians. "It's really good to see you have stopped going out with these black girls." <br /> <br /> Nobody seems to notice it, but look again at this movie and you're going to throw up at the way they portrayed the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly, his whites, who are the main cause of aggression gangs and whores, attack quickly. Only Samoan girls have a heart, nothing like a non-slut white girl. <br /> <br /> It disgusts me to not be able to make this film without giving the Caucasian community of New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm going to generalize, go watch this movie and see what you do "white boys". Just because Samoans have chosen to call us "white boys" in real life does not mean it's funny. If I said hello, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
