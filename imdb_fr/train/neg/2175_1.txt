Carlos Mencia screamed continually, violently and with hatred "B ** ch!" in women, it's like shouting "N ** ger!" among blacks, except that it's worse. Remember that the word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative term that remains associated daily with violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or murdered. This guy perpetuates violence by hatefully using the language of violence. Looks like he's maybe a gay guy trying to cover up with women so he sounds like a straight guy. And how about all the Nazi Whites present in his audience who made the fascist greetings while their stupid little white women bimbo moaned in front of their eyes, terrified at the thought of protesting against this tidal wave of hatred. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support freedom of expression for THEM! Come on, Carlos ?? do you want women to have the freedom of speech to wax you as strong and strong and as strong as you, or do you think that "freedom of speech" is only for men who are cheating women ?? ?
