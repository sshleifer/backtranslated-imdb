I have not seen the original yet, but I just wanted to leave a note for anyone to scroll so far: Wicker Man is the worst film I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask for my money at the theater or go back to tell me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I will give him two positive signs of the head: the sarcasm of the Cage character has at least had some laughter from me and the landscape of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here are the jeers. The plot of the film is propelled only because the other characters will give no direct answer to Cage - and he accepts that !!! I do not know how it could last more than an hour of my time (a lot less days in the movie). <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How can anyone read this script and say, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to get an overview of what a movie should look like" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> N ' do not go see this movie, or even rent it on DVD.
