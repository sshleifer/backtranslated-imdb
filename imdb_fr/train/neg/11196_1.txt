My friends and I went out after 15 minutes and we were not the first. Then we tried to get our money back. The cinema management did not allow it, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: ex-Child Star. As you can see, this night was not memorable. Probably one of my worst movie nights. The second place should be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please do not see the Order.
