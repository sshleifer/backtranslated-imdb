This movie is just lame. A total loss of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√©s and the way he talks about RPG players is not funny either. The problem is that the writers do not seem to know how an RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a lot of losers who play the RPG as laggards and total losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story does not make sense. Who cares how long a game lasts? The biggest problem with this movie is that the writers and actors did not even try to figure out what role-playing games were about to make jokes. I was ashamed watching this lame movie.
