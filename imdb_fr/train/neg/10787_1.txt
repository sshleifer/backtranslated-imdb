Let me say it otherwise: bullets. Or, how about Bollo * ks. It's really awful, more embarrassing than those he tries to do satire. Julia Roberts is a talented actress and her work is generally of the highest level. This film lacks so much direction, even it is difficult to appear competent. Normally, she is the professional consummate, but I swear that in her eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved this gesture was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) to turn the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this theme has not been fully exploited. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was in wood, Cusack was Cusack and Crystal had to stay true to his role. The two talented former Buffy stars have had different experiences: Green desperately misunderstood and underused Balfour. Congratulations to Julia for almost preventing it from being the worst movie of all time.
