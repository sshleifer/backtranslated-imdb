After seeing the film, the first question that came to my mind was: Should it be irony or not? After reading a few comments on the character of Doc Savage and the comic book series, I knew this movie was not ironic. Thus, the story tells us about a super-American American doc saving a South American republic. It looks like a typical story. But this one is so unrealistic that it becomes ridiculous. The obligatory end of the fight shows the worst martial arts presentation I have ever seen. The film could be interesting for low-budget movie designers.
