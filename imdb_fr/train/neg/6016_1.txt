This film, released directly on video, should carry a warning label indicating that it is dangerous for human health and that the viewer may be bored. It's another thinly veiled religious film, evoking "kidnapping", with the good guys (believers) disappearing and the bad guys (the unbelievers) left behind. This is an interesting concept, especially as it happens on a flight ordered by a non-believer who has a sinful affair with an air hostess on board (needless to say that the sinner does not disappear no more!). Unfortunately, with all the non-believers pilots, the plane did not crash or the film was mercifully finished. Although it might have been interesting without the religious heaviness, as a whole, the heartbreaking film makes a gag, the acting is horrible and the simulations generated by computer are very fake. In addition, it is another film shot in Canada that pretends to be in New York. Spare me ... I'm just going to read the Bible.
