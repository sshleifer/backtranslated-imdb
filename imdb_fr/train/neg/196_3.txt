This film is defective on several fronts. Like many before, he describes the mythology of Alamo more than history. The production is mediocre, which gives the overall impression of a social protection project for many actors who would otherwise have had to work on Hollywood Squares. It was for me the biggest defect - I know the age and general personalities of the real protagonists of Alamo and all the geriatric television actors chosen to represent them, leave no trace of credibility to prevail . <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. I learned later later. I can accept a decent production from either point of view (although I prefer historical accuracy), but it has never given me a chance to appreciate it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this fucking mess, while being slightly less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
