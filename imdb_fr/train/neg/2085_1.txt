This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have the power to enjoy himself orally, I consider the film to be in the 14-year-old fantasy world. The bedroom scene was above and reduced an intimate moment to a farce of biological functions similar to the transmission of gas in public. From the start, every second scene was a discussion about how little sex they had, the time they had since, their next sexual relationship, and with whom. In addition to that, the dialogue and the acting were very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sordid sex scenes. It could have been really funny because the concept is interesting but poorly executed here. Please, do not even think about taking someone under 16 if you have to go see him.
