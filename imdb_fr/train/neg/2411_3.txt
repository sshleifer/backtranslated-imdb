Hood of the Living Dead tells the story of a young scientist, Rick, who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma, where drug traffickers and prostitutes invade the streets. Then one evening, Rick's brother gets shot by a gang that fought with him earlier in the street. Desperate, Rick calls his scientific partner to present him the last formula he works on, which improves the health of sick blood cells. The formula has not been tested on a human, or even on a dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. Rick calls the 911 and the body is carried away only to revive and enjoy human flesh. Now, Rick has to find his zombie brother before the whole hood turns into the death area. The hood of the undead is a garbage can. The plot is a direct scam of Resident Evil, the acting is horrible, especially with Rick's fake fake screaming for his brother, the weapons are so wrong, because every time the weapon is shot, it produces sparks and makeup is right. lame. It is only fake blood covering the actors' faces. Zombies are also modified. They run, grumble and have to be slaughtered in the heart to die! Zombies only have to fight, moan and have to be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible, the releases are the only real good time of this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a bit of entertainment here and there, but he only succeeds as a low-budget grin.
