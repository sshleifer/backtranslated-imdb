This is surely one of the worst films ever made and published by a big Hollywood studio. The plot is just stupid. The dialogue is written in clich√©s; For this reason, you can complete many sentences in the script. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The "choreography" is stupid and totally non-erotic. We can only regret the critic who saw the dance of Yvonne, 23 years old, sexual. it's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you like bad movies and like to laugh with some of the Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's thick makeup, when colored, gives her the appearance of a clown all the time. And she is the best part of this movie. What a way to embark on a career.
