This film is a total dog. I found myself exhausted to find something to laugh about, just to avoid feeling totally wasted my money and time. The writing in this film is absolutely terrible. It's a shame that it does not live up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They should have saved money on recruiting D list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spending that money for the script until it's used. was right. Even Gary Coleman has not been used wisely for his role. <br /> <br /> This film lets you ask what's the point of the plot - including the subplots. After watching this film, I had the impression that the producers were hoping to capture a kind of Neapolitan humor at the Dynamite, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the performance. Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
