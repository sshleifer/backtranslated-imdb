When I rented this car, I was hoping that "Reign of Fire" did not bring: a clash between modern technology and mythical beasts. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got a standard movie "Monster Hunts in Remote Buildings", with bad writing, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad action game. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a 2 is that in theory there could be worse films. In theory.....
