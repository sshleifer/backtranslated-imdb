I do not see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be science fiction). It's really fair "let's see what happens operationally this week" and oh, the Cylons are involved through flashbacks. <br /> <br /> The "baby" Cylon that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that T & A has been added to the series. Whenever she appears, I am puzzled by the WTF. And do not even try to tell me things about "history arcs". <br /> <br /> It's a soap opera with CGI. This is not science fiction apart from the basic principle. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that it has been worked on. If you like the photographic work connected, edgy, suspicious, nervous, vague on the editor, this show could be done for you. Since the nerds seem delirious for this series, this clearly indicates that the opinions of the vocal nerds have been changed relative to Picard's TNG.
