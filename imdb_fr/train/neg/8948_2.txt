'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and where nobody can trust. It's a very dark film and that will not make you feel good. It is a novel that takes place in this society, the betrayal of lovers and the egocentric human nature. The film has very good ideas and manages to portray this society with dark tones of color (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects, people and places. However, despite the film's ability to present this idea, the film was very slow and did not really seem to understand the idea. It seemed to spend too much time being smart rather than telling a story.
