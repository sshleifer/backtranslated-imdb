My friends can usually endure a lot of hopeless movies, but this one was too poor for us to watch. It was so boring and unoriginal. Even the "hot" girls who played in this movie could not keep me from watching. Everything was just predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The acting game was sometimes good ... but worse still. The most annoying character of any movie you want to die should be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break my screen. (you know what naughty and ugly kid I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot has been made so many times before I think they should be pursued by other movie companies. OK, it's a good idea, but that's all this movie had. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film can be viewed only if you wish, to preserve the abuse of your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
