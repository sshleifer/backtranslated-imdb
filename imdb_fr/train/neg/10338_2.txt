This movie is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Since the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer until the climax, the film is a predictability exercise in wood. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of crime fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who assemble pieces to solve the mystery, Hammer divides things to find the truth. This film turns Hammer into an idiot by surrounding him with villains who are ... well too stupid for nothing. One is so badly drawn that it succumbs to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film come straight out of the game book Three Stooges. Velda's dance at the helm, for example, or the villain who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the breaks of continuity are shameful: Frau Blucher runs along the axis of the road when the camera is tight on the bottom of her legs but she is on the side when the camera back to take a larger picture. The worst breaks, however, precede the popcorn attack. The naughty nagger Hammer passes a clock a few seconds after our hero, except that it shows that it was seven minutes behind us. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were interesting camera angles and lighting, as well as the grand finale. is so bad that you have to see it, which is the only reason he gets two out of 10 points.
