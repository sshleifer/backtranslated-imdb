Well, I can and will be very short. It's a poorly balanced, unconvincing film that could have been a little better. The script does not seem to know where to go ... from funny to serious clich√© ... it's a bit ridiculous. That plus the sentences that we heard before "the hacker is in Florida, or not, he is in Madrid, no he is in ... he is deceiving the signal". <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
