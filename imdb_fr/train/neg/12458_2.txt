The premise of this film is so simple and so obvious that only a Texan millionaire who emits a lot of oil smoke and whiskey would have trouble understanding it if someone shouted at the parking lot. In summary: the oil sector is tied to The Government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is associated with despots from the Middle East, and the CIA is a unique and devastating pool of "dual-purpose threads" willing to toe any line that comes their way. The only people who get caught are the good ones, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty created by globalization when bad multinationals invade the world in search of a tasty takeover or three. This really corresponds to the profiles of the wealthy authors of September 11th. <br /> <br /> In Syriana, this easy tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is waved in a loathsome vermicelli of twisted storylines, twist and turn through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor spectator is left alone with the conclusion that: <br /> <br /> 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be left near a camera <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt may know how to act, but they certainly do not know how to choose a script. <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a film about corporate and state corruption, check out Claude Chabrol's "Drunkenness of Power", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly played. <br /> <br /> A sententious piffle empty and loaded with misfortune spun on a disproportionate length.
