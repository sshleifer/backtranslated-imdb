Director Ron Atkins is crazy. This very small budget film tells a few days about the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a job that gets a Rubberneck doll from his slutty girlfriend. He begins to receive orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts out being a movie of the genre "it stays like that", but it becomes VERY repetitive, VERY fast. I lean more and more towards certifiable fools. It's hard to forget once seen though. A bit like Tom Green had already made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell becomes completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows her breasts and bush <br /> <br /> Candy circles: see John completely naked repeatedly
