The problem with calling "House of the Dead" the worst film of all time is that it really is not the case. There are worse movies out there. I watch a lot of Hong Kong ninja movies that are essentially the result of an unfinished Japanese crime drama, with images of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called "a movie". The Dead is however one of the worst movies I have ever seen in movie theaters. Leaving halfway, I felt a little dumber to have spent 45 minutes in this trash.
