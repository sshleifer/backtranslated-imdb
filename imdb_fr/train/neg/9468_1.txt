The only good thing about this tasteless dreck is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a student fails to find humor in something that was free, he is hopeless. <br /> <br /> An obsolete acting game and bad jokes can not be masked by a fantastic and bewildering scenery market the Volkswagon beetles). I do not know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing. It was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on Grinch's previous success (which has his opponents, but I enjoyed it a lot). It is hard not to miss this failure and wonder what better projects have been spent to fund it. <br /> <br /> Want a fun adaptation of Seuss? Go with the Grinch.
