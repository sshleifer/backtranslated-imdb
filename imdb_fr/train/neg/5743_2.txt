Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who want to trample this movie in the dust of oblivion. Let me tell you why I feel so. In truth, if it had been advertised as a zombie movie or something else, I might have liked it. But for now, I'm totally speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure What to mess up * Let's start with the first huge flaw. If I did not know that the movie is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and if I had not seen certain sequences where some people seem to suck blood, I would not have seen the link with the Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second negative point: what about metal? It seems that all young people, but mainly these so-called "vampires", are in various types of Metal, judging mainly by their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I'm in the most extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but no one is going to scare me by showing me ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all the bands !!!) T- t- running shirts, claiming to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT actors ?! You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Yes, all right, the movie is very bloody, but what difference does it make? That would have been a highlight and something to appreciate if the "brilliant" director had not chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL subject about the vampire in this film. I wanted to see some vampires, but I was treated to stupid-looking kids I'd love to use my baseball bat on. The filmmakers should have just announced the film saying "a horror class B cheap without intrigue but a lot of coolness"! <br /> <br /> This film is a blasphemy against the very concept of vampirism. And that makes me sick.
