I loved it when I was a child, but seeing it again more than 20 years later, it was really bad. Up The Academy may have been ahead of its time in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are much more resilient today than this smoldering wire. No T & A. No good jokes aside from the one-liners we've all heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the jewel I remembered. Well, I was far away! The soundtrack contained only 2 or 3 widely recognizable hits (not the great compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voices were terrible. For me, the only interesting thing was to predict the lines of the character before he said them. Yes, I watched a lot of movies at the time! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say so. :(
