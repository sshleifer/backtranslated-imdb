I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt to watch the entire movie without falling asleep. It's slow, and the idea of ​​a mid-Atlantic platform, which could have been revolutionary at the time, is now only a big cheer. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable and it's only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. When the water started to flow a lot, she even woke me up once. <br /> <br /> But give the man his due. Nobody could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not wedge it between his index and his middle finger like little mortals. He holds it between his fingers, while showing us the old pearly chestnuts. There are some scenes in this movie where the smoke rises to the sky on a dark background and looks very artistic. But he does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is tobacco smoke.
