An original image of poor Sci-Fi channel. A little uncomfortable, but not a lot. U.S.S.S. submarine with nuclear propulsion Jimmy Carter is on a mission beneath the icy, icy ice near the North Pole when attacked by giant, super-charged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has developed a way to communicate with the monsters, but does not have much luck for vague reasons. David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen are also part of the team. This movie could have been a little better if the eels / monsters were not so caricatural.
