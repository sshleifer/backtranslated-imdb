Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer who is trying to kill her at her prom. And in doing so, killing his family, his friends and his enemies. <br /> <br /> Before you begin, let me tell you that you're tired of the horror movies PG-13 that have not been scary lately. Are you tired of talking to a stupid girl "Oh my god" and talking about feminine things? And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then cry. And the last thing is that you're fed up with the American redesign of Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. That pretty much sums up the prom night, but I still have not finished the review. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The night of the ball" is to make laugh out loud. Otherwise, do not see the ball party. You never see murders, you only hear screaming and you see blood on the wall. And by the way, the dead are repeated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So, not only are they not scary, but it's odious. By the time I met the cast, I think I was ready to cast. Too many girls talk, too many guys, and a lot of 'Oh my God. This is our graduation party. I understand it's fun but it's really too much to ask not to focus. <br /> <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films, I would be also the first. I will not be surprised if the DVD comes out quickly and cheaply. Seriously, do not spend your money or your time on boring acting, cheap frights and a "night to die" when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 (PS if I could give the film zero stars I would like).
