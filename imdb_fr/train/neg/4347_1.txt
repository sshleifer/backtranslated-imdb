Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says it's in the late '60s ... which means Carlito would be about to go to jail. He was released in 75 years and said he was five years old. They used a group of actors, and a story that did not even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and play a different type. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican girl? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he had known him forever ... You would think he would have been in this one. And if that made sense, where are Rocco and the black guy in the first? It was just stupid ... It's an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
