I know, I know, "Plan 9 of Outer Space" is the worst film, or maybe "Manos, the hands of fate". But I can not get upset at these monkey-socks movies. Of course, they are bad. How could they be good? But if you're talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and a trustworthy talent, the T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl". All the sweetness of the voice, all that is absorbed by oneself, which stains all that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culminating point in this film. From his solitary horror summit, "Yentl" refers to "A star is born" and to "The mirror has two faces". There is nothing else like that. I would not want to speculate on the emotional feeling that led Streisand into filming this film. I can not imagine the audience she was addressing, although I bet there is a one in nine chance that you are not a member. Isaac Bashevis Singer, Nobel laureate and holy guardian of Yiddish literature, was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he emblazoned it in public. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity: not only did she not commit suicide, but she also made more horrible films.
