It's just awful, really horrible trash. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and make love. But while that can work in the mechanism of a porn movie? maybe even had a success as a porn movie ?? it tries to hide itself as a "movie" with real things to say, with real emotion and struggle. It's not. It's an excuse to put naked girls and have fun. I'm sure all of these women (and all men) in this movie could have behaved decisively in the 1970s porn film industry. . but not in the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> The acting game has been ridiculed, so bad that I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. I can not blame everything on these actors ?? they had nothing to work. The very broad structure or plot of the film could possibly be made and done well with good writers and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting at people from far away, like a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men not respecting their women enough. If there were more writing - better writing, better writing - and fewer free sexual images, we could have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This film should have been shot, created and marketed forever; he would have made more money. It's practically a hardcore porn movie already, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've seen that shows an erect penis.
