Schlocky horror movies from the 70s ... you must love them. Unlike today's boring slasher films, these special K-tel shows do something scary and do not use a tired formula. <br /> <br /> It's a B-movie about making a B movie has gone horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Land) is a B cinema queen on the hill who makes a film about a series of horrendous murders that have hit a family in their home. His boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with a positive attitude, is filming on site and on tight deadlines. The co-star of the Ken doll discovers a book of Tibetan songs in which she adds to the "realism" scenario. Unfortunately, they could have done without "realism". <br /> <br /> John Carradine, who had long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now lives a humble existence as the guardian of goods. He goes to his daily work, but still seems to run up against the director. <br /> <br /> The horror is slowly building; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave, eventually leading to seven murders, yes seven. (There is at least the truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that one film had been shot above him. How could poor Faith know that these sacred Tibetan songs would really work? Face to face, you can no longer just pull Satan's cloak and wait for you to take him down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to do an autopsy of The House of Seven Corpses.
