Trying to design something as tasteless as THE SENTINEL would be quite difficult. The problems are numerous. The result is terrible and full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who "took one" for Reagan during the attack. Years later, we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly as the guardian of the first lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement in the First Lady and a sudden threat to the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete failed a polygraph test, investigator David Breckinridge named him a disgruntled agent (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 television series). <br /> <br /> As the plot of presidential assassination unfolds, Pete is on his own people's flight. Her only confidante is the first lady and she is reluctant to talk to each other about their affections (which is why Pete first failed the polygraph). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to save time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent an assassination attempt by fleeing the secret service? <br /> <br /> The only big problem with this film is that there is no justification for the reason of the presidential threat. Is not that what the movie is supposed to be? We could think so! But the public never understands why the killers want to kill the Prez. Hmm. Someone forgot to put that in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what about David Breckinridge's new partner (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It looks like she was put in the movie strictly as a piece of $$ - candy. What was his purpose again? Did she do anything other than look great in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with the basic principle of The Sentinel that it is laughable to be so. The action is too easily thwarted by the "What is ...?" sure answers from those who have the misfortune to watch the film.
