This film showed more racial hatred of David Mamet's Jews than I ever met in an American film. The stereotypes are so extreme that my ability to keep watching is dead. I was so disappointed by Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna calling a group of men sitting in a Jewish center in New York cleaning weapons, heroes that common sense had won and I stopped. I am deeply troubled <br /> <br /> by the idea that Jews are not Americans and are "different". I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred and not a healer of the same thing.
