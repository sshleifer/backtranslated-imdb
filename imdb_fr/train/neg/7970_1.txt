Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching it depends on how you like your horror movies. If you love them so much that you're horrible, they're hysterical, look. Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I say that as a fan of the budget / horror genre on a budget and compare it to . I will not even go into the details of what made this movie was bad, but the only good thing is that it's so bad that it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen seen for years. If you can find that cheap rent, it's definitely worth watching, if you have been involved in doing it - shame on you. : o) IMDb must introduce a 0/10 rating especially for this movie, it deserves it amply.
