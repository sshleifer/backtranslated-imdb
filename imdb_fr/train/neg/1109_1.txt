It's almost certainly the worst western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is particularly common in martial arts and western movies - the hero learns that his family / friends have been murdered. arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated execution you've ever seen. The script is atrociously simple and insulting; it sounds like a high school student wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes seems doubled. Cinematography is lame and the decorations are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; Of course, some interpreters might blame the script, but others can not use this excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert again in a speaking role; every time he says a line that should be angry or nasty, he does nothing more than lower the tone of his voice and he sounds like a kid trying to behave like a macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, look at his failures (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look like Roy Rogers more than a dirty, dirty cowboy. . If you like a foolish movie fare that only serves to venerate the imaginary grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get it. But if you have more than two neurons, observe something else.
