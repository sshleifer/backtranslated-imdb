What was the purpose of this film? I suggest that the goal was to make sure that a few actors and their producers and directors got a big salary for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring movie. An ex-pugilist braindead falls with a strange woman and her relatives. He began as a restorative man for the woman and ended up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping program. It was so confusing that I can not even write a decent review. If you see this one, my sweet, make sure it's after dark so you can go straight to sleep.
