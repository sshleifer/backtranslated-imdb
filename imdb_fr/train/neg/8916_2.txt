I rented this DVD after seeing it looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and I liked it. I actually admire the work of Yalom in general. (I am a clinical psychologist.) I watched maybe 30 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. I'm not sure I can take much more. On a superficial level, the false accents, as others have mentioned, are simply embarrassing at best, irritating and on the contrary null. The acting is dull when he should be passionate and comical when he should be serious. Lou Salome's portrait is simply flippant, and the brilliant Freud is little more than a schoolboy. I see very little of the spirit of the book conveyed so far. I hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I'll send them back to the book. Imagine that.
