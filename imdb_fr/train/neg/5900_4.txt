The Japanese, young and attractive, are again on the wrong side of a curse, this time with mobile phones. Various people die until the unhappy spirit behind all this is revealed. If you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror movies, you can trace this movie in the dark, with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> The attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Until then, I was more impressed by his understated works such as City of Lost Souls. However, One One Missed Call was advancing, I longed for its more famous Dead or Alive envelope or the excessively pseudo-Cronenberg audition style. Despite the fact that many of his films are essentially empty, at least they have merits like that, or at least something that catches your attention, like Tadanobu Asano rearing up in shiny costumes imitating Johnny Depp. There is none of this in One Missed Call; there is just very little credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing in all honesty) in terms of fear or suspense, and in some places it's just annoying . <br /> <br /> However, there are times when Miike's sense of humor, like that of a glacier, seeps into bland commercialism; especially with the example of the television show aimed to film the disappearance of a cursed subject, and the television programmer more concerned about its ratings as the lives of girls. But aside from that, there is nothing to suggest that it's Miike behind the camera; his usual visual flair disappeared without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it is more likely that he has no enthusiasm for the project and I can understand why. A missed call is not offensive. It's just frustrating. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously likes to lead. With its huge annual production, it is obvious that it will not be 100% concerned with all its projects. Even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt like paying the bills.
