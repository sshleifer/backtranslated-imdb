It's literally the worst film I've ever seen in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good. this film is so bad that it passes a pleasant camp and becomes simply awful. It's the anti-enantiodrome. We bought it with the intention of heckling and all my family gathered for a fun evening of intelligent remarks; instead, we sat in stunned silence and pity poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> It's worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the sequels of the matrix. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than a Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Do not let this film come close to ten feet from your television.
