I went to this film while waiting for a concise film about the effect of Sam's Son on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me to feed myself because of racial tensions, popular justice or the inability of the average citizen to make a choice under pressure from peers. Lee presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective if it was in a 90-minute format with more focus, less side-tones. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother renting the video unless you enjoy Spike Lee passionately; in such a case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escape movie.
