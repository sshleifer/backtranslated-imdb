SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas plays his usual role as a tough guy and handsome boy, and his future real life, Kathleen Kinmont, is kicking Alexa's ass. OJ Simpson is a detective walking around in his awesome public figure since gone. Translation: cable TV charging. There is not enough skin to call it guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has gaping holes. Best / Worst Moment: In a discordant scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ answers that some of the bodies are hot enough, or words to that effect. This vague reference to necrophilia is sufficiently shocking; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film, it is really appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional and horrible way. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now, it's a guilty pleasure. Before Christ
