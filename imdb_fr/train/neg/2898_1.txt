Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, I finally finished watching this awful movie !!! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes, but I figured I was going to give him a chance, because it only remained to improve. Or at least have redemptive qualities, as I thought at least it would be a movie of the kind to make think, or really very intelligent, or very well filmed or something like that ... Needless to say, it was not the case and I lost about an hour and a half of my life. I will not even go into why it's terrible because it's a waste of time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and grant greater Be careful that noticing them movies and comments are not paid for writing good reviews or involved in the movie or something like that. I thought it would be funny after this terrible movie to see what rating it would get and I was very shocked to see the odds high enough ... all ratings of about 7 to 10 stars must clearly match DIFFERENT COMPLEMENTS film ... I'm still a big fan of IMDb, but seriously rethink this evaluation process because this movie should not be ranked higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.
