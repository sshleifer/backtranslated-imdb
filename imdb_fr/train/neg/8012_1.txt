As a lesbian, I'm always looking for gays and lesbians movies. However, with that kind of bullshit - that would be enough to discourage everyone. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to develop, or just for her. to have a meaning. None occurred. It was just scenes without meaning, without any connection to anything. The film gave no story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After at least an hour of this nonsense, I simply disabled it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time. your time on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and she does not even deserve that.
