This film was nil. The acting was nil, the script was nil and the whole movie was nil. There were two sons in the film who were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it needs to be clarified, but you suddenly notice that things are happening and are being said as if you have any clue as to what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> The heroine's negative comments about her. One never shows the public how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is related to the death of his fiance. The viewer also has minimal exposure to the guy's death. <br /> <br /> In addition, suddenly, a scene with a band of guys loading and arming machine guns is all you see before reducing to other scenes. No explanation of weapons and the people who accompany them. <br /> <br /> We gave them a 3 because we did not feel like coming back. It was fun to watch the movie bad mouth, so it gave us at least some entertainment. ;-)
