This is not art, it is urban propaganda and politically correct! Jindabyne's political intolerance is unforgivable ... she does not consider people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most offensive Australian film of all time (and it's up) against a pretty stiff competition!). A message film, every tired theme loved from the wired left is there: the aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are probably depressed. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, naturally) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. It is a strange decision taken with almost no discussion, as if the men were animals. The only man who briefly scrambled is the gift ... we know it because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby - and eventually settles in a more popular coastal location (far from all these people noisy bush). <br /> <br /> It's a movie made by these trendy city dwellers who live in fear of the Australian landscape and by these diabolic rednecks who live there. His ignorance of life in the country is almost as shocking as his scorn. The film is shot through long views of the bush, accompanied by mysterious and threatening music. In the end, it is very clear that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape. It ends with an extremely unlikely scene of black-white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, country life is no more than a backdrop for a story that implicitly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of the enlightened left-wing city. inhabitants over those of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This film was not shot by people with real jobs, but funded by the government Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the artistic series, this soulless void populated by beautiful people for whom lavish government funding supports these offensive projects (which are as far removed as possible from real life), as opposed to the making of popular films that people want to see. It does not matter if the film is a drug, they are always paid. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, avoid it like the plague. Social comment more jaded entertainment, this film deserves to pan!
