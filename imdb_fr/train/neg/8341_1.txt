I like horror movies. I can even enjoy most cheeses (9 out of 10 horror movies today are cheeses), but that was ridiculous. A dreadful actor's act, a terrible writing, completely hollow characters and incredible (no Meisner actor here!) And a total insufficiency in terms of number of people. I wish I could save the 79 minutes of my life that I just lost. At least the Crook brothers are aptly named. The only good thing about the whole movie was to watch Alicia Silverstone wanting to be hit in the fist. How was it ever done at Sundance completely baffled me? Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by slasher film standards. I mean, come on! Who would rush to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a harassing stalker guy comes off the door? Lame.
