Normally, I have a lot more to do with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour recording with IMDb, just to get rid of my chest. <br /> <br /> You think well. a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet ... well, this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy but Justin Timberlake did not let me do it. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stick to the music, what a dreadful performance - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can not blame Justin: the film is also devoted to intrigue and a badly chosen montage; it's definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan read the script before taking the game. Did he not see how poor it was? What could then motivate him to play this role? Money? Of course, playing is sometimes more a question of who you are than developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He spends much more time on the screen than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really has trouble understanding the mediocre scenario. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience says, "What the heck is going on here, you expect me to believe that shit?" <br /> <br /> In short, apart from Justin, a very good alignment executed - very disappointing.
