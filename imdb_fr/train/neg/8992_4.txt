It's a decent business, but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a little in the dark as to what makes a zombie movie really cool. No, they are not CGI bugs and software vendors. In fact, I'm not sure it's a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they were talking about. Anyway, I meant - instead of wasting your time animating a silly bug, why not add more zombies and more action. 2/3 of 20 minutes consist of newsletters, bugs, guys shouting for something. And to make matters worse (more boring), most deaths occur off-screen. I realize that it's too common for non-budget films, but then there were very impressive effects (well, kind, kind of) that left me wondering why the director (or the scriptwriter) important) has chosen to focus on the beginning of the epidemic. - It's short, anyway, no one will care.
