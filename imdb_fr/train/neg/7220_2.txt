Where do they get the money to make movies like this? I mean, nothing buys this movie. None of the actors are known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurred, the story oscillates between a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is incredible. For someone watching all kinds of movies, good or bad, I have to admit that this movie is the worst I've seen since Attack of the Eye People in the 50s. I do not really like to criticize the efforts of those who try to create entertainment or works of art, but this film does not seem to please anyone. The story looks at a mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul-eater, although it works more like a male succubus without sexual connotations. The bad guys have to team up with the gentiles in a city where they can not escape. Take it from there because, alas, it's the best part. My advice is that unless you're in the wrong mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and tedious sets, you'll be better served by leaving it on the shelf when you rent videos.
