I do not know if I'm referring to those who have called this video nasty video or the director ... "Devil Hunter" is a strange film "horror". <br /> <br /> The plot is a wacky combination of high quality movies like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". Chick is kidnapped in the "jungle" by a "tribe" of "savages". The jungle is more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who wander around in tribal costume renderings of Party City-inspired Halloween costumes. And the savages are white to Asian, black to Hispanic. I guess Franco just caught those who seemed even slightly ethnic for this adventure. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie has an ultra-minimal gore, no real fright and a lot of useless penis. Not funny. I can find something to like in almost every shabby Italian or European movie. It has just fallen. <br /> <br /> 2 children out of 10, children.
