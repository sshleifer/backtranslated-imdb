I usually like movies like this one. It's a documentary style, but the acting and writing are terrible. The acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is so clich√©, but not at all in a good way. At the moment of typing this, I am surprised that it is a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure most of these votes must come from parents of people in the film. I guess if that's the case, you might laugh a bit, because it's always funny to see your parents / friends make a movie. In a way, I suppose that gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc. to come, because if they can, they can do it. Although maybe you should not.
