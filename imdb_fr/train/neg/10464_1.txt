This film is not based on the Bible. This leaves Christ completely outside the film. They do not show the rapture or second coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it. He does not quote the scriptures. The end of time is called the great tribulation. The film does not even show the bad times. The seven cups, the seven viles and the seven trumpets of judgments boil down to a 15-second news bulletin about the changing sea of ​​structure. The Antichrist was killed three and a half years after the tribulation and that is how the film ended. The only thing they understood was that there were two prophets. Of course, they did not use their names because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to bring unsaved people there. I feel that the movie is diabolical. It's a counterfeit like everything the devil does. I just hope this will not take away the next movie based on the books left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor development of characters. I saw better episodes of Vice Miami.
