evaluate it. <br /> <br /> entertainment: a trash script that has been typed a thousand times in front of typewriters in front of typewriters. a pathetic game thwarted by history ... a satisfactory production value, even good set / rental and gorgeous girl .. -Rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the film has no social message. it's free ... but if I pretend to be 10 years old and my IQ 70. I think the message is: do not be afraid to love? -Rating 0/10 <br /> <br /> wrong things: nothing special, just the sweet hedonic and arrogant Jewish attitude presented by the screenwriter / director. in general, good, nothing degenerates -8/10 <br /> <br /> overall rating: 4/10
