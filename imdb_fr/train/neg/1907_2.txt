This horrible piece of trash manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, while being terribly chic and sophisticated. Terrible performances, a clich√© scenario and a boring direction make this film a place to avoid. Two scenes were particularly shocking: the one in which Schaech rubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (that could have been so serious), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who claims to be Russian. After leaving the room, she exclaims "f ** king foreigners"! So much for his cultural artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on screen and he's incredibly handsome. It's a shame that he did not learn more by working with top gay director Gregg Araki on a previous movie and trying to avoid this film from sinking into a series of gay stereotypes and a quagmire of homophobia. .
