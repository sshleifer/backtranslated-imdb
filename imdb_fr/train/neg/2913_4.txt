It is of course very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry. However, I was expecting something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting from the screenplay, which, in my opinion, was not a wise writing. in particular, the nerdy character of the dialogues, which put the audience in a position that, as if they were not intelligent enough to understand the situations, makes the film unbearable most of the time. it also has an obvious end; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. The weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility for patients with serious mental illness to act like normal people, like professionals right now !!! The medical terms that even normal people can not use, including in the scene where the staff was looking for the most dangerous patient, unarmed to protect themselves, were another strange point in the film. and this scene was so appropriate for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not the only weak parts of the film. there was also a lot of preciousness in the film. The representation of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, and the appearance of Togan at the very end is obviously the worst mistake he could have made in his first film! the fuss over the size of the film and the interviews the actor has given have just made people curious and force them to see him. Gen is a total disappointment. I wonder if, if Sahan was not so famous, would Togan be able to shoot this film with so much budget? I hope that Togan will understand that it is not fashionable to play a role of director, as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan pursued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not yet Hitchcock nor Shyamalan !!!! hoping he'll be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!
