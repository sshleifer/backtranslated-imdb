Someone could probably do an excellent documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version simply manages to drain all that is authentic and interesting from the phenomenon of trash-TV. There are dozens of famous films (for example, "Manos: the hands of fate") that show more creativity and wit than this waste, this waste of movies without wit. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not create a documentary about Jerry Springer Show, it would begin to answer some of the real questions such as: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How was the mayor of Cincinatti here? <br /> <br /> A good phrase: during a session "orientation" for guests: "People, I can not emphasize this point too: NO ARMS!"
