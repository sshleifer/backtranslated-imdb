I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority. I found the last issue of Spike Lee a bit boring! Even if he tried something different, that is, not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> There are really too many things happening - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's relationship (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's lifestyle (Adrien Brody), then the local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end, that's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, could not Mr. Lee have said more about this side of the film? > <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. All scenes with David Berkowitz, the killer of "Son of Sam", are very beautiful (saturation of colors, etc.) and the acting is quite satisfying. <br /> <br /> Overall, I had the impression that the different stories would have worked well alone or without the killings. It just was not strong enough at the end. <br /> <br />
