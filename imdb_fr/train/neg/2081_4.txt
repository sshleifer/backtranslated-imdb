This film is broadcast over and over again on the cable, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these 2 pretty women to argue about Luke Wilson or the "bad guy", just as tasteless, in this film. The actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I guess it's "funny" that Luke has an even uglier friend / dorkier / stupid, but hey, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the two women leaders would ever, ever speak to any of the men in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is that they sob, cry, fight, et cetera, against two types that have been best described on Friday the 13th 13. Dead * @ @ $ #
