I understand what this film was trying to portray. As older people are often ignored and treated as an embarrassment, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I do not have a problem with this message, but I feel that it could have been presented in a way that is not so painful to watch. I appreciate a good art film, but when a film becomes too artistic (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Including snapshots of a person slowly packing a suitcase and taking 5 minutes, try to make a point understand but end up annoying the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to tell them to put them together. It's a film that you feel you have to appreciate or give a high score and that certainly has its merits, but I was too frustrated to watch it to recommend it to someone else. The message could be deeper than other Roger Michell films (eg "Notting Hill"), but at least it was a movie you could enjoy watching.
