This film was by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I do not even joke. It was badly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have made ourselves. The case in which the film is entered is certainly a disguise. Nothing in the movie is like the zombie in the front of the case. It seems that the director or makeup artist just put a pencil in front of someone and call them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the film occupy nearly 20 minutes of the film. Watching the credits was the best part of the movie. Honestly, it was a horrible film and I could not believe how badly it had been organized. The scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes it was like "What's going on?" The audio was awful and the action scenes looked like two teenagers making fun of doing a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting or buying this film, I advise you to watch at least the trailer because it shows how horrible it is. I would have liked to look at it before renting it.
