I had never heard of this one before he appeared on cable TV. This is very typical of the science fiction of the late 50s: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is rather presented in a documentary style - which may be an inexpensive way to leave much of the exposure to the narrative and an excuse to insert as many archive footage as it is humanly possible. for what is undoubtedly a company with a very small budget! Although not uninteresting in itself (the apocalyptic angle via renegade missile later used, with much more confidence, both for Dr .. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and fortunately to be short, the film's resolute approach to its subject causes a lot of unintentional laughter - especially in scenes involving imminent childbirth and a gang of delinquent juvenile delinquents!
