I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before I went to work. If you want to see Dean Cain dive and avoid igniting you at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that does not interest you, well, I'm afraid you want YOU to be the one who is about to be burned, because this movie is pretty bad. The acting game, to begin with, is awful, awful, awful. The characters are all completely obnoxious, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade Sci-Fi movie. Towards the end, the movie started to make me think of 'Hollow Man' (with escape via the elevator shaft), except with a Dragon, not a naked and invisible man. Unlike other similar movies, however, this one was not even terribly bad ... it was just bad.
