was somehow enjoying this movie until the issue of Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any details of the plot - one afternoon, he wore a light beard, but that very evening the beard was gone and a very lush mustache was in place. It was much fuller than the mustache that accompanied the beard. Later, on a dark night in the open air, the mustache was gone and he seemed to be cleaning up his haven of peace. It was an opportunity to stop shaving would not be an option. These divergences of continuity completely distracted me from the rest of the film and ruined any credibility he had before. In addition, I found that the long scene of the cowboy alone in his room reminded De Niro too much in Taxi Driver. Even if it was a homage, it was too heavy for this spectator.
