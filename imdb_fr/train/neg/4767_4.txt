I watched this movie while I loved the plot, a group of strangers is held prisoner to try to understand how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The setting and places are obviously influenced by the first (and the best) Given the movie and although there is not much action, the story is moving at a relatively quick. <br /> <br /> There was a comic relief in the form of the two "alpha males" bickering and c me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart has not yet given up her role. <br /> <br /> Some things have let him down personally; 1. The pedophile was so characterized that he was excited by everything from children to corpses. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's reply about his ex-policeman "putting her in this" when in fact he was the least deserving person, he had NO KNOW contributed to the events which led to their capture. . The end ..... what kind of movie ends in the middle of something? There was no resolution, no cliffshed, no obvious end ... it just ended. <br /> <br /> And just for that, I dropped two stars of my note. The first 2 points I would let slip but not the end!
