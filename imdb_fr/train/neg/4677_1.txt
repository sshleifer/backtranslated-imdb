What a charge of Hollywood hold. This film glorifies the mutiny as brave and noble, whether for pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, who is promoted for his betrayal. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is it still a return on investment for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I look cynical, it's because I'm fed up with movies dealing with a political agenda. The military brass in this film are described as what else? Gung-ho War Merchants. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a movie where the CIA or a government agency is not bad? Think about it. Once again, Crimson Tide highlights the point. The character of Hackman, the captain of the submarine Ramsey, appears like a madman, until the end when, of course, he regains his mind, makes a complete 360, renounces his bloodlust, suggests a promotion of traitor Ron Hunter, and repent by withdrawing from the service. A guy mutters himself, takes control of your boat, exposes the United States to the risk of receiving a first nuclear strike and you promote it ???? What crap!
