Anyone who wrote the screenplay of this film obviously never consulted any book about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biographical film, from his early years at Celoron and Jamestown to his last years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but that would continue for pages. In short, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be described by anyone. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be furious with the number of mistakes made in this movie. The filmmakers did their best, but the film seems terribly botched.
