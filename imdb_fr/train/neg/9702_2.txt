I do not think this movie has been rated correctly. I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote R. I would NOT recommend this to people under 17 or 18, regardless of the R limit. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several Indian women topless. I do not know about you, but it's not something that little kids can watch. True, this might be the traditional "dress style" of African Indians (?), But I think partial nudity should give a movie the R rating. <br /> <br /> I do not have saw the movie recently, but I guess otherwise, everything was fine.
