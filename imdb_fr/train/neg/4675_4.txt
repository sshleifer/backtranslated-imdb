"Washington Square" is a flat and shabby adaptation of Henry James's novel. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. Moreover, his simple story without history does not seem suitable for making a film (although William Wyler, with his "The Heiress", gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, unattractive and somewhat awkward, but she's still a healthy and intelligent young woman, and she's not as naive as it sounds. His attachment to his father is dignified and respectful, without any morbid side. Over the course of three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be suffering from a mental retardation, a poor thing. In the last trimester, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, conscious of her dignity as a woman. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when Catherine, a nervous child, has problems with her vesica. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of brothel, with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents, etc. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and wise, even for the standards of the Victorian era. I challenge anyone to find any rudeness in the thousands of pages of James' enormous literary output. These two scenes made me particularly angry. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs a reasonable freedom to adapt a novel to the screen. But if a director completely ignores or understands the art of an author (here, Henry James), I do not see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is appropriate for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a bad movie.
