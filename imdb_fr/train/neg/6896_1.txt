Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to rate judges at a level below 1. What a pity. This horrible movie is so bad that I actually turned off this damn thing well before the end. The script had some brilliant moments, but the realization, the editing, the audio quality and especially the timing of the broadcast online were so abominable that they made the judges unbearable. <br /> <br /> The judges were presented as modern comics day Western, but in reality was not the same. What it looks like the most is a dog poop at the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend that everything is fine, but that only continues to stink. <br /> <br /> Why do video libraries think that it is normal to lead this kind of bullshit with constant gaps in the audio and worse than the high school play class is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than what is on television. But Judges is worse than the most pathetic original of SciFi Channel. I intend to claim my money from Hollywood Video.
