A ridiculous "period" film is just a small excuse for her detailed graphic description of the heroin affair with "the beast", a monster supposed to rape some women every century. That's about what he does, and the description of the beast in the movie is really awful; This is basically a tall man dressed in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard skin that sucks a lot of white liquid. For fans of fake pornographic porn, I guess that may be an interesting topic. However, the first shots of horses kissing in a public square amused me.
