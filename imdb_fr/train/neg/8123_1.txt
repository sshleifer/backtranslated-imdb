(spoilers) Wow, it's a bad one. The other day, I made a double take watching an old episode of Star Trek - it was the one where everyone was infected with space sickness and got a little crazy - and there was Stewart Moss, aka the inimitable "hero" of It Lives by night! He played the first infected crew member, who dies of a terminal depression. All I could think of was that he had watched too much of his own movie, which is what caused the depression. This movie is full of really amazing people. There is no redeeming character in the movie, not one. It's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck's transformation into a bat (or anything in fact), because you just do not like it. And you do not like his skinny, shrill wife, or the ugly sgt Sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest time or energy in this movie? When there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to worry about it. Not to mention the horrendous cinematography, which gave the impression that they had filmed the film with urine, and special effects of thirty hundred strokes, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan for simulate hordes of flying bats. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but in the bottom row, that's for sure.
