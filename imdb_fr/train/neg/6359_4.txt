Woody Allen, when he is at his best, has one of the sharpest pens. He can make a precise observation and wrap it around a striking line like no one else. However, when he is at his worst, his films can stink of pretension. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this stench of opening to closing. The set up is one of his most intriguing ideas in a while. Four friends sitting in a restaurant discuss whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help settle the dispute, a man tells the beginning of a story and asks the two other men who are discussing (one is a comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright) if the story is a comedy or a tragedy . The two men then continue the story and the film stages the stories they weave. Now, when I first heard about this film, I thought I understood that they were telling exactly the same story. Genre (comedy or drama) changes only by the way you look at it. It would have been interesting. However, the stories share only one main element and some secondary elements. These are totally different stories with major differences of plot. The drama is so rigorously written and pretentious that it can only really work as a self-parody. If this were the case, it failed because these elements prevented the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are always short and fleeting. Will Farrell is obviously supposed to be Woody's replacement, but he could have played this character much more likely without adding Woody's controllers and ticks. Woody is the best to be Woody. When someone else tries, they do not play a character, they model a recognizable actor. This kind of thing just takes the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little lighter than I entered. It made me want my money back.
