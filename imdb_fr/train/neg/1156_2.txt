Watching tenants has been an interesting experience for me. This is the first film I saw where I sailed quickly in some parts of the action (no) - and I can normally watch movies ranging from turgid action movies to independent Serb-Croatian films and find fascinating. <br /> <br /> The Tenants is frustrating and lazy and too orchestrated. One of the main problems with the scenario is that there are few realistic character dialogs, other than the scenes where the characters "clash" in a very structured setting (for this work to be done, the film had to be more conceptual, which was not the case.) This leads to a lack of realistic development; everyone seems in two dimensions. <br /> <br /> The worst is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his description very uncomfortable and very unfriendly. At one point, I even stopped the film because I was bored a lot with the aggressive, violent and monotonous character, the absence of a layer of personality other than the reactionary switch (which really becomes predictable after a while). and I so desperately wanted him to have redeeming qualities. However, one of the reasons for this jar could be the nebulous temporal aspect of the film (so-called 70's, it feels and looks earlier than the year). If the film had been better set in the 70s, his character would have seemed more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also embarrassing. Throughout the play, the soundtrack tries to create a serene atmosphere, imbued with jazz, which simply did not go out, largely because of the excessive lighting of the decor. <br /> <br /> The Tenants, for me, it's an incredible movie. It does not describe real people and does not offer any interesting way to think about the race, the identity or the life of a writer, whether in black or in black. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I left with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; its strange, clastrophobic and obsessive aspect would have brought the actors and the scenario to become something quite remarkable.
