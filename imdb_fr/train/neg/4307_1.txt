It seems almost laughable to be a thriller of a movie. It made me scream "Oh my God!" more than once in the complicated plots of the plot that were simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Fanciful or absurd places just because of the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, almost impossible, of human reactions and circumstances understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have the time and want to discover how bad a photo can be, you will want to see it. If not, spend some time watching it dry to get a more productive investment! <br /> <br /> (The fact that a film released in 2003 was already aired on television in July 2003 could give an indication of the quality of the film.)
