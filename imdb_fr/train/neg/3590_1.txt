How much can someone sink when trying to regain an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing what has contributed to a good Star Trek show, DO NOT look at this. <br /> <br /> The writing is complicated -podge, the representation of the characters by their actors is weak, and above all, the work of design is downright far-fetched. <br /> <br /> Like watching strong captains, do not look here! Do you like the strong attitude of the federation? Forget it here! Starfleet is ridiculed by signs wearing SPIKES in the hair. <br /> <br /> While an apparently mentally weak captain is struggling and within two minutes of opening credits, Ensign Spikey is trying to arrange an appointment with an engineer. It is getting worse from there. No, even the uniforms do not match, for God's sake. They are too small or too big, they have tight collar in the chest and TNG uniforms Seasons One and Two mix with the Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of one of the originals regarding the lack of this production up to the tread! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seems to improve a bit with each season. OK, I get that back. Who uses the CG as inexpertly? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not bother, it will disturb your sense of Star Trek, like mine. Even backtracking of previous shows can not save this disaster. <br /> <br /> I cried openly, looking at it, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost torn. So bad.
