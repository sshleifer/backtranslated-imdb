I have never seen the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so I have no way of comparing. In addition, it's been a few years, but I found this story neither captivating nor captivating. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers go in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out and disillusioned rock star who is embarking on a romantic adventure with Esther Hoffman, a new and talented singer. His dramatic success only underscores his decline. <br /> <br /> Lead actors Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand have a good role to play, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left a mark for me. The film only interests me in one aspect, Streisand's magnificent interpretation of the Oscar-winning song "Evergreen". She really has a powerful and beautiful voice.
