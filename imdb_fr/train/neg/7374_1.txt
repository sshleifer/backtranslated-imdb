This is without a doubt the worst film that Steven Seagal has ever made. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the odds, it's too good. This abomination had not even been worthy of a score of 0/10, if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no conspiracy <br /> <br /> - The worst action scenes, and they are not very numerous either <br /> <br /> - Seagal does it not anything himself, including the fight, the conversation (a lot of dubbing), etc. Like always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and makes fun of this movie. Something quite obvious <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV movies that Seagal has created, multiply them with each other, multiply it with a billion, and all the trouble you Then, do not even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
