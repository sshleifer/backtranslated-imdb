There is not one sympathetic character in this movie. Is the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we are supposed to look for? Let's see - we learn that he is a defense lawyer who keeps criminals away from technical details. He treats his coworkers as cattle, makes them part of his own crisis (by killing one of them), endangers the safety of his children, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to give a strong hand to the police and school administrators - and all for what? Because he thought with his little head! I was really trying to get the father and his band triumphing over the lawyer and drowning him in the swamp ... that would have resulted in a much more satisfying end.
