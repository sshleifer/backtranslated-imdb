Suppose you have been on a desert island for ten years. I did not hear about Scream and I left when Halloween, the first part, went to the movies. So this film would have been an explosion and a completely new vision on the horror scene. <br /> <br /> For the moment, the score of 2.7 is on IMDb and it does not deserve such an appreciation. Cutting all the way, like "I know what you did," and one who, arriving at the end, convinced me of who and why. <br /> <br /> No big surprise, just a nice movie to watch with a cola, popcorn and no desire to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If video rentals are not among the best titles, you can take them without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I saw a lot worse.
