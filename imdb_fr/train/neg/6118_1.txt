This is not a very good story of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in '10' was at least a humorous film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing but soft porn. If you like it, then go ahead and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was once again a way for Bo Derek to show off his dramatic play. She is definitely a gorgeous woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this one; This was one of his rare mistakes! do not waste your time on this movie ... buy the book instead.
