Well, I could not get into the plot, but it's just me maybe. Sometimes senseless camera movements, nevertheless, this film has a charming vintage quality. The acting is sometimes authentic and fun with an occasional chase sequence involving lightly dressed ladies, which was nice. The climax is confused and disjointed, but still ... overboard, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> The waterfalls are interesting, especially because of the Las Vegas backdrop of the 70s. There are some jerky camera movements in the end at the end, which let me guess for a moment. But I do not think I will continue the DVD, for now.
