I have not seen anything so serious since I came out of the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit on the whole of it just because of Tilda Swinton, but she could not do anything to save this beast. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film has failed miserably in all aspects of the realization. The characters were cardboard and could not arouse any sympathy. The plot was totally amazing. The acting game was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. The computer images were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what is the goal? <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in the movie. I do not know at all why an actress of her caliber agreed to appear in such a game, but she most probably regrets it now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or your time on this whore. There is nothing worth seeing here.
