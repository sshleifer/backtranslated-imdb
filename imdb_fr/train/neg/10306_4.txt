After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up this show because it unrealistically portrays what mathematical modeling is. In the episodes where Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought my profession was joked. I am not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to the "pretense" of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a difficult task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he should spend a lot of time looking for a suitable model, especially to try to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and random, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a specific type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoictic) model, which means that it has a good chance of making a difference. bad prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, suppose that the right model for someone a situation is found, the parameters of the model must be known. These parameters are the equation constants, such as the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2), and are often difficult to determine. Once again, Charlie Eppes should be someone extraordinary to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And once the model and the chosen parameters, they should be tested. Oddly enough, they are not, and miraculously, they exactly match the predicted situation. <br /> <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by sci. -fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to get Excel to solve a complex model with many equations and variables and find Herculean work. Although Charlie Eppes has the appropriate software to solve his models, he may be stuck with hardware that will be terribly slow. And even with the right combination of software and hardware, the model solution can take days to reach. He solves them immediately! I could use his computer in my research, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a theater, it is far from the best show. The characters are a little stereotyped, but not as funny as those of Big Bang Theory. The crimes are bland and the way Charlie Eppes fixes them sometimes gives the FBI looks rather incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some laypersons, the program could work. For others, the way things are treated makes it hard to swallow!
