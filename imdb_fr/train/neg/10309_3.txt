"CIA Codename: Alexa" is a horrible scam of Luc Besson's classic film "The Woman Nikita" (1990). The film is about a woman who is cared for and trained by the CIA and who is forced to do a secret mission for them. (About the same story structure of The Nikita Wife) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in film history. The "game" of Lamas is simply a bad imitation of Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal play in this movie is an excruciating experience. <br /> <br /> The writing and the acting are so mediocre in this film that it is sometimes laughable. There are so many "conventions" of action movies in the movie that it's ridiculous: useless car explosions, people flying through glass panes, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The score resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which continues Steven Segal's theme of this film. There is a lot of martial arts in the film, and it's pretty well done for a low-budget American production. Foolish action and acting never let go, and I must admit I was moderately entertained. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas looked like an action star in the early '90s, but he's certainly not an action star, so he's doing soap operas and not blockbusters. I recommend that you skip "CIA Code Name: Alexa" and consult "The Nikita Woman" instead.
