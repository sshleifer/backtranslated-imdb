There are good things about the movie. Music and cinematography are excellent. Alex Wilson is hot and gives an excellent performance. Ryan Bauer is hot too. The production was very lucky to have them mounted because they really give a production value to the film. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many boys in the movie who do not speak are too cute. Why is the actress who plays Amy not registered in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a superb comic performance in the role of Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He can not act. He is also very skinny, not pleasant to watch. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It's no wonder he has to create his own movie and get started. No one else would throw him in anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not credible as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he behaves so cheerful. They should have chosen someone else in mind if they wanted the best for the movie. Again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a way to get into soft-core porn without really being an actor because he would have taken acting lessons. Plus, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about this film is probably the casting of a dark skinned Latina like Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem to be an actress at all. All in all, this movie is soft-core porn and is no better than what you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed and does not want to be associated with it. There is no picture on his IMDb page and nothing else is listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name. Also, I met him by chance in West Hollywood once and when I mentioned this movie, he turned around and left. I understand. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and I would not want to be associated with it either.
