HAH! This is the film in which the "Next Action Stars" are launched. Well, I'm happy not to have participated and not to have won ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny to be able to watch the first 10 seconds (!) And get an idea ? about a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "game show" because it was produced for television and we could not stand watching it all) one night while doing my military service and the audience that accompanied me was the typical mishmash of the average guys who from time to time watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the series. so the bar was not very high, the most watched movie of my group was Girl Next Door (and it was not because of the great script, D. But the total lack of originality of this film, its game actor, his scenario and pretty much everything else, it's very easy to change channels in Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I do not remember ...) without the rest of the group complains about nothing, and it's rare (!) Good God, do not do this movie If it's on TV, look at it and think about it ... My conclusion - well, since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action movies (Die Hard, Matrix 1) To name just a few, I can only say that producers do not give the film its quality, they provide money to the directors, and sell this film just because that it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew that really did it.
