I released very few movies before they were done, but I could not finish this trash. This is the biggest charge of racism that we have been trying to pass off as a legitimate movie since "Birth of a Nation". The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see how an actor would like his name to be associated with this film. Lee must have better things to do than throw garbage like this. I know that anyone with a brain has better things to do ... like watching the paint dry. I want someone to make a movie about race relations that deals with the subject realistically. There is much more depth in this subject, the superficial speech of a bitter director like Lee.
