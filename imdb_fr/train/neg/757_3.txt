My children watch the show every day. It is an excellent program for young children. However, they must stop showing off their reruns, make other rounds and get rid of Rooney and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with white mother-of-pearl teeth and the kids notice it and ask if the 2 never brush their teeth? Does the show go to the United States and, if so, where can we find its schedule at. And another thing if we could be able to add. Moe, you have to stop hiding as much. Sometimes, when you come out of nowhere, you scare the younger ones and shoot with the rope? What does that mean? other then get wet all the time. They have to add new things to their show instead of the same thing. The children lose interest.
