How did Mike Hammer live in an apartment with a GOLF bag hidden in a corner next to a big CRT TV and a chimney fire? Nah, he would spill a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or the floor of his office stained with flies or in the stench of a lousy downtown LA flop house, wiping the dried red crust and mud stained with oil on his face, that's how it is. Spillane has written paperbacks, of course, but how do you make the situation worse? Give a desperate scheming producer a blank check, because he thinks that the whole fucking Black Film will be sold at the box office, add extravagant hot tomatoes and will simply mess up the screenplay of some delayed and addicted screenwriters, it's like it!
