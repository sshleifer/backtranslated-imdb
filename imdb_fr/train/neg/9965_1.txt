WARNING! DETAILS OF SMALL GROUNDS ANNOUNCED! <br /> <br /> I can not find anything positive to say about this film. It is written so badly that each character is a caricature, yet he seems to take himself seriously. He is misinterpreted, especially Ralph Macchio (a baby face, nothing less than him) like a hard streetwise. The elements of the plot are all drawn in black and white, and each situation degenerates almost immediately into an extreme climax. <br /> <br /> The most egregious of all (plot element about to be revealed), it has perhaps the most gratuitous and unnatural nude scene in the history of semi-serious film. We can imagine that the filmmakers say: "We need JoBeth to get rid ... hmmm ... I have it! ... at the beginning of the film, give Nick a ridiculous dialogue about getting you to naked in the corridors ... ..well that JoBeth can use this sentence later and REALLY get naked in the hallway ... yeah, that's the right ticket! "<br /> <br /> I'll give the credit to producers for tackling a thorny issue in 1984, the one that weighed heavily in the late 1990s with events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrible. This film could have been a black comedy in the sense of "Heathers", a rowdy political statement of the kind "Network" or a serious examination of the genre "Brubaker". Instead, he tries to be all these things - and ends up being none of them. "Teachers" get an F.
