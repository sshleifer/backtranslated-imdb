Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A biangle of love (sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!), An interesting story, unfortunately poorly told. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes correct, the photo looks crowded and myopic. Sound needs more attention (which is usually the case in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About the actor ... sorry but the best actress is the owner. The others act immature and can not convince the viewer. The acting is poetic when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetic. It is an image for adults, told by children. Disturbs that so extremely curious.
