I searched this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst filmmakers of all time, with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was a bit disappointed because even though the movie was really bad, it had never reached the level of seriousness of some of its previous schlocky movies. Because of that, this movie was not particularly fun to watch for bad moviegoers. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm suspicious of this film, because the title "Naughty Stewardesses" gives the impression that the film has a pornographic movie - something I would not see on IMDb. However, this film seemed to be this sometimes - especially the first 10 minutes. But, you can say that the script has undergone many changes, because for most of the film, there is no titillation and by the end of the film, a plot comes from nowhere that is violent and certainly NOT sexy. ! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts are good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it is incomprehensible that they place a 71-year-old guy in some love scenes. Of course, Mr. Livingston, 71, looked pretty good, but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him train with a young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston has become a guy like Rambo! Talk about weird and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is not much to recommend to this sad movie. It's not serious enough or sexy enough to worry about it and the movie manages to be rather boring, even with a title as crazy as "Naughty Stewardesses".
