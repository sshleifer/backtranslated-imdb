I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrolling the North Atlantic and it was the movie of the evening. We all gave up after the second reel. They did not even try to show it during the night screening. Opting for a recovery instead ...... That's all I have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I'm not supposed to tap the comment with random words, so I'll continue to walk until my ten lines of BS reach me. I did not find George Goble in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. The sining was terrible and the songs even worse.
