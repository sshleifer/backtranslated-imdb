I liked it, but I thought I might have ironed at the same time. This reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a perfectly simplistic formula, saved from a formula saved from the video ignominy on its exit by the sharp turn of Janeane Garofalo. By playing the Frasier of Pets, she finds herself trapped in love when insecurity causes her to miss out on her best friend (Uma Thurman) as if she herself came to call him a caller. interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave a shot to the Hollywood treadmill with this movie. He is remarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising, even though he has appeared in many cameos in the last two films of Terence Malick. Uma Thurman makes an automatic lap of the autopilot and Michael Lehmann groups it competently. Icky phone sex though. 4/10
