I will admit that I am only a university student at the moment, a major in English. At the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I mean a junior year, but maybe it was older, hard to remember. My experience of quantum physics is quite similar to my course in specialized physics, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read on the subject in many books on the theoretical aspects of the field, as well as in any article that I can find in Discover and similar. I am in no way a doctorate. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. It was designed to attract the scientific spirit of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in the specificity of each. My mother is such a person and since she saw this movie she tried to show it to all her friends and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various flaws and problems I had seen with the logic and science of movies - and there are many - and she rejected my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all these people with a doctorate. "In this case, apparently. <br /> <br /> Leaving behind the fact that obtaining a doctorate does not necessarily require that the person is correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to demystify half of the film. Leaving this behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to show that he supported their beliefs even though he was completely opposed to it. <br /> <br /> I could go on and but I think intuitor really did a good job of demystifying the movie, so feel free to read it if you wish. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
