Why do all Lifetime movies have such anemic titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​ooh, what a provocation !! "That, I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. Real people do not really speak like these characters and the situations are really mundane. The heterosexual woman who "transforms herself" into a lesbian seemed more butchish than the lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot women kissing in a very discreet way, you could enjoy it. Although it seems like it was written by someone who does not really get out of the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about this?
