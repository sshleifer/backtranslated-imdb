I hired this film in anticipation of some laughter, enough for me to have fun, but I was terribly wrong. This film showed very humorous moments of humor and the pathetic jokes made me feel ashamed to have hired it forever ... This film, intended for 10-15 years, will certainly leave the audience feeling very dissatisfied. Do not deserve more than 3 votes, but very little recommended for those who do not want to lose 2 hours of their life.
