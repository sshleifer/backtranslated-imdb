This movie is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". Why? Because the only thing that redeems me is the joyful laugh that I had before the ridiculous ridicule of absurd, senseless intrigue and horrible play. Wow! <br /> <br /> In this film, there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are the "guardians" of zombies and what is their purpose? Since when do 6 people form a "nation" of zombies? And is spotted black-eyed mascara "scary" for anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this film made? Why? Why? Why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> On demand channel, they published this comment after the synopsis of the film: We apologize for this movie in advance "LOL At least they had the decency to do it !
