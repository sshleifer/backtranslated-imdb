In fact, I saw this movie at the cinema in its original version. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrass himself so badly. The story was incredibly lame and hard to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen. I will not say I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt he was giving a strong performance in Being There. But this movie should never have been done. From what I read, he continued production of this film against the advice of people around him. Well, but that still does not excuse the studio that publishes the film.
