I came across Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking that I could deal with an average movie. This film was however slightly below average, but observable. The script was poorly written and the acting was on average for a B movie with a couple that stood out pretty well. The plot merges with Saw's, teach people what they did wrong in a given situation, and try to make them enjoy life more, but that's where the comparison ends. Nine dead are trying to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main fault I found in Nine Dead is the slap the viewer felt at the flashbacks that happened 3 minutes before in the movie and that were completely useless and a completely inadequate ending that people will not see coming. Apart from the spoilers, I saw the worst of the bad movies and even these did not end so badly. Decent shot, bad game and ending well ...
