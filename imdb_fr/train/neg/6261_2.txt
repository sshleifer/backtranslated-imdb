A couple settles in the house of their dreams, unaware that it and its neighbors were built on land formerly used as a cemetery. It is said that the film is based on a true story, although most of what is supposed to be true is not revealed. The plot is far from unique - see "Poltergeist" by Spielberg (1982). In a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: they range from disturbing mysterious shadows to serious illness of the girl, passing ridiculous ridiculous, flushing and loss of control of doors garage. The story has little depth: once it has been established that the land was used as a cemetery, nothing is learned. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are neither particularly well drawn nor memorable, nor the particular atmosphere. The film could disturb some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or positive message of this kind.
