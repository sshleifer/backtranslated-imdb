The worst film of David Lean. Even 'In which we serve' was not as bad as that. Usually, a film with a very good reputation like this one has at least some redeeming qualities, which helps to understand why it could be considered a classic. But after looking at that, I just did not understand why this shit was so popular, even in 1945! I did not like the mannerisms, the story, the script (which can sometimes be quite spiritual but totally foolish) and the soundtrack of the film. The elvira character is supposed to be attractive and attractive, but was actually ugly and had a strange and boring voice. Just another film that convinced me not to trust the reputation of a movie. Another British classic very overestimated.
