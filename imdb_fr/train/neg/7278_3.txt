This barely watchable film was a bit of a challenge to overcome. None of the segments are good, but at least the first was slightly amusing and the second was somewhat imaginative. The last was simply brutal, and after sitting down through two comical short films, the third was really painful to watch. Even with the mediocre standards of a National Lampoon film, this one seemed particularly boring and joyless.
