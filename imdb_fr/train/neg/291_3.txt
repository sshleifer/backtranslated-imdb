The film version of Sandra Bernhard's off-stage show is completely pretentious. Sandra parodies salon numbers and superstars, but her sense of irony is only interesting and funny. Her fans will say that she is extremely honest, and that may be true. But she is also piercing, with an insolent bravado that is not suitable for a film like this. She does not want to be nice - and she's certainly not made to make friends - and it's always going to rub a lot of people. But even if you meet her halfway, her material is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, although it was not directed by him, the film has its signature style cold and detached. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; Their strangest touch was to make all of Sandra's internal audiences look completely bored - a feeling many viewers will likely share. * 1/2 of ****
