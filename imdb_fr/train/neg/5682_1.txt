This film is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but it's the worst I've ever seen. I am a big fan of gore, but most of the dead in this movie are not shown. It just shows us the bodies already dead, and the only death scenes they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics seem so wrong. The actors are awful too. There is no real emotion of any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this movie sh * t, but I had to submit to actual images of animals beaten at the beginning of it. If I could give a score of -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's dung. <br /> <br /> Do not look at him.
