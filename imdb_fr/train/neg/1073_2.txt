I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The gingerbread man starts on the right foot and manages to create great expectations for the end. But at one point, the movie becomes one of the worst stories I've lost my time on. It's so amazing how Mallory Doss manages to draw Kenneth Branagh's character through the nose. The apogee of cinema is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, too long exposed to the sun. The gingerbread man is probably Grisham's worst film to date and that does not change the fact that talented stars fill the film. Do not waste your time here!
