"Stella Dallas" of 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck has not really aged well - the way anyone who thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real headache. Maybe they thought Bette Midler could get something out of it, but that erased scenario defeated her. Plot on the fact that a bartender woman has a baby out of wedlock and, years later, gives the girl to the child's rich father so that she can embark on a better life, can not escape the feelings and to the poor old-fashioned appearance. Midler works better with a director who can control her excesses, but that does not happen here. Stephen Collins is stupid as a man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well chosen for Midler's daughter. It was once called a "woman's image", a wildfire, but it is not doubtful, because it remains too faithful to its origins of the 1930s. * 1/2 of ****
