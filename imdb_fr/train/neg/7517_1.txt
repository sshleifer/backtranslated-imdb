*** One star in ten *** <br /> <br /> Because if that were the case, it would give a Br. Holy Mother Mary of God so terrible. I mean, I gave him all reasonable accommodations, considering it was a movie directly, but he let me down every turn. Like so many other B-movies, the baseline was fine and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It's a pity that they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic principle revolves around a few frat shower bags hosting their annual fundraiser for the haunted Halloween house, when a book of satanic spells pops out of nowhere and throws the boys out of frat in a living hell. In any case, it's the idea, but instead, most of the film is devoted to the presentation of the love affair of these fraternal boys, full of infernal lesbian intrigue. Very little of the story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. It makes me really angry that the filmmakers thought they could afford such a dribble. <br /> <br /> The film mainly deals with relationships between boys. This is not what the film is charged. I am tempted to hunt down producers and at the very least to threaten them with bodily harm. The acting is about as bad as it gets, it's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny. Cinematography is simply lazy. The whole movie is the amateur night. This film actually gives the SyFy productions masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the film was such that the filmmakers realized that they did not produce a soap opera and therefore had horror sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into a character dressed as. I almost want to cry writing this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an undecipherable deciphered disaster.
