Tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story is written, it seems, without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the problem of methamphetamine. I know that Farnsworth comes from Iowa, which makes his film even more disconcerting for me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It does not mean anything. The acting was at best mediocre and sometimes difficult to watch. Free violence and sex filled the film. I guess violence and sex were supposed to make the movie upset, but it seemed incredible and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliant that all I could do was laugh and watch the credits in disbelief. Leaving the theater, everyone leaving was laughing with me. The end of the movie was supposed to bring tears, but it did exactly the opposite. Do not waste your time on this horrible film, unless you want to see an ignorant fight, sap, excitement, clich√©.
