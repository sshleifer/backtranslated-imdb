With this cast and this budget, you expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has directed a number of films that curl the weird, but still work. Neither he, nor his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this parody of mundane garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing more than a series of visual gags and more poor people. The plot is not going anywhere, the writing is artificial, insane and very fine characters. If you think of a three-dimensional film where the story and the characters bring a depth to the imagery, this stinker seems as flat as the mickey of the steamboat. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Akroyd in this film reminded another really horrible film, Nothing's Trouble of 1991. Frankly, this film is the type of project that kills quarries and fired agents.
