This film is so bad that it simply defies reality. Filming is at best a school material, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banned from making films. So bad that it can not even be seen as a comedy like Showgirls. The ONLY thing of this DVD was the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who have not had the misfortune to witness this is to kindly give you a well-deserved advance and do not waste your time or money on this piece. garbage. If you want to see a movie for the comic aspect, there are many more worthy in such a realm as this trash.
