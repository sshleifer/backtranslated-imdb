1st seen 26/05/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Funny story of a druid wizard who tries to capture eternity by inheriting the body of his granddaughter. At least I think it was the relationship. Throughout this film, we find a sort of disturbing quality just like Stephen King's film The Shining. The difference is that Nicholson's performance was serene and not at all in this movie. All this is taken very seriously until the end, when a few attempts to try to brighten the mood do not work at all. Performance is not the problem here, but the story is. Not everything seems to fit very well together and the viewer is left with a lot of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. Christopher Walken, the uncle of the granddaughter, has a very small performance to throw which, of course, earned him the star to try to sell the film. Do not buy this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
