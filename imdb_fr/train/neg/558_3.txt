It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone rewarded viewers with a leg crossing that twisted the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, she is in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the successful "Basic Instinct" eroticism featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original might not even get close to it, because "Instinct 2" is a painful film, as the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones murders the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film begins when a car explosion interferes at the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy) is a suspect and seems to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is responsible for examining it but ends up cracking for an intimate game of seduction. <br /> <br /> And here, without additional explanations, is the fundamental force that animates this "Instinct". We do not explain much and we have to sit through a shabby class C erotic film. Sharon Stone plays in her first role where she most often plays a role in the filming. Partly because of amateur writing, careless management and terribly low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a scenario of three scenes was cut so that it is not classified NC-17) as the first entry of the series. "Instinct" is an irrefutable torture. <br /> <br /> To top it off, everything that made the original movie a guilty pleasure is nowhere to be found in the film. Playing here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some strengths, but here she becomes extremely obnoxious. David Morrisey plays the lead role in the worst role of his life and seems to never do more than two confused and excited movie expressions. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an original series by the way, which was very successful in putting on hold with Erotica. Paul Verhoeven, I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounds like a good movie and, in fact, it's not. Some movies should never go out of print, and that's the feeling you feel after watching this. It is now much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg have dropped out of school, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this ...... ----- 3/10
