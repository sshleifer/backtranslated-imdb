I rented Hybrid at the weekend. What a desappointment! A stupid attempt at a tele-movie. The guy they had for the head was totally weak and when he ran, he seemed to eat those mints ... with his back! The contacts he had with the wolves were excellent, although I feel that the actor relied too much on them because his behavior was not threatening. The Indian Indian Chick Sage must be one of the most stony dogs in the world. You speak of a sour cow! She smiled about once during the whole movie, and I think it's because she had sex. The sex scene was also lame. They may have also shown swelling curtains, if you can dig them. <br /> <br /> Finally, and it's a big animal that hates me, on the cover and on the DVD menu, the losers digitally drew cool pointy teeth on the guy. They were nowhere in the film. :(
