Even if it was funny, this moldy wax film would always be disrespectful. Stop a little before unearthing the corpses of the boys and restoring "Weekend At Bernie's" ?? but only just ?? Producer Larry Harmon and director of Frickin's "Ernest" films use copyright as a pretext to demolish the legacy of Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain mimics Ollie but Bronson Pinchot would not reach tenth place in Stan's look-alike contest; even if they were both present in the film, they would not be less detestable. The less we say about disaster, the better. Utopia looks like a song worthy of a swan.
