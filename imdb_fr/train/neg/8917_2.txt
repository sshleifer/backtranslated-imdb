The precondition for making such a film is a total ignorance of Nietzsche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and the history of Vienna. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe him as insane, include crazy doctors to treat him, a few pretty women, play his part by an actor with a huge mustache, ask each character to speak with the strongest Accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious character who has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention a few words used in the works of genius, exaggerate everything you can , especially the music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
