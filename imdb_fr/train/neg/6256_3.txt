Hmm ?? I agree with the critic who said that "strange people with generous tastes re-read this film". I thought the movie was intriguing enough to watch it. I think it's mainly because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is slightly psychologically tempting, and deeply homophobic, on the other. Bravo first and triple last. I do not know if the film aims to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. A lot of 90-degree conversation of reality. I wanted to continue to make sense of the plot, but it's finally just a conversation with a crazy man (Speedman). I feel slightly sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. Its loss is neither greater nor less than the losses suffered every day in the world by more important causes. <br /> <br /> Does the film expose the naivety of HIV / AIDS? Yes: the target audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious and perverse assassin? What about victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malevolent intent than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, CANCER, or their victims, FOR GOD SAKE. The mere fact that a disease is transmissible does not make it deliberate or negligent - or devil - it IS. <br /> <br /> Does this excuse ignorance or unthinking risk-taking? - NO. Should everyone have safe sex? - YES. Will protected sex save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings? ?? OF COURSE NOT. In what kind of world would we live if everyone followed the rules, if no one took risks, and if sex was never spontaneous and passionate? Am I unaware that the film deals specifically with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is spread by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected people. Sex is not necessary for transmission, be it gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by the deliberate violence of one person on another. In fact, I thought the film described the absurdity of Tom's violent kidnapping, captivity, and intention toward Dan, and this senseless violence happens every day. <br /> <br /> the movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why does Dan not ask "why" do you feel so, rather than "what are you doing"? Involvement: men who have sex with men contract "AIDS" Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in the sexual act? Why was Dan's responsibility to use the condom? "Maybe you slipped it before you put it in?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth" you make fun of me "She is in heaven and is so hurt by what she now knows about me"? Is Dan's life over if he is HIV-positive? Certainly not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic ???? Do they think that gay men are the cause of HIV, that they will pass it on to the rest of the world and that we all die? I hope you are joking??? Are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ??? Do we feel the same way about the victims of TB? Malaria? I can see that Tom is hurt because of the death of his wife, and he attributes that to AIDS, but seriously? who is at fault here? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the patient? (assuming they do not seek and do not seek to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Certainly, protected sex is essential to a safe life, but the same is true for not driving, not stealing, not leaving home, non-living. Do we really want to blame the victims for the disease? Could protected sex between Tom and Dan have prevented the ultimate death of Tom's wife? Maybe, but not only Dan's responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did I mention that? <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? LET'S GO! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Do I react excessively? Perhaps. But I think this film points the finger at gay men for their reckless and malicious intent toward a "rectilinear world" by practicing unprotected sex, when the rate of homosexuals practicing safer sex is proportionally equal to or greater than heterosexuals. We must all wake up and take the problem of HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of African STRAIGHT every year.
