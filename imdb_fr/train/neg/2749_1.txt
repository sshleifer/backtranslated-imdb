This movie was so badly written. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a film of it. My 11 year old son could write a better screenplay than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor not to fear is the keeper of the zoo. He was the only funny and credible character of the lot. <br /> <br /> I like movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was at the top of my lame list at number 2. Number 1 is demonic. <br /> <br /> For those of you who thought it was a good movie, you really need a brain operation. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's creatures were weren 't even the dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
