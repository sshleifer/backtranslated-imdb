The first half of this film is pure delight. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performances. A very close brother and sister living in Manhattan fall in love with the same woman! Adult. Brilliant. Spiritual. What more could you ask for? As a romantic comedy, it starts to refresh. He is heading for unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It goes from a universal adult comedy story to a birth story that begins in adulthood and has been made many times before. What a desappointment. As a people's film, it starts with such a promise. Why does it have to become a pedestrian movie "I am who I am"? The last frozen image of Heather Graham jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness to meet again" underscores the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magic. He ended up being the same old man.
