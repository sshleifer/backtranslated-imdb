The message of this film is "Personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not ugly at all (in fact, she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the girlfriend who looks like a model). > Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message he wants to convey, this film is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
