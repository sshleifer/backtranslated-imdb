As difficult as I can believe, with all the terrible reality shows of recent years, it must take first place for the worst. I still wonder if this was actually a parody made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind all that. Can a rock band lower down than INXS to do such a shameful thing? The premise is simple and weak. Hear a karaoke band that refuses to become INXS 'new lead singer, replacing Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hit later, the band commits the ultimate act of pathos by pretending to audition a band of talented aspiring talentless and become the new singer of a group that is 20 years old. So, they trot all those awful singers (I thought American Idol had his share of doozies) that make atrocious performances of almost every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then, the members of the INXS band seriously discussed the merits of each of these candidates. You can see better (and more original) rock artists in almost every disco in every city in the world. <br /> <br /> It contains all the creative elements of all other reality shows. Participants in an alleged reality, lame interviews, lame host / host, "judging" lame performances, and limping start at the end of each show. Can these shows be more predictable? This is clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the group; a last breath of hope to regain their lost celebrity before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any dignity when he was alive, had to turn in his grave. Not that INXS was a big band, but I did not know they were so pathetic. If INXS is really representative of what rock and roll has become, this show will be the definitive proof that rock and roll is definitely dead.
