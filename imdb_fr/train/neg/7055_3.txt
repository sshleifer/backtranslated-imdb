Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the last person who said "I missed the ride". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just terrible. The performances were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emraan deserved something better. CELINA JAITLEY did nothing but expose. Hrishitta Bhatt was OK. Emraan hashmi was also acceptable. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate man who wants to become famous. therefore, he uses RADHA and claims to love it only because his father is a music director and could help him become famous (since the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA for fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls in love with his appearance. He tries to flirt BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then ROMA can not open the door of her room that night and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not as well, ROMA will ask for help. While she is gone, MANN is able to open the door and decide to enter and sit on her bed. BLA BLA BLA. ROMA enters and they have a night stand. However, ROMA falls in love with him during this night. That morning, they spot don (MAHESH), the underground world, which sees everything. The gift loves ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He orders them to marry and, frightened, MANN obeys Merry's order and ROMA. Then, their news on the marriage is found in the newspaper. MANN later discovers that he loves ROMA after making a music video together. He is now trapped between love and glory. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> the movie is horrible. The song "SINI NE SINI NE" is fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also excellent. The title track is also great. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
