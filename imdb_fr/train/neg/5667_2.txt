If I had consulted IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD at Netflix, I would have found a few hours in my life. I am frankly wary when I see that the director of a film also wrote it. In the present case, according to the credits, the same type was "writer and director", which is unfortunately an indication of the general quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, the scene of Judy Tenuta recalling her first comedy routines extolling Judy-ism) which led me to rate two stars rather than one. These moments, however, were few and far between ... and I almost could not see them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention its reprehensible violence. I admit that I went back to watch this game again to see if I had forgotten something that could help me solve the problem once I saw it all. No, although I at least recognized who the characters would become important afterwards. The technique of the "rotating camera" was overused and essentially useless. I found myself talking on the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For God's sake, keep going!" Not recommended.
