A young boy makes a lot of money and starts to party quickly. Unfortunately, the man whose money is really very bad. He wants to recover his booty. When he finds out who has the money, he starts trying to get it back. He keeps failing this little boy who is lucky enough not to fall into the hands of the wicked man. It sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Propose something a little different, ok guys?
