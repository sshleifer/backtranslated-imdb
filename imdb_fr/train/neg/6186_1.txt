The bad weather is coming. Susannah Yorke is a young and bright Jane Eyre and her performance is irreproachable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35 years old. George C. Scott, white-haired, looks and behaves like an arthritic man. He creaks and scolds, odious and sinister. He looks like a murderer with an ax who sent his ax to be sharpened; we are not surprised that he keeps a woman in a cage in the attic! The big love story is like a sado-masochistic nightmare. The novel is rather dark, but Rochston de Bronte is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he chooses to be. He has a beautiful voice that speaks and sings, a good spirit and a conscience that he tries without success to suffocate.
