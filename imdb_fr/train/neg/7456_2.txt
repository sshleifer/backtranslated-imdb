It may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie have stolen an hour and a half of my life and I want to get it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His high-pitched voice and furious beating begin to age, then you realize the rest of the movie is a lot worse. He falls into a long line of former SNL-ers who have tried movies. Some were brilliant, others failed miserably. There is not much of a medium in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, then ok, then not so funny, then dead ... so I guess he's touching the whole spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a plague. c <br />
