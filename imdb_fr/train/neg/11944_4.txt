I rented this film thinking it was the sad and sad version of 1959 that I saw as a child. It was not. So I was very disappointed that I felt like a marginal actor game, a poor development of characters and, above all, a lack of enhancement of the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Dog of Flanders" is only a cute "apart" to the film. Get the 1959 version!
