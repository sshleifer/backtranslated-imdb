I feel like I was caught, the con is on, do not fall into the trap. After reading rave reviews (the director was a film critic with Sky for years, so many friends in the press had to be willing to help him by writing favorable reviews). I was expecting a solid acting game, an atmosphere, a suspense, a strong characterization, an intriguing film. intrigue development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" does not keep the promises of criticism, but sacrifices most of these qualities instead of modest-budget special effects (what was this spider's web scene clichéd here?), Choreography unrealistic combat and nonsensical narration, cliché changes and shooting angles. <br /> <br /> "Sixteen years of alcohol" begins interestingly with some beautiful shots shot in Scotland, but the descent is direct. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that might interest us or creating suspense, the director chooses to start driving you crazy with self-indignant voiceovers. The main characters are so unfriendly and so misinterpreted - the audience does not care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, "tributes" (typical of a director trying to pay his royalties to former masters) are either totally cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me up and kept me in the cinema, but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative linking another period of time to action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film has become more and more flawed and to be quite honest boring. I always watched everything that was happening! <br /> <br /> I guess I liked the film's realistic realism attempt, but even that was destroyed when they were often interspersed with strange, abstract, sometimes useless scenes. You do not need a huge budget to make a really moving film, so much has been said about the little money they had to make this movie, half a million, it's not a bit of money ... SO NOT EXCUSES! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... or their agents thought! <br /> <br /> Spend this turkey unless you're masochistic or stupid anyway .... NOT MY OBJECT <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
