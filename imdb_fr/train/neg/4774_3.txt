I do not know if the filmmakers were after a movie like Saw or 12 Angry Men (people who gather facts to get the truth). Anyway, it was badly done and it was not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I do not watch movies for blood or blood, but because this movie did not have much to do, it should have shown the murder itself. more. Most were off-camera, minimizing the horror we were supposed to feel as a result of the death. <br /> <br /> It also embarrassed me that the policeman was among the victims; he involuntarily contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting the introduced evidence (which MJH gave him) in the evidence room. (And MJH, the Advocate General, would not have had access to this evidence - by removing it and sending it back - anyway, so that she did not need the cop's help? ). The others, even though they often did not realize it was the person they were harming, played a bigger role in her ultimate demise. The arms dealer should know that his weapons would be used for malicious purposes. The type of insurance rejected a person obviously in need, etc. But the police officer's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have gone a step further and made him incite MJH to gather evidence, which would have made him more guilty. And MJH shouting that he (the cop) had put him in this mess makes no sense. <br /> <br /> It would be more intriguing that each person dies in a way that offers others a clue as to why he / she was there and deserved to die. The type of insurance, for example, could have had the demands he had thrown down his throat and choke; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes dead because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent than gun murder, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not spiritual, there were no Twists, and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I have ever seen. The end of the series put three stars on my side. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially because of the generous panic and the motivation with which they had to work. <br /> <br /> Overall, a waste of time.
