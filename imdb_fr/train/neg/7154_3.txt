This film has all the marks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on the autobiography of Shielah Graham, it seems that the powers in place could not leave enough alone. They could not decide whether it was Graham's or Fitzgerald's story, but how smoothly they pedaled, no matter what the story told. Thus, a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious personalities (Mrs. Graham) becomes a monotonous and disproportionate soap opera that says so little about things. In addition, there is absolutely no other period than that of 1959. The clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we do not know where we are in history or how long. However - and that saved the movie for me - Kerr has never been so beautiful and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They really make a beautiful mature couple and I just wish they had better equipment to work with. There is a scene that works: Scott pursues Shielah while he is drunk, and seeing these two refined stars hitting each other is very disturbing and gives a fleeting impression of what is happening in a relationship like their. Apart from that, the film is a missed opportunity and far exceeds the classic stature of the other soaps produced by Wald in the 1950s (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF ALL).
