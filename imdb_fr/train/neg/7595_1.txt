"Ask the Dust" looked intriguing in the trailer, and we particularly like all the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not convincing enough to be considered a drama and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It almost seemed like satire, with no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this situation to improve, my wife and I went out, believing that we had lost no time in such nonsense. It was just not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It seems to be written, produced and directed by a high school student; Worse still, it was a shameful waste of actors with extraordinary talent, not to mention our time and money.
