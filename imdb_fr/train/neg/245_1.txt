Mysterious Planet is one of the worst films of all time, while keeping a great affection in my heart, because the poverty of its special effects and its breathtaking soundtrack during the first 15 minutes (and to say it all is all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilarious-splitting. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in "space" is about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, like bottles of dishwashing liquid to whistle before your eyes dialogue. Before you have had time to determine if you have gone crazy, if the credits are waiting for you and if the action is fighting for life. <br /> <br /> And in addition to the double-headed plasticine snail that terrorizes our heroes, you also get the added double benefit of having the original actors' voices AND doubled voices at the same time. A pure genius. <br /> <br /> What is sad for fans of this kind of fare is that I have never seen a copy, so the chances of seeing it yourself are very unlikely. I may have the only existing copy. <br /> <br />
