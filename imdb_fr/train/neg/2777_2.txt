Unfortunately, this has been shown on Star Movies here in Thailand for about a week. It's a complete game of garbage. As another member said, this film is a good example of "how not to act". I have not seen a film so badly played for a long time. The actors (can you call them "actors"?) Are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad the game is, you would have to see the movie ... but it would be like torture. <br /> <br /> I cringe when the main woman delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or artificial) is also obnoxious. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her terrible accent. Mix that with his (lack of) game and you have a disaster. She should not have said anything and I could have accepted her as a pretty girl. Oh my God, we just got to where the lover of the main woman says, "Really me?" after a scene of forced crying on his part. Ridiculous. No, really, I just laughed with laughter. <br /> <br /> The sets and the artistic directors offer a saving grace to the film. Some sets are colorful and some scenes are pretty cool (without actors). <br /> <br /> The old lady of the magic potion? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song contained in the film. Totally inappropriate for a vintage film shot about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered a "big budget" in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie. This just proves that money does not necessarily make a good movie (or even a mediocre film). <br /> <br /> I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets save the movie an evaluation. 2 out of 10
