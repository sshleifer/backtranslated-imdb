Here is one of those movies ruined by the insistence of the studio on a happy ending. The conflicts that have been going on for years are resolved in minutes. It would have been much more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is defeated by a sudden metamorphosis of an independent and assertive woman into a complacent woman of the kind she has crushed all her life. Brent, as usual, is way above his head and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young playing the character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears but Gig Young, the actor! It is worth seeing well below what it could have been.
