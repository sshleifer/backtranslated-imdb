I wish I could give this film a zero. Effects of cheese and acting. The only reason to see this movie is for you to see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid who plays Brian. What a geek! I could not believe the mullet! Then there was the talk to himself. I guess they could not just let the movie shut up, but still. Of course, they had to see him soaking, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave an excellent performance compared to the special effects department. All I could do, from the bear to the crash, was something I could do myself and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production, since the film was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer ever read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a stinky goat!
