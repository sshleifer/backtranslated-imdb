As expectations were low, the new opening sequence of "Husbands" (more than five minutes) was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new footage is Category A material, but it provides a very solid foundation for what "could have been" a good, totally original movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was set up in 1955, during a day at set times. After the new images, Jules White decided to simply insert archive footage of "Brideless Groom" in this short film, thus creating a not so sweet narrative transition that Jules and Felix Adler are trying to remedy the end situation, giving us the old, worn-out boys (Moe and Larry in this case) getting shot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
