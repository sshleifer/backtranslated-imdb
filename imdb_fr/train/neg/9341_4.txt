This Hal Roach short comedy, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. In short, a showcase of the black comic Stepin Fetchit that gets a special bill here, we see him go to his hut where the gang stands. Farina gets a love letter from the mail for him and Stepin asks him to read it because he can not read it during the day while he goes to NIGHT school. This comes from his girlfriend Tennesse, so Farina must have his ears stuffed with cotton, because it's too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer hands Mary Ann with instructions on how to make the radio shot, but as he continues to run in the kitchen, he misses the presenter's pass to the rice pudding and Spanish tamale that confuses Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! Once the preparation is over, Jackie and the rest of the group help themselves with this awful but very tacky substance, because everyone is stuck on the walls. While they are all trying to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various electrical lines and outlets that combine various device features, such as a vacuum phone, a hoover and a music fridge. ! The end. What I have just described suggests the sinuous nature of this short film "Our group" which served as a pilot for a possible series of short films by Stepin Fetchit. It's as good as it ever happened, because the characterization of the sluggish negro by Fetchit was amusing only in small doses and would be considered very shocking today. Most of the scenes I just described are good for laughter, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too disappointing for me. So, in summary, a difficult winter is a curiosity to see at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
