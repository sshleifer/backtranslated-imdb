Almost everything in this movie is fake, fake, fake. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his days at SNL more than ten years ago. He makes the same cute jokes and voices. Her cat is painfully unfriendly. He tries too hard. He's a funny type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cutouts for the backdrop would have made more sense than building a whole neighborhood and a main street.) Alec Balwin tries to give a funny impression of Great Santini, but he ends up seeming incoherent. There is even a moment of inappropriate cheesecake with the fake celebrity Paris Hilton - which stays in the head just because this is supposed to be a story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this movie at all costs, guys. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams, and then we'll have Seuss' bad trilogy with a movie starring a comedian.)
