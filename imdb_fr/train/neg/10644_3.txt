Well, here we still have another role reversal movie. There was plenty to watch, despite the tired plot of gender reversal. However, this one is not. In previous reviews, I think I fully explained the general decline in the enjoyment of Haim's films that followed the late eighties. That's one of them. <br /> <br /> "Just One of the Girls" talks about a young high school student (Corey Haim) who tries to avoid bullying by disguising herself as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading team and befriends his colleague cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not continue the charade any longer. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was shit, and it was not even funny. But, judging by the majority of the critics, it seems that the fans of Alanis Morrisette or the queen of adolescent sexual relations, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who want to watch it. If you're looking for a good feature of Haim (or a role-change comedy), look no further than 1989. That's about the point that Haim's career has marked.
