I've seen a change of purpose ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... we see Olsen twins doing the same movie ... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with boys. .... first of all, such little boys and girls do not play on such goals ... 2. Football does not play with the time allotted ... 3.If the game is over, the referee gives a few extra hours (a minute or more) ... and the end is so expected .... I think this film is bad because of lack of knowledge about football ... if it was done by European producers it would be better ... and more, the actors of the mane are not the good choice ... they suffer from a lack of authenticity..OK they played a few seasons in full house but it does not make them big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what Olsen binoculars are missing
