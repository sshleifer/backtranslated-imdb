Dil is a memorable film that brings to celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The film followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti, all of whom were superb. <br /> <br /> But then, every successful director gives some horrible movies with some success. Pyare Mohan is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are nicely told, they then fail in laughter. If you really want to watch a movie and laugh about it, please do not watch that. Because pathetic comedy will make you cry only. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is worth it.
