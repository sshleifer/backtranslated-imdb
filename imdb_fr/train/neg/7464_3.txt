I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after half an hour of viewing and I suggest to anyone watching it to stop before taking out the disc. <br /> <br /> I love Mafia movies both tragic and comic, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic mafia comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano just tries too much to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange manners appear to be artificial - Chris Kattan "acts clearly" rather than playing a role - he makes you go out of the story. Each scene is quite predictable, the "comic event" that will occur on the set is evident as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean, the disasters caused by the main character are fun because you can understand the motivations of the characters and the initial event, and the situation in which the character is located is not telegraphed. Corky, however, gives the impression that he is deliberately mistaken in a desperate attempt to make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> If Chris had not played such a strange character (who never really connects with others film) and whose behavior is totally inexplicable (apart from trying to pull laughter) and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed all too familiar), this movie could have been watched. But it's not. Do not look at him.
