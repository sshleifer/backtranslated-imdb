This film is a flagrant swindle of one of the best novels of all time, George Eliot's Silas Marner. <br /> <br /> The details of the movie shown on IMDb recognize the original author but I did not see that at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying "suggested by the book Silas Marner ". Suggested? It was nothing more than a complete scam of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> An unhappy old man sad, a craftsman, poor and lonely, is robbed all his sound money. One night, a child walks to his door while his mother is dying in the snow. The man takes it and brings it to the day the local knight (or the rich politician here) asks to adopt the child. It is he who fathered the child in an illicit case several years ago. The battle ensues to determine who should have legal custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this aspect and in all other aspects of the film, the story is exactly the same. In one case, I can find a difference. Silas Marner was suffering from epilepsy, but perhaps that would have put a strain on Mr. Martin's abilities. On top of that, he has dyed hair in a mixture of carrot juice (presumably to give it a younger look, but in reality to make it look more clown than it is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian can not resist the idea of ​​introducing into history a story that does not participate in it and that only hurts the depth of the story. history. Like when the child cries in court declaring that she can only be happy with the man who fathered her during all these years. This is what the girl says that applies a nasal decongestant on the bridge of the nose to make her cry! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the legality and integrity of the film industry make it possible to make such a film. If I were a director of George Eliot, I would insist on getting compensation. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the benefits to this estate or the poor. At the very least, it should be called Silas Marner - adapted by S. Martin. Or even better, still removed from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - spread it out completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation in the 1980s.
