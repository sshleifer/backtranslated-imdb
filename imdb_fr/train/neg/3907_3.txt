I'm glad I rented this movie for a reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and know the whole story. <br /> <br /> Advantages: the film is beautiful, the period is well described (to my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do good work. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: This is the worst acting job I have ever seen Jeremy Irons - I was wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he talks about "Transito".) Winona Ryder does not do anything trustworthy, other than looking young and idealistic. Most other performances are acceptable, but so few things stand in the arches of characters and in the development of the relationship that I was frustrated and pissed off well before the end. <br /> <br /> I'm very curious to know if this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to drop a few extra dollars to rent Sense of Snow from Smilla.
