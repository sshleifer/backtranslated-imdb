It is hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder once made the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976). with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, an independent and independent criminal investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy. Together, they form an uncomfortable duet. It's not good, when two unbalanced college clerks (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them in pursuit of the wild goose - by filing very intelligent and deceptive forensic evidence on a crime scene. and Chaplin fail to create sparks, we must also experience several deaf and melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Cass's story. Then, of course, there are frequent shots of a log cabin at the edge of a cliff where there is absolutely no doubt that the end of the OTT crossing will be settled. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Look at any episode of CSI instead. It's at the point and much more exciting.
