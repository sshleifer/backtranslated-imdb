I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember its title, while I was reviewing horror movies, I found it and thought to myself "this is the title? " This film is a kind of combination disaster film / insect attack movie with less notable stars. It's also a little boring too, because there's this TV atmosphere where you can see the movie gradually disappearing for commercials and the like. The plot has this kind of station being invaded by ants. I think they have been a little disturbed by the construction or something happening nearby, but do not quote me about it. The most memorable ants attack for me in the entire movie is the first involving the child who falls into the pool after being overwhelmed by the crowd and of course, the Summers attack scene. What is remarkable in this one is the very clumsy end where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, like most TV movies, this film is very tame and not very scary at all, unless you panic at the sight of ants.
