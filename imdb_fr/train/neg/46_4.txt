I am looking for this film for centuries, because it is quite rare to find it because it was one of the bad creations of the video. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year. It's a low budget movie. The story unfolds around tribes of the Amazon jungle who live in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who was kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her to the jungle Laura is guarded by a ridiculous native who calls himself "the devil". She must go through all the unpleasant things until they are happy. The girls are chained. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible way. Peter Weston, is the devil's hunter, who goes to the jungle to try to save her,
