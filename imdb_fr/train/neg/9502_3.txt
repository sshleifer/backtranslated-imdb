This film was bizarre, completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. I love the first movies with Lisa getting lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in an exotic European environment, but maybe not in a low budget horror movie. There is no doubt that the strangely nonsex sex scenes were cut (in my DVD copy). Do not try to understand it, go ahead and watch for the strange elements ... that are everything. Do not look at it if you really want plot, characterization or something else to make sense. Very nice, although you can just abandon that and decide to watch a horror movie, like, for example, Dead Alive.
