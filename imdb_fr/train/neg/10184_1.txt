For months, I heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute to see how many new filmmakers are making movies where they combine the creative ideas of others to create their own joke principle. Troops, Swingblade, one of millions of parodies of Blair Witch come to mind. If all these filmmakers want is a foot in the door of Hollywood, they act as they should and they should keep it, because the combination of contours of the plot is the way Hollywood produces movies. How many times have you heard the following phrase: "It's Animal House and Back to the Future"; "Wall Street meets the society of the dead poet"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember the days when independent films meant original and daring, neither safe nor predictable.
