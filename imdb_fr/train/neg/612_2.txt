As for the B-movie series, SCARECROW is one of those who are so bad that it becomes extremely annoying to sit still. A lonely and losing high school student who is constantly being harassed by his classmates and rejected by the girls ends up entering his trash, his mother having sex with a drunken redneck. He then hunts the kid in a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the souls of the children have been transferred to a scarecrow who kills the tyrants who tormented him and the teachers. This scarecrow, besides the fact that it has a single live line for each of its victims, can also make Matrix-type turnarounds in the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Just like the two useless suites that followed, it's not even worth laughing at.
