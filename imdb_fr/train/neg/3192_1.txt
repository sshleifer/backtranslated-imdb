What the critics and MST3K have left out is the best part (and the only memorable scene) of this terrifying movie: as mentioned, later killed by TJ's unsuitability). Maybe rape is too strong a word, "mating ritual in prison" may be more appropriate. The context behind this chance, but a forced encounter, is the gangster who hides "Ben Gazzara", presents it to the girls who hang out in his swimming pool. The blonde of about thirty despairs, but our scoundrel must be completely in love with her, because the parade is initiated at that time. Her first gesture is to try to drown her, until her mafia benefactor tells her to bring him down. A bit like the high school girl you did not like, but who still wanted to have a carnal knowledge anyway ... Let's just say that he catches her later in the cabin.
