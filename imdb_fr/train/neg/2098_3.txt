I was hoping to get detailed background information on the Apollo 11 mission and got decent interviews with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and others involved in the mission, linked by a sensationalistic disaster-prone voice - in the worst tradition television production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut the voice-over and change the turn of the program into a positive testimony about how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal that could have been great - but I feel that I lost about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60-minute program. I want to recover those minutes.
