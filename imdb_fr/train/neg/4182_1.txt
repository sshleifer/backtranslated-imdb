This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I'm used to seeing CGI gray blobs and amateur special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or another variation of the syrup. However, I thought I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi chain could reach. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand inside an enameled rubber sock with syrup? These are the main exotic vampires of this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubber sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of the victims and the vampire, who is part of the vampire hunter team, can talk to these rubber puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And is not it Transylvania in Romania? So, should not they speak Romanian? Why would a small town have its own language? If you can suspend your nauseated reflex and go beyond the rubber socks, the fingers move clearly in the heads of the aliens; then you have to deal with other extraterrestrial vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are those who are just ugly and who all seem to have a lot of scars on their faces. Then there are the Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies to sabotage defense systems so that space vampires can attack. <br /> Finally, if you all think. The above is fun and deserves a little laugh. You have to deal with the distribution of third-class TV offspring that make up this team of angry stereotypical heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why do almost all Sci-Fi movies have to use annoying, abrasive, brutal or simply unattractive characters? I found myself hoping that the talking rubber socks would win.
