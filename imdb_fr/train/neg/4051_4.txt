Lindsay Anderson was truly a European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker made spectacular films with a visual vision. Anderson's film is more focused on social commentary and subtext, so the message often ends up winning. on all the film whose main function should be to entertain the public <br /> <br /> What you think of the IF is what you think of British filmmakers. I strongly agree that cinema should be a universal means (the best British film is the one that tries to imitate Hollywood in my opinion), if you want to send a message, try pony express, and I find the movie dated, pretentious and over regulated in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France. You can imagine all the French leftists worshiping this film, especially the climax. French filmmakers of the new wave will also admire the abstract surrealism of certain scenes, but a large international audience will not like it, and many will love it intensely.
