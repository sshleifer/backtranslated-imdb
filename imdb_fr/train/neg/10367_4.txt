This film was poorly written, badly played and very predictable. It was a very small budget and I can understand why it was never published and went straight to the video. It was not even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could recover the 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were horrible with the plot that has holes so big that you could drive a mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself prompted the bride to do things she was absolutely not physically able to do - what an effort! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about every film that comes to mind is better than that. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
