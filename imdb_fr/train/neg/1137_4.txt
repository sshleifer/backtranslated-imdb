I tried twice to get through this movie, getting it right the first time - and it was like getting my teeth - and failing a second time despite an excellent DVD transfer. The problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can go to the dramatic courtroom, which occupies most of the second half of the movie, you've already done it, but it's hard to get to that point . "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) made interesting presentations during the trial. The end is touching as Lincoln moves away and superimposes his memorial statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful story, well played, etc., but lacks spark in the first period and discourages. the spectator to hang out there. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
