I saw this film with low expectations and I was not disappointed. Its so bad that it's really funny in a very dignified way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean he just can not act, point to point. He should give up now, playing is not his thing .. His co-stars are about the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than them! The director should be ashamed to put his name on something so ridiculous. I do not think there is an Oscar for this guy. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do it. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, do not settle for 0/10 if there was a 0
