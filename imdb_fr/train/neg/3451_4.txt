Frank Sinatra was far from being the ideal actor for westerns. He was a great actor. From Here to Eternity and The Man with the Golden Arm are proof of this, but he did not have the physique of a Western hero, you identified him as an urban type. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people were hoping for a certain model, to get out of it, the film must be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that an entire city will allow Sinatra to do everything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Moreover, when a man shows him a special case that will open to the side, he must not draw the weapon. You wonder if this makes him invincible, why did not all the fighters adopt him? I think this film should not have been removed, because any film with Sinatra is worth the detour, and despite its flaws, it remains pleasant
