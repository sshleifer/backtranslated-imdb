How cynical are the writers, so to speak. I may be an American citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans caressing each other for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am surprised that so few people commented on how the dialogue in this film is really jingois, sentimental and banal. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as crude and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British submariners into Americans), but you're still a little sticky. Really, the Germans of this film only admire the Americans between battle scenes! It's sad, useless! I would just like to say to the authors: It is obvious to many of us that you can not capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you have used very well-tested shortcuts. Fortunately for you, there will always be crazy nationalists to appreciate your guts coated with sugar.
