Even if being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me insightful insight, I do not know what was done for the first time there ... and what ended on the screen. I remember seeing the original version of "Freshman Freshman" and being very happy. It was funny, sexy, scorching, all the main requirements of a drive-in movie. you must remember that this film was filmed and broadcast before everything else ... pet shop, porcy, etc. for whatever reason, the film was given to the main distributors who put together half of the original film, and then to the film (should I say "mixed?") THE most random scene ever. the fat guy, the people with goat heads .... what was it all about ?! I am sure that additional fees were requested, but the pace was so slow that everything that happened before was upset and caused a sudden and painful stop. but overall, it's a fun memory for me ... mostly because I can say it's the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in it!
