I released this Blockbuster movie in one of those racks where you can have 5 movies for $ 20. I must say that I got my money. I was expecting horrible dialogues, crappy monsters and shaky cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad, although it's not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe I recently watched so many low budget movies that I lost perspective. The acting is downright horrible, but most of the time he has at least one level of play in high school. <br /> <br /> The CG of Sasquatch in this film is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought about when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreeing with me) was that a man in monkey costume would have been better. The clumsy stop-motion animation would have been better. <br /> <br /> You may be wondering why I call CG in second place. This is because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are strong, annoying and constant. I'm camping, I know what insects look like in the woods at night, and although they can be noisy, they're not as deafening as the cacophony of this movie. Usually, when the "background" sounds, the dialogue of the film is drowned, it's a bad thing, but from what I could understand the dialogue of this film, I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The action was infrequent and boring. The tension was nonexistent, as was any empathy for the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all strippers and bland. The only exciting game was between ... in fact, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smile, but that was about it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was correct, a step or two more than what we normally see in a movie like this. However, he still had this quality "home movie" that you get with movies made with a pocket change and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and you love tight-budget movies, and you see this one in the basket of dollars, consider grabbing it. Otherwise, stay at all costs.
