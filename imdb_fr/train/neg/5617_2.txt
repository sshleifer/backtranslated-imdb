This documentary is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming omits, perhaps deliberately, not to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the oldest: his claims about the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ take no account of essential facts, such as: ** The existence of beliefs formulated in Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims to Jesus have already been made in declarations of faith, probably a few years after the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of early Christians can not simply be thrown away as a mere fantasy. There were indeed many who claimed to be the Messiah during this period, but ONE of them remained: Jesus. Why? For it would have been ridiculous for anyone to truly believe that Christ was the messiah and to die for these beliefs if they knew he had not been resurrected. ** Even though the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about Jesus' stories written during the life of other eyewitnesses who reported inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is incredibly biased and selfish work that mixes different arguments and evidence in the service of his antichristian vision. Do not be fooled by a bad investigation.
