If you can believe it, an * other * group of teenagers is going back to * another * lakeside cabin three years later * another * one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of them. Down and here, a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap paper mask anyway) arrives to waste them one by one. This mechanical punch of "Friday the 13th" has gained a notoriety as one of the first digitized functions, but this is where the interesting facts stop and that only a predictable and amateur production remains with poor performance and a recurring micro-boom intrusion. A last second diverts the spirits and it is better to drop the "Memorial Day" in a lake and forget about it. One for insane slasher collectors only.
