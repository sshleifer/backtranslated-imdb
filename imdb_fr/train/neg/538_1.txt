Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, thinking both of them, it must be better, these actresses are too beautiful to have lost their time on this shit. The unattractive characters, the unusual scripts and the lethargic stimulations last two hours. In fact, I could not hack it and went shopping (cat litter was more appealing than this movie). The husband stayed and confirmed that things were not improving - by the time Buddy was killed, you wanted them all to be hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful landscapes and costumes can not keep this one alive.
