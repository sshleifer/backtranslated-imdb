Oh, man, how many series had fallen like in 1952! This boring thing is precisely the kind of soap opera that annoyed Annie Wilkes (Misery). Not only do heroes escape traps by adding scenes that did not exist in the previous chapter (and that CAN NOT be present). Tell me that when the bad guys blow up the plain of episodes 7 to 8, they do not see the characters popping), but I think this series has the World Record Footage record. I mean, most are archive footage! And not just another soap opera (apparently, all the flight sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the "epic" scenes from episode 2 to 3 are from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from him. even! The complete sequence of the "Journey to the Moon" (which is probably the shortest, 30 seconds and the characters never seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) of episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (You've never wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12. Well, they had to stop after 9 hours to avoid having to do it again!). <br /> <br /> Do not get me started on the science factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon ever! And lunar men who can not breathe on their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too talkative and stunts (usually the best in series) are rare and distant. On a visual level, am I the only one who thinks that the Commando Cody's bullet-shaped (or lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous? The Rocketeer was a lot cooler, no matter how bad the movie was (and the man, was it awful). The car-like vehicle is not much better, it seems that a group of children did it for Halloween. The only positive thing that I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is a simple man instead of the usual muscular nice piece (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But it is so unattractive ... <br /> <br /> Do not even bother to be watched for nostalgia reasons. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, see Memorable Quotes for a Real Lib for Women).
