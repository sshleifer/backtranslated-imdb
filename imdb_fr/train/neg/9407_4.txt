"Houseboat Horror" is often considered to be the worst Australian film ever made and is described as a typical slasher film with the "See the film that can not win an Academy Award" promotion. A member of the underground disco band begins to die dead by burning maniac while they were trying to shoot a music video on an isolated lake in western Australia.Badly played and written slick movie with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly delivers the gore: heads are divided in two with a machete, the throat is cut off and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like cheese slasher films, you can try this one, but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
