It's one of the worst cinematographic adaptations of a musical comedy ever made. The scenic version of A Chorus Line is beautiful. This film misses the target in almost every way. Even the casting is confusing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. The story of Val is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the department of looks. Yes, she finds a solution, but in the end, she is an excellent dancer. What do brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is known for her beauty. Missing the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning in his grave. Why did not they use his choreography? It really can not be improved.
