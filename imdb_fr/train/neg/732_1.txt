A young boy sees his mother being killed and his father hanging himself. 20 years later, he gathered a group of friends to engage in an exorcism so as not to become like his father. All the characters are in place: the beautiful couple; the "funny" guy; the hard (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know); the nerd and two blondes without personality. Everything involves a stupid wooden statue that comes alive (does not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a big opening scene, we jump to 20 years later - ALL the bad horror movies do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And the murders are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is where two people are supposed to have sex and the statue hits the guy in bed to show him he's all dressed up! A real bad stupid and incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
