I can not help it, but I seem to like movies that are supposed to scare and that are just bad. I have personally listed it in my top 10 worst movies under the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and have fun, but do not expect to receive academic rewards for your performance. More chance to understand the film itself. In all honesty, I have seen much worse than that. In addition, a little madman who walks the desert wiping the same people who have just died is as incredible as it must be original. I think it's one of those movies of love or hate. you can make up your own mind, yes, it's awful, but it pulls it somehow, that's why I like it
