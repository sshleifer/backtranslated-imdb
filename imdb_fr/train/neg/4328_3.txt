Any movie titled "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely sure to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and elsewhere in Germany.It may be an institution in the United States, but it is virtually unknown in Europe. "National Lampoon's European holidays" should not remedy this situation. The frightful Griswald are just that - frightful. They are not funny. Obviously, Mr. Chevy Chase finds it funny, after all, Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot of her jokes, but she is paid for it and does not have to shell out £ 2.50 to benefit from this privilege. The section taking place in England is typical. The same old TV artists, MM. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman are coming out of the same old clichés, Mr. Chase getting lost in the hallway of the hotel .... yawn, yawn, yawn .. Bucking ham Palace, Big Ben .... .. I feel cheated that we have never seen bobbies on two by two bikes ......... red cheeks rosie on the little kid - I need to keep going? The English are jesters, the French are mean, they hate the language. The Germans are pompous and inflated (do not mention the war, Clark), and the Italians are tireless. Have you forgotten anything? Every possible "comic" situation is worked to death, Mr. Chase whimpered desperately, Mlle di Angelo turned pale, the children were terribly bad. The fact that this franchise has lasted so long should reassure those who argue that you never lose money by underestimating the public's tastes.
