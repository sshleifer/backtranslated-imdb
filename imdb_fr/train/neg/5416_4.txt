This is the third effort of director von Stroheim. It is rather brutal and does not show the exceptional flair for the mastery of the camera and editing that he would display a few years later with his masterpieces GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. We have basically a trio of scribes, pretending to be a Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money at gaming tables and make a fortune. Part of this plan is for the count (von Stroheim) to insinuate himself between a visiting American ambassador and his "crazy" wife, courting her and hoping to earn some money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of also taking the savings of the maid's life, with which he promised to get married. When she sees them together, she sets the room on fire (von Stroheim and her prey are on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroheim first establishes his personality as "the man you love to hate." He is completely bad and his character flaws finally lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is rude in its cinematography and editing and is only worth seeing if you are fascinated by the director. There's a cute little detail: when he tries to meet the ambassador's wife for the first time, she reads a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. It was originally thought of as a 210-minute film, reduced to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. The restoration on Kino Video restores the surviving images (damaged in one way or another in most scenes) of the previous alternative version to give us a 107-minute impression.
