I think I laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about being on the street. And then I forget the other time I laughed. It was probably early. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the thinnest films of all time. Does not Hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, really? You can only insult you so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
