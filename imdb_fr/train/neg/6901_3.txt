The most positive thing I can say for this dull "comedy" production is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so surprisingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of rewrites have been conducted by a committee to obtain such a withdrawal from his personality. It's not spiritual, it's not entertaining, it's not insightful and it's not charming. It's just a serene and unequivocal progression of four losers who must change their habits and their attitude towards women to be able to attend the wedding of their best friend. <br /> <br /> In such a role, the situation would be mediocre. local amateur theater company, a plot so tired that it would make a forty-third season of "Allo" Allo, and jokes as humorous as watching decaying vegetables, Sione's Wedding nevertheless recorded ten (yes 10) nominations in the NZ movie Recently, awards. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone understood common sense and did not win any.
