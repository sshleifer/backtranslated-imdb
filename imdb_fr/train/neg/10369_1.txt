As a writer, I find that movies are so bad that production is a total slap. Talk about insulting. I wrote better stories than this in grade 8. Bad play, bad writing, wrong direction and once all added, the result is a total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is to entice the unsuspecting consumer to waste his time. Who would want to light something so badly written? It's not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, suspensive, mysterious, scary, dramatic-NOTHING. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring, without development. The plot is also recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to put together some very familiar actors who must all be desperate for work or hope that one of these low-budget independent films will prove to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to line up a birdcage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and most importantly, a woman weighing 5'2 and 105 lbs naturally has the strength to kill men and women twice as big as her size, without a fight and in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if it would infect you with an STD.
