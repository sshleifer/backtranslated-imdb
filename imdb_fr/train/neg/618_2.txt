Perhaps one of the worst teen slasher films I have ever seen. I'll start with the disadvantages of the film, which covers almost the entire film. First of all, there is something that no one can avoid: a terrible action. I swear they picked up random kids on the street based on their appearance. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCING CARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You know only half of the children who are killed here. All you think is that they deserved it in one way or another. The character of the scarecrow was exaggerated and represented a cheap scam of other great fantastic killers such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: The Scarecrow was filled with horrible linings that would make you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find little animals to torture!" really just leave you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next stop: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his bald head for God's sake. I could say a lot more about this film, for example about the cheap special effects, about the efforts of the "high school cinema class", but the point is understood. It's just a bad film making at worst. As for what I found to be "good" in the movie: -A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
