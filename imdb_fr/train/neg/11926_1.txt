I am rarely moved to make such comments BUT, after watching most of Rankin's dreadful movies, I feel like I really won the right to say how I feel! I really could not get to the end and I became one of the half-dozen or more (about a third of the audience) after the torn intrigue, a deplorable dialogue and an insulting characterization became too difficult to support. this film is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. it is weighed down by a dreadful acting game, a truly dramatic scenario, an indifferent cinematography and production values ​​at the student level. How it was funded, started and finished is a mystery to me. I bet you a million dollars, he never goes into general freedom. the appropriate critics would tear it up. a very bad movie. shockingly bad. a really really poor effort AND without even mentioning the free time of the new-born-kitten-let-yourself-in-a-big-deep-fryer-fryer. totally meaningless, quite light, badly put in place; this film is a terrible embarrassment for British cinema.
