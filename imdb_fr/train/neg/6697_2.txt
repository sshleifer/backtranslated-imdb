Crazy rifle-to-revenge rage in search of truck drivers and obsessive control disorder "Dad raped me while I cuffed" that can be easily viewed on any cable TV channel (IE : Skinemax) at 4 in the morning on Sunday evening. (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but I did not know anything, it's a long criticism for a useless short film). <br /> <br /> Filmed in "somewhere" in Canada, with almost no budget, the plot of this monster show is trivial, the police have obviously never heard of "jurisdictional" because she eventually sued Miya (Hookers) and Trent (silly, student, academic, insecure) all over the United States (and I thought only the FBI could do it). The camera is unstable, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so serious that it could result in unintended flashbacks in movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> Regarding the scenes of Skin go (which is the only reason to rent this movie, do not even think to buy it), there are two. The first is the only one worth watching but that is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert an unknown actor here, he obviously did not do anything interesting) in a disgusting motel room drop drop, and the soda machine outside that has only blue tonic water left). Everything is S & M (whip, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear licking) and in the end he is left in a motel room, without money and cops at his door (it'll show you guys, do not leave a prostitute tying you to a motel room "in the middle of nowhere"). Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin that is worth remembering, and this alone can cause deep traumatic experiences with seeds for some gentlemen, so this is really a negative point for this movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would not mind if I told you but I would not, you should spend your hard earned money on the one -the. In summary, I give him a 1/5 for the action, a 3/5 for Skin (see last paragraph) and a 0/0 for the acting, character development or complicated twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
