Bad conspiracy, bad dialogue, bad acting, silly realization, the boring soundtrack of porn groove that constantly turned on the old-fashioned scenario, and a copy of the VHS that sucks can not be redeemed by consuming alcohol . Believe me, I stuck this turkey all the way. It was so pathetic that I had to think it was a parody of the spring for Hitler. The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only spark of interest, it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at something similar, but a thousand times better, then look beyond the valley of the dolls.
