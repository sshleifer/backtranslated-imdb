The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it's a perfect example of movies in which Al Pacino should avoid playing. My first major complaint was the way Pacino tried to represent a Georgian accent; sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. The dialogue and the interaction between the characters were terrible with a weak plot. The actors did an extremely superficial job of keeping the film interesting and, after an hour, I still saw no sign of a solid plot. The story is boring overall, and I had to slap myself several times to stay awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bother you too ... to avoid at all costs.
