a film that tries to be much smarter than its directors are able to produce. the film runs through the "surprises" of the miriad plot in a desperate attempt to let the audience guess, leaving behind a twisted "scenario" with torrid scenes that they thought would help him. <br /> <br /> james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep travels through the movie. the same goes for the other "actors". the plot is pretty stupid and sticky. In itself, it's not such a crime, but towards the end, the huge scenario intrigues become very boring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film manages to arouse some interest in the middle. All in all, it's worth watching on a really boring day, but do not worry if you miss this one. <br /> <br /> A 4 rather nil!
