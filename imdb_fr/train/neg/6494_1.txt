I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see what he would do as a writer / director. I could not have been more disappointed with this move. The film was so disjointed and the film so much finished that I wanted to unplug the wall. The actors were very good but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors are made to be screenwriters or directors, and Mr. Hopkins is clearly in this category. Of all the movies I've seen in my 50s, it's absolutely the worst movie of all time. Please, let us all please Mr. Hopkins and stick to the act, for which you are excellent, and let the writing and the realization to those who have talent in these fields. If I could give this film a score lower than one, that would certainly be the case.
