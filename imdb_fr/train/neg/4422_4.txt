This one is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered girl of an ambitious politician who has to prove to Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he deserves to be supported as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere, but she is surrounded by politicians and their shaking women trembling, supported only by the kind uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two daughters at a blind meeting and Gary Cooper arrives by chance. Some rodeo shots might have animated things, like "Misfits", but that luck did not happen. Later, Gary takes part in an official dinner chaired by Merle. He is invited to sit down and join the group and reads a lecture on their snobbery. Where did the sudden eloquence of this shy cowboy come from? The most horrendous scene in the movie is a ghostly party Gary organizes in his unfinished house for his missing wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
