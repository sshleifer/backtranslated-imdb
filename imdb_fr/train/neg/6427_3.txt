So I found this documentary strange and really useless. I know he has received awards and other things, but personally, I did not appreciate it too much. there was no humor or drama to interest you, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some people are quite different, which is not a bad thing, it just did not leave a good impression. I was really bored with this movie, without wishing to offend my creative writing teacher. The circus theme was pretty cool throughout the movie, but I did not understand it, and robotics and taming lions are definitely not my thing. the green animals were cool, I really liked the garden full of colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? I really did not understand why someone would make a movie about it. But if you like such things, you could enjoy it. who am I to keep you on your way. I simply warn you of possible suffering.
