This film goes from 4th to 1st place without worrying about the 3rd or the 2nd, leading straight to perfection to the dark finish line and beta. The con at the beginning is easily the smartest and most intelligent part of the movie. This is worth the detour. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is happening so fast that you may miss it. It's really not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed marginal society turn out to be saints - especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
