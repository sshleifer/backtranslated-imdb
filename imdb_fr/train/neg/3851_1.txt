I had never thought of seeing a movie that was worse than "Lisa Picard is Famous", but it came very close. As was often repeated throughout the comments, it was predictable. Five minutes after the beginning of the film, you know that the result will be different. The film refers to / painfully torn everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther." Writer Greg Glienna (Meeting Parents) Needs New Elements. <br /> <br /> The only peculiarity is the deranged boyfriend / police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even this opportunity is lost. Many of the Seattle Space Needle's plans are needed to hide the obvious Canadian locations. Some of the worst driving conditions in car scenes make almost no effort to conceal the fact that the car is pulled into town by a trailer. Damn, at least, turn the steering wheel or apply the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and her short haircut is a crime. $ 3 million to Jason Lee, for what? Guess, it's worth the skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So here should see this film: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' evil; People who can not get enough of Julia Stiles. 1/10
