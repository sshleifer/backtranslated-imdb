I do not like this film, but I did not think much about the book, which, although hailed by many as a "masterpiece", lacked character development and a disjointed and illogical plot. that it was much more readable than Fante's first frightening "Road to Los Angeles" effort, which was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> J I was intrigued to see what sort of soup would prepare Towne with such lean ingredients. He worked hard in the script to fix the book's many shortcomings, but my money did not save him. There has never been a movie in Ask the Dust as long as he has tried to stay true to the book. I consider this film Towne's Madness. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgettable.
