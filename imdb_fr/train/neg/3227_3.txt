This is a payment from the notorious Guinea pig series. A short-lived Japanese TV show, which was canceled after a psychopath confessed to being inspired by the murder of a young schoolgirl. This short film of the series is, like all the other films in the series, virtually without history. A group of guys captured a young woman. They tie her up and torture her to death by filming her. They beat her, poured boiling oil on her, used tongs, and finally, "loving" in close-up, passed a needle through her eye. It's the simplest of all the movies about the guinea pig, and one of the first. It is probably this film, more than any other film, that gave the guinea pig the rumor of a snuff. They certainly inspired the film "8 mm" by Nicolas Cage. These films have become very popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more refined but equally graphic films, such as "Naked Blood". They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies, which have been lightly cleaned up and become reality shows. Not recommended, but will probably seduce those who will see something else once, and wonder why after, I know I did it.
