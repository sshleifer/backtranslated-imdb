Yes, MTV really exists a way to market Daria. What began as an intelligent adolescent anguish - "comment on anything that is nil and reassure the viewer about her dilapidated teenage life" is now transformed into a sitcom "how to treat your problems". I watched Daria all the time and I loved it. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called "movie", I can only wonder what's the point. Daria tells us how to lead college life? Excuse me? Did not Daria tell every episode that what you like to do is acceptable, as long as you feel good, no matter how sad and sick the rest of the world think? All this reminded me of the scene of "Reality Bites", the movie channel shows the documentary for the first time.
