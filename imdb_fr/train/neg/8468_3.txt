"They are among us" is at best a mediocre science fiction. The mediocre play of the film is bogged down. The holes in the plot are numerous. The extraterrestrials who have fallen to the ground on a meteor and have been hiding among us for more than 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to give them a human aspect. In their extraterrestrial form, they apparently have exo-skeletons (that's why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after the closure of the Blue Book project, but was supposed to be an F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to see a movie about an alien invasion, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see how it goes.
