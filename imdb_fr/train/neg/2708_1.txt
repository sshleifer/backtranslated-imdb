This film masquerades as a social commentary while it is just as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. The principle of this movie: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst is when Rapaport fires a revolver at Omar Epps and a Jew. The stereotypical Jewish guy collapses and begins to argue for his life ... but the big, strong and provocative Omar Epps remains strong without fear. We also condemned each member of the fraternity as a drunkard or arrogant rapist. Of course, the raped female girl begins to consider lesbianism since she is a weak white girl, after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by members of the fellowship, he must of course fall in love with skinheads, who are incredible cowards. especially the big muscular guy who is quickly beaten by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES BAT A GUY TWICE SIZE ??? Yes of course. <br /> <br /> Of course, blacks NEVER reject their people and Omar Epps easily takes them with them. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them online are just stupid - of course he's the dominant one, while his weak roommates sit in awe of him and eventually move out. This movie was just terrible and the end made me laugh out loud. The excessively long idle time between Epps and Banks becomes hilarious with the faces they make - it's like watching my nephew and my cousins ​​make faces (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and pass this crapfest.
