I've been using IMDb for a few years now, but I've never written a review before. However, this film disappointed me so much (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could no longer be silent. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by noise pollution that he takes an alter-ego as a vigilante, "The Rectifier", and vandalize all the cars he finds with an alarm that sounds. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the movie to be a bit of a misnomer. Although one or two examples of other sources of noise are discussed or mentioned, the only real objective of our protagonist is the car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other goal. When the film tries to connect other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be simply added to give credit to the actions of Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by the noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have the same internal desire to bring a baseball bat to a screaming vehicle, and the film uses that fact, and pretty much that alone, to sell that movie. I say "pretty much" because there is also a manifestly artificial sexual relationship (including a totally useless threesome) that is obviously intended for movie buffs who need such things to be able to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it slips into the eyes. <br /> <br /> The character of Robbin, very shortly after his entry into the film, becomes completely implausible. It seems less that he decides to no longer stand the noise, and even more so, focusing so much on the noise, he started to lose his reason. The first half of the film is essentially the story of how he went from an angry guy who was lashing out at the car into a hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not take place. He has just renamed himself. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. Enervating generalized social comments are added from time to time to add to the film's claim, and the satisfied smile that never leaves Robbins's face completely does not help either. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this film is very obvious, because it is thrown in your throat, but in my opinion, it fails a lot. Just a guy's opinion, cheers.
