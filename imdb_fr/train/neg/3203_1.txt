Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL), a roast fire, is the star of this dull and banal action movie as a substitute for Geronimo, a big gassy bastard sitting in a stupid cowboy costume, listening to the Country music and eating too much donuts. Meanwhile, a vaguely criminal type named Palermo (played by the owner of the exercise in GATES OF HELL of Fulci), discovers the territory of Joe Don and films the sheriff in a badly mounted scene. Joe Don, slowly, continues and offers the brother of Palermo after saying his now legendary slogan: "It's up to you to play, do you think you can take me?" Well, go for some reason, Joe Don, a Texan's lawman is to transport Palermo to Italy ("Mr Palermo has been a major source of embarrassment for the Italian government," says Mr Wilson, another loose character played by Bill McKinney, who was in MASTER NINJA. , SHE FREAK, and many good Clint Eastwood movies). <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don's plane must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz, and that's where the film stops.For the rest of the film, Joe Don is looking for Palermo, loses Palermo, finds himself in a prison cell, gets the Maltese police chief bawls, then is put on notice with the warning not to look for Palermo, and then Joe Don continues to search for Pale rme, loses Palermo, finds himself in a prison cell, gets bawled by the Malta police chief, and is put on notice with the warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don searches for Palermo, loses Palermo, finds himself in a prison cell, is shouted by the head of the Malta police, and is put on notice with the warning to no longer search Palermo. It's an aggravating film. <br /> <br /> At some point, Joe Don is thought to have died at sea. All the other characters are wondering if he is dead or not, finally concluding that he is. But then he shows up (he was saved by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. Even his adorable guy, Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque does not welcome back. However, she proposes to help her find Palermo. Joe Don searches for Palermo, loses him, finds himself in a prison cell, gets bawled by the Maltese police chief, then lets him go with the warning not to search More Palermo. <br /> <br /> Among the highlights, a strange carnival with strange colored floats, sexy strippers, a shooting involving a child dressed like Napoleon AND a cart of tomatoes, a stagecraft hunting scene a guy dressed in a monk and any scene without Joe Don. Low points include Joe Don threatening a stripper with a hanger. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this comes from Greydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, who appears as the sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
