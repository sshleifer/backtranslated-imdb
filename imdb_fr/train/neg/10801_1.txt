Now, I'm one to watch movies that have had bad reviews and say, "Hmm ... it's not that bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was awesome. Remember, I really did not start looking at this with high hopes, but I thought maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no time of my suffering through this "film" (and I use this term sparingly), I almost even got a little entertained. For starters, Shaq gives Quentin Tarantino the appearance of Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap, but as far as I know, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than him. The main character is just annoying, and not an easy-to-love character. Quite frankly, I'd rather eat a fat dung from the bloody wounds of a Harlequin fetus than look at that again.
