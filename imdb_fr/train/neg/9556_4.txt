This film is mainly composed of hunting scenes and special effects. He is very weak on the plot. Most of the computer conversation was just gibberish. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, based mostly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This film did not have any of that. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic about real computers and networks, but simply lame. It's like it's written by someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> The game Ripley was bad and was basically an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the purpose? The movie was boring. Blade continued.
