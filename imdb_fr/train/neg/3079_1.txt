My favorite quote from Crow was, when the car was off the top of the cliff, "The movie is so bad that even the car wants to come out!" <br /> <br /> It must have been the funniest movie I have ever seen. It was seriously there to scare you, which makes it even more fun! Without the science of mystery theater, I would not be here today! :-P
