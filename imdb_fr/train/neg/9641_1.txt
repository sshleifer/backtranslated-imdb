If you watch this movie, you're either a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found it on a shelf at $ 4.99 at Suncoast and you thought "what should I lose?", Or you turned in the video store with eyes closed and rented the first movie that your finger touched. <br /> <br /> This film is hysterically bad. There's everything a film needs: a storyline of mind-blowing dialogues and confusing twists in the plot, a zany science involving visionaries and other dimensions, a continuity that seems to go through wormholes in time and space, actors not only in wood, but there seems to be a gratuitous and confused nudity (that's not all you would necessarily ask for), and of course, a 5-minute monster played by this that I suppose to be Fred Olen Ray's kid. <br /> <br /> Underneath, however, there's something like heart-as if Mickey and Judy had decided to reunite all the neighborhood kids and make a monster movie (hey, my father can lead, yeah, we can use red paint from my johnny's dad's hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can play it!). <br /> <br /> Watch the headlines that bother the credits - you'll know why the final cut of the movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Biohazard II ... the Extraterrestrial Force is also worth the detour, but does not make it have the same veneer pleasantly null than this one.
