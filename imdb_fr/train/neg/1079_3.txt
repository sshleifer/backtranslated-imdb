I feel like I'm the only kid in town who's been bored by Branagh's performance. He is a good actor according to most accounts, but he just could not remove the Southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous critics asked why American actors were not chosen in this film. I second this notion. It's wonderful when actors want to broaden their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard for performance to become tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a good director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not really want to criticize Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent. Everyone deserves to screw up here and there. But it's hard to watch something as boring as you'd rather choke on with a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of shit than to miss out on The Gingerbread Man.
