Oh my God, what an idiotic movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by a guy in lame costume) and a stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they I'm just ridiculous For example, I have never seen characters as annoying as in this junk (these idiot children or this pregnant woman with her husband and many others). It's great entertainment if you're drunk. Avoid it like the plague. Am I drunk? I do not believe ...
