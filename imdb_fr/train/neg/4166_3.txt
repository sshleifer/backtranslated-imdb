Loss of total time ... This film is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance ... not even comedy for teenagers, at least! A story ... it should be a bit of a U-turn ... but it's so disappointing! When the film has a turn-over at the end, I expect the turn-over to make the film even better (exp "Fight Club"), but this turnaround makes the film even worse ... When I Look at a comedy for a teenager, I do not expect that very often, I expect lousy jokes and a lot of nudity ... The jokes are too ugly and there is no nudity .. You only have one ... very beautiful, I must admit ... girl, and that's it! And she is fully dressed all the movie! Acting is bad ... like a series of soaps ... Do not waste your time! There are porn with a better story and actors! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
