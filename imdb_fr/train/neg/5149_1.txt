This film tells the story of a rape woman / comics writer from New York who decided to move away from all the glamor of this awful city and settle in a dirty and dilapidated little town where she found refuge in a simple caravan much in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, but so are they for inviting madmen into their caravan. The fact that she has the ability to do exactly what is appropriate to put herself in dangerous circumstances, after dangerous circumstances, is annoying. DB Sweeney's performance was at best in high school. He's one of those cute little actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not good and Mother Nature was at the rendezvous. To the previous commentator that the acting was "so real", well I agree. In fact, it was not acting. The two main characters are truly pathetic, weak and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this film is like no other, praise him for laughing. The real crime scene? The atrocious wooden paneling in the caravan - enough to make me commit murder. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-wide trailer and something other than a yellow Chevy Chevette sun for God's sake!
