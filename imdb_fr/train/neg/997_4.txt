After recently reviewing "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I supported it with "Descent", even though I've heard more negative comments than good movie friends with tastes as varied as mine. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the movie Rape Revenge has evolved over the last 32 years, from the complete gore film "I Spit On Your Grave", to the cheeky sensationalism of "Lipstick". the treatment of the question with taste in "The Accused". But "Downhill", while emphasizing important points, never really offers us anything really new in terms of revealing meaning. No, "The descent" is so poor in terms of the quality of the image and sound, that it is detrimental to any important message that it could hope to convey - a message that, closely examined, does not constitute this innovation . <br /> I knew about the plot that was unfolding. What I wanted to see * was * the "descent" or degeneration of Dawson's character. As a big fan of Rosario, I was eager to see the layers removed and his psyche slowly twisted ... you know, the kind of representation that DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver". Unfortunately, the scenario and the director / writer's choices do not offer any kind of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest failure is the second act. The filmmaker's intentions regarding this segment of club-hopping, drug use and obsession of the great black stallion Adrian (the nightmare of each white boy, natch) from a DVD on the DVD have become obvious, but this excursion in the character of Dawson is never credible. made. We do not know exactly what she's doing half the time, what she's looking for or why she's doing it. The poor quality of the audio / video does not help yet, but the sequence is too long and unnecessary. It destroys all momentum and investment in the main character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well performed first act. By the time we reach the final, our interest has already faded. <br /> <br /> One of the successes cited by Dawson in the Q & A is that at the end of the "revenge" scene, we are pumped for punishment, then realize how much reality is long and ugly. While this is certainly valid, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. It's an excellent 8-minute breakout that is energetic and provocative (though all verbal) and really shows Dawson's slow agitation is materializing as she deliciously eats Francie Swift's little daughter, patronizing advisor. in dormitory. If more scenes like this had been added and more than an average third had been cut, we could have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> At the moment the film is preparing for the final cut However, all we get is what we saw before, but only in a more graphic rendering. So what?
