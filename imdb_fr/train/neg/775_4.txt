John Candy. Should we say more? It is the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how good he was as an actor. Witness his passing from poor slob to Jerk Horny. Just a simple change of face (subtle) and go. There are a lot of good pieces in this movie and a lot of really stupid pieces. The best moments for me are the scenes of KUNG FU U as well as the big moment when John (in a trance) comes on stage and tells how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I am sure that by reading this you might think that this sequence seems very crude. It's true, but it's also very funny especially because it's John Candy doing this job. The story in general is rather lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both former SCTV with Candy) do not have enough to do in the film. Levy has his highlights, including the wedding shoot at the end (think of Rod Serling) and the beautiful scene where he speaks on the phone with his mother. Overall, a good movie if you have had a difficult day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.
