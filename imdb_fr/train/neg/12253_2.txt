I never thought that a movie could be so atrocious, but alas I was wrong. Terrible effect, terrible plot, terrible effects. The Crocodile was awful and as far as the stupid sex / murder scene is concerned, it was a bad step from the beginning. It was really shocking and it is not a compliment! How can anyone do this movie, look back at it, and then say, "Yeah, it's a good movie, people are going to look at it." If you have not seen it, I beg you do not worry :-(
