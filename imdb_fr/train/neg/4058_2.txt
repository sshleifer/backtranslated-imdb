From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clich√©s that your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just because of the role of William Benton. I can not believe that people voted more than 6 years for this film. It is so biased towards a "certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born badly. They are not born good either. They are born with a blank slate. It is society, parents and education that make them what they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere in the end, it is certainly not the US penal system that puts them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than losing it with this shit. <br /> <br />
