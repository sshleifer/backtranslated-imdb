Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create an adaptation of the game that remains at least fairly faithful to the game; he turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a film full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's always Uwe Boll that we're dealing with here, so do not expect the film to be really good. "Postal" quickly loses its reception and becomes a real sorrow. <br /> <br /> Basically, Postal is a satire of the United States, like twelve years old. 1 year old child. Boll seems to think that the offensive is linearly proportional to the comic value: the most offensive, the funniest, and the most exaggerated, the funniest. The result is a film that sets new levels of disaffection while being extremely random. Yes, some gags work, but it seems to be pure chance. Highlights include the director who satirizes and people being hit very hard by trucks and other vehicles. Among the weak points, we find ... well almost everything else. <br /> <br /> Once the initial surprise has passed, Postal becomes just boring to watch. Yes, there's a good joke every ten minutes, but everything else is made up of hordes of boring characters shooting at each other and chasing each other for what seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> have worked as a short film, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (although the time is twice as long). There are good ideas and good tests, but they are desperately lost in endless and useless action scenes and in offensive content just for the pleasure of seeing it.
