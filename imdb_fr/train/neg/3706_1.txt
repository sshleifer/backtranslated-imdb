I told myself that the whole joke of the film would be to see a rich white man behave like Chris Rock, then see Chris Rock react to the reaction of people. Instead, you see that Chris Rock is himself and that people do not understand him. There may be 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their gimmick. It should have been much better.
