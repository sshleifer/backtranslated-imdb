The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as follows: "An experience on a severed arm went wrong," so right now, I thought it would be an arm that has its own spirit. , as shown by THE BEAST WITH CINQ FINGERS or THE HAND or someone who is undergoing an arm graft, as in BODY PARTS. Both rooms are tested and tested, or to be more precise, tired and tested, so I was curious to know how the producers would approach the story. I actually thought they were doing a fiction film like PI with the use of black and white photography at the beginning of the film, but the manufacturers seemed to get tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splashing comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. I have very little to say about it except that I did not like EVIL DEAD and SEVERED TIES, and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world claims condoms
