It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life, it's such a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low budget suites featuring D-Lister actors and a storyline similar to the first. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the Trash Bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 that silly I really thought it could be good. I watched disgustedly with stereotypes of actors torn apart from the screenplay and the screenplay of the first. <br /> <br /> Anyone who thought this -The video production was actually even a half-decent movie, you must be on crackd or something because I think that's what most people who have seen this movie think WHAT IS A FULL FACE !!!!
