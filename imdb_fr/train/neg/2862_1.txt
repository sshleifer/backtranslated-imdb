Someone has to send this guy from Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who told him he knew how to make a movie? Can anyone make movies these days? In the past, you always had to TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this film on BTK and the others he shot, it seems obvious that the poor guy has pretty much the same job as mine. In fact, I even think I could make better films than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S ALL. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other nonsense crap in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to get people's attention on his movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame he gained. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie that I would consider worse is this lame movie "DAHMER". This kid was smoking so much cigarettes that he was nauseating. Whoever did this needs to be shot.
