I still can not believe Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of shit. This film is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid, the acting is mediocre and the movie is deadly dull.I do not know why Craven hates his debut "Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes (probably) this turkey. Do not get me wrong, I really like some of his movies, but it was a real torture sitting and watching this.
