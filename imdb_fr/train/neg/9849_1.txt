It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad even at TV Movie standards. The plot is diabolically imperfect and the names known in this film are wasted in confused and uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep that excuse of a film together - it's so serious. Presented as a "psychological horror thriller" - it's certainly awful. There is nothing exciting about it. And that could do you some psychological damage! The first opening scenes were so promising: it was possible to determine if the soul was simply an aspect of the brain, but the total disaster that followed the scene of the car accident is unimaginable. Whatever your efforts, you do not care about the characters. There are so many ideas sprinkled that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases of Chinese philosophers, and at worst, the film would really make you lose your mind! Brain Dead! I bought more than 300 movies on DVD, and this is the first time I will get my money back. STEER CLEAR.
