A star for the "plot". A star for the acting game. A star for dubbing in the American voice. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity to undress. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before doing 'Manon sources'. Béart also undresses several times, but even his own outfit is enough to make this film eminently viewable. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend the three "first times" of a girl. It's cheesy, but still much more erotic than the rather choreographed "love scenes" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Incidentally, cinematography is not great; the still images for the closing credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
