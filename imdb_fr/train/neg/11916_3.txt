Yuck. I found it odd that their old book on curses was made with a common script font instead of being written by hand. The game is so apathetic at times and so dramatic at other times. Why would a "demonico" kill the two strangely silent doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for fun? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's bike every time she leaves somewhere? We understood! You spent a little money renting a third-class crotch rocket. It does not mean you have to show it all the time! The den of "Faith" looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school, with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where a few people are shown on a talk show for about 30 seconds before being killed for no apparent reason. Everyone is a disposable character. Forgotten characters and an even more memorable plot make this movie one of the most ill-conceived films I've ever seen in the SciFi channel. Stay away unless you are in bad movies.
