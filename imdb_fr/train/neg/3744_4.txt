This film attempts to present the theory of "Firearms, Sprouts and Steel" by Jared Diamonds, explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe. <br /> <br /> The version of this documentary is published over 2 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. Professor Jared Diamond observes birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond fails to properly use a bow and arrows, Professor Jared Diamond pulls a muzzle badly. Was this documentary supposed to make the hero "Professor Jared Diamond?" This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a travesty. The worst was when Diamond was crying and crying during a malaria service visit to an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Can Europeans use firearms, germs and steel to get them out of this catastrophic situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally gets to work, his theory is both interesting and totally boring. Europeans conquered indigenous peoples in other countries because they possessed rifles and thin blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a teacher to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how Europeans have come to have the advantages that allow conquest are interesting, but the cover is thin as paper. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as competent as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I already know it. If I'm racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me of his confusing use of native tools. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the target audience for this documentary. Children can enjoy this more than me, however. I read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
