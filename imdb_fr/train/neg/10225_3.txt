Now, I'll be the first to admit it when I say something that could be blasphemous or unfair, so I'd like to apologize in advance for my speech that says how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> summarize too. I did not like this movie. To be more precise, I did not like the concept of this film. The cinematography was good. The atmosphere was good. And the acting was satisfying. <br /> <br /> However, history is insane, inaccurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I'm a Cree Indian quarterback, and for some reason I feel insulted, personally, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And that's not a racist remark, I swear. The thought of a white, Hispanic or even Native American American swinging a katana on a roof offended all that the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbued with the soul of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. The fact that Ghost Dog uses his weapons instead of Katana is also an insult to the soul and the souls inside, and where on earth did he get a Katana anyway? It must be one of those lines, which insults even more the Samurai caste. <br /> <br /> In addition, Ghost Dog showed no honor. Towards the end of the film, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window, then murders a man by shooting him in the head through a drain cock. Not only is it a cowardly way to kill an enemy, it's more of a ninja way; silent assassins; a group that the samurai deny, exists but absolutely hates. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss, when he discovers that his boss is a bad guy. Do you know what a true Samurai does when he learns that his master is bad or dishonorable? He kills himself to prove that he would rather die before falling to the level of his doggish master. <br /> <br /> Everything in the character was a giant contradiction with the actual code to which all Samurai adhere: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So we have an excellent cinematography, a good atmosphere and an unscrupulous game including a plot and a principle of satiricule (which, unfortunately, is the most important aspect), which makes a film overall unsatisfactory. insulting all that a dear bushi (samurai) has at heart. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
