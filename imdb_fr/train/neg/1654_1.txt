Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers possible on stage (but who cares about hell) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true : zero. And I rarely give 1. Even for the most unhealthy films, I'm looking for elements such as music, cinematography, imagination, humor, even a good rhythm, to be as objective as possible at subject of the score. Looking at it in its own genres or subgenres. But there is absolutely nothing that redeems here. I do not remember another time when a film sent me to survey the room at the end. The only reason I came to the end was because I could not change channels - I sat there, bewildered, watching to see what insulting and stupid bit there was to come. It was like watching a snake digest a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and let's separate this baby, let's go. First of all, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. The visuals are all sitcom style. The cinematic scenes are just images of street traffic that spends the night again and again. The music and the score do not only contribute to the film, they are odious. Not to mention the fact that he has nothing to contribute anyway. The game of actors is like cardboard, all around, and this is also true for Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who gave the green light to this train wreck). These guys, supposed to be good friends, have no more chemistry or reason to be than if director Peter M. Cohen had found them at a bus station a few minutes before the shoot. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is not an original bone in his body. There is no imagination. This shows nothing we have seen a thousand times before. The premise or "turn" of this film is based on the denigration of men and "the idea" that a woman with power can play the role of a man "as we do." Anyone who thinks that this is one way or another of an original, has obviously never turned on a television before. Twisted, shallow women are common. The denigration of men is the norm. It's not stealing anything in particular, it's worse: it's stealing clichés. I can not imagine a woman making a film that portrays other women who are so based on stereotypes and that sense of contempt. Give me the desire to go rent "In the company of men" - or even better, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be a more "cutting-edge" version of "There's something about Mary", so bad that you can see sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no idea of ​​women, men, dating, sex, or anything. Cohen is content to regurgitate the myths with which he has been indoctrinated into other sexist films. On the other hand, the film does not work either as a satire, because even if it is full of exaggerations, it could be described as "satirical", but it does not have the rooting of which it really need. He does not even know what he's doing satire. Then there is the dialogue, which is a little more than the characters who scream obscenities. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all other discretion: There are many movies without plot, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscene dialogues that have been fun and so good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not a second. He has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all completely wrong, without any basis of truth, but enough to make us laugh. The characters are all widely drawn, so that they will appear as corresponding to the lowest common denominator. Just look at "the marquee scene", the scene of the "classic classical" hair gel. One of our feeble anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees the vibrator of Mena (Peet). For some reason, the light shines on it as if it had found the Holy Grail. Why Cohen thinks that men react to vibrators that I do not know. As he rubs his hands, he drops them in the toilet and then tries to fish them with his bare hands when, oh there, Mena supports him. Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But curiously, people like this movie. Of course, people also like "Friends" and reality shows, so I should not be surprised. All this, however, has a common denominator. "Whipped" is for me a great proof that there is in America a considerable number of people who will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. They will love any show or movie (or think they will like it) simply because they are dating or romantic relationships. His lack of quality did not expose these people. Just as people are encouraged to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, whiter teeth, and thinner bodies, they are also indoctrinated to blindly dump everything related to their relationship to sell them to people. televisions, films and other cheap and empty products. <br /> <br /> The only consolation will be that when I die, because I have seen this film, I have the merit of recovering 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
