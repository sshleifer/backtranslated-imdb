"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved movies of all time. ACS has managed to bring the viewer to a time and place such that very few movies have ever seen it. He had a sweetness and a good will that were rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for his sequel, "It Runs In The Family". The film was almost released several times, only to be shot at the last minute. When it was released, IRITF was (and is, I suppose) a total failure. <br /> <br /> The sets and the cinematography were perfect, but the staging completely missed the goal. The film was nothing more than an economic formula: lazy casting, lazy writing and off-line role playing. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the greatest comedians and storytellers in the United States, is a false reflection of the warm spirit he used in ACS. He was too emotional and why he did that, I'll never know. He has managed to become a boring and overworked parody of himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and playing at IRITF are unauthentic and forced. The actors may have seen ACS, but the ideas and nuances present in ACS must absolutely not have been recorded. The acting was embarrassing and devoid of Shepard's dry mood. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF as a sequel is tantamount to insulting all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
