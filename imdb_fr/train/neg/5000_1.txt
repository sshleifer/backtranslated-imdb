This is probably the worst excuse for TV programming since, oh, I do not know, WHAT HAPPENS? Nothing has ever happened on this ridiculous "series". Although it's mainly Britney and Kevin who shot, you do not get good details in your personal life. It's mostly stupid and stupid chatter and acting like white garbage. Look, I love Britney's music as much as the girl to come, but this series is pure fulfillment for a nation so addicted to Britney that she would watch her toenail (yes, it could be a real episode ). Thank God, these two separated, because they were painful together. This show is TOXIC!
