A very bad attempt at a young spinal tap. At least the music in Spinal Tap was good. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at worst. A group of Hollywood experts, bad musicians and producers have created a show of "poo" so that their children can be in the spotlight. Oh please! The jar of humor was even bad. I hate this stuff when there really are incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors, and artists) who pop their asses for success and that shit happens. <br /> <br /> Help all of you !!!! Why was Gene Simmons not there ??? America's taste for entertainment goes into the bathroom.
