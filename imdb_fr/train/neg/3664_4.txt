Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a Yeti, which makes him become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after attacking his unfaithful wife and lover, and is then resuscitated by a scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses it in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovered an underground asylum populated with strange subjects from the doctor's failed experiences. <br /> <br /> After hearing about the death of Naschy by his colleague Jon Kitley, I searched my collection to find a suitable film. In my race, I discovered that I did not have one but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The film is dubious video quality, the sound is dubbed poorly, the cinematography is somehow a burlesque style. And American versions have two deleted love scenes. Frankly, without a copy not remastered and uncut, I did not really have the good movie in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series on Werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I guess that's true, but you would not know it in the movie itself. The plot is sometimes confusing, and nothing indicates that it is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Maybe the flaws of the film can be forgiven if to understand the hell of the production he has gone through. Although floating for years, it was only published in 1973 due to problems with finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic and he hated working with him. These are not really light accusations, and I do not know what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. <br /> <br /> It is likely that sooner or later you will encounter a mediocre version of "Fury". "It appears in a variety of packs of three and boxes, so you could accidentally acquire it without even knowing it.What really needs to happen is an uncut US version, with a good mix of sound and video, and the love scenes returned.As far as I know, this does not exist.We pay homage to the legacy of Paul Naschy and present his films to a wider audience with the quality level that 'he deserves.
