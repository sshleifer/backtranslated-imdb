I'm not one of those who log in after watching a movie and decided to call it the worst movie of all time. If you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. However, for the first time in my life, I saw a film so horrible that I wanted to write how bad it was before it was over. <br /> <br /> I LOVE bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and most horror horror movies were good. However, there is not one good thing I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is fundamentally non-existent. If someone who reads my opinion wastes his money to see it, he can get an idea of ​​what might be the plot, but I advise you to earn a dime more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two main roles are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not one to spoil a movie for anyone, but I invite anyone to send me an email at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask me my opinion about this movie before they lose a dime on it. I will tell you everything. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies, horror movies and new inventive movies. I even love the pornographic horror stuff like the hostel (some commentators have claimed it was like, but obviously they only thought about the cause of Roger Bart who was in this hostel and hostel 2 ). But it may be the most worthless and stupid and stupid film ever made. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this criticism, it comes from someone who has not only attended the TOTALITY of House of the Dead. but actually bought a copy.
