I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time, I complied. Night Listener is without a doubt one of the saddest films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this movie anyway - I did not care about any of the characters, I did not buy the mystery plot, no matter how it was is finished .... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing. Highlights include (no spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a barking dog in front of a hotel room, a car passing over rough terrain and a truck that sounds like a trumpet. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and was hoping for a strange role similar to Williams', but unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. What's even more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just did not fit work for me. <br /> <br /> I might have even given 1/10 but this score is reserved for the remake of The Producers
