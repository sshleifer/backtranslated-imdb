It may not be the worst film Peter Sellers has ever done (I think this laurel is awarded to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it is surely the most depressing. The sellers, especially without makeup like Nayland Smith, seem to have undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, he looks barely better and spends most of the film (except for those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets shaken by electric currents) to the point of collapsing under the weight of all this makeup. Supportive players also look tired and exhausted, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A positive point: it would be one of the last times that a major film would represent Asians so insulting ... or, indeed, would feature a non-Asian as such!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, with dubious shots and bland decors - even the impressive number of Elvis at the end seems less good. Only the astonishing Helen Mirren and the tall, slender guy who wets her pants add a spark of life to this sad affair. In total, this film offers a strange premonition of the death of a great comic and an even more disturbing documentation of his death.
