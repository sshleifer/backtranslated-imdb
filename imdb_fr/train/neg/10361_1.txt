This failure of the ABC television channel absolutely does not do justice to the brilliant fantasy novel A Wrinkle in Time. Madeleine L'Engle has brought children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world, one of a kind. This novel, the first of his "quartet", is a beautiful interpretation of life, the universe and time itself. Yet it is easy for any child or teenager to understand. His unshakeable morality is spread throughout the book. This film adaptation can be considered as a simple mockery of the work of art of Mrs. L'Engle. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is complex and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and all the magical features of the novel have been lost. It was a horrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day, an intelligent and dignified director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates and Alfonso Cuarón) will try once again to put this book on screen and understand it for what it really is: a leader -d'œuvre. This adaptation can only be compared to a boring, dummy and cheap motel room art that does not hold and has no impact on its audience.
