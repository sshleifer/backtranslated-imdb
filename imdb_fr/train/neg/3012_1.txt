The film opens with a long photo of factory walkways filled with workers. My, what we did to the planet, you might think. I hope we will see other things like this. <br /> <br /> It's very rare. When you do not look at a horribly filmed narrator angle in a conference room, you watch him set his camera to take pictures at different places. It would be nice to choose areas that fit better with it, but it does not. Then you will hear a little more narration, observe some pictures and watch him install his camera. Why not use the filming camera to show more landscapes instead? This really kills all sense of rhythm and portrays the guy as a vain idiot. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how a person installs their camera, fast forward in this movie and loses much less time.
