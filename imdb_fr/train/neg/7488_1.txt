Anyone who has seen the original 1970 film knows how an excellent cast, screenplay and director can create a comedy masterpiece. In the same way, it's easy to see how the opposite can create another tasteless Hollywood! This film was pathetic! Without John Cleese (a comic book genius), I'd be out about 15 minutes into this terrible mess of celluloid. Neil Simon would not write another script for this version (he said he could not get better first), and I'm surprised that after this movie fiasco, he will not sue for defamation of 'humor! the original, what were the producers thinking of when they launched this one? How did the director and the publisher look at these scenes and think that some of them were funny? I do not know, but I know one thing: it is not surprising that foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
