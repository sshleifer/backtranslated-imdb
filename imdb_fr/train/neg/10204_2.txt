At first, the film seemed to go very well, the character profiles were defined ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... However, as the film progressed, it seemed that the director was focusing on the bad kind of things. ..or just a lot was edited from the movie. The identities of the characters changed for the worse in the movie. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implied meaning - in other words - there were things in the movie that did not seem to fit the movie itself. AND the title ... in the movie, the title does not match the movie ... I guess the title works for the previews ... The actors played well with what they had ... if they had a better director and writer, maybe it would have worked better. But that was not the case. So now, there's a new awful movie coming out this Friday ... My opinion! ... do not waste your time and money.
