First of all, the character of the title is not even the main character of the film. He is the companion of the leader of the sect. The actor who portrays Igor believed that shouting, laughing hysterically and smirking while stealing your eyes would be a great way to scare people. Igor was also used to screaming (because he had never really spoken) in a shrill voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when the leader of the sect murders one of his followers with a buzz, Igor, seeing this, shouts, "Paul, no, Paul, why did you do it, I could have cleaned it, so clean!" In another scene, Igor tells a victim that she should "have her own tools operated, because right now it's time to act." Apart from the bad acting, the end did not make sense because, even if history accumulates the little steam it has to reach its peak, Igor receives a crossbow arrow and the rest his crazy companions die, he shows up twice more to kill the remaining "good guys". The film provides no explanation for this, it simply tells the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? In the end, do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could recover the lost moments by watching this.
