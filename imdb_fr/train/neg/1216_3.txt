The genre of the suspense movie really plunges into this one. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that would provoke suspense and the feeling of tension that would ensue, but this movie was so predictable and just not credible. I find that the more I watch this kind of film, the more I constantly say things to the actors to remove them from danger. Constantly making bad decisions only rubs against stupidity. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have liked it a little bit. That said, you'd better stay away from this one.
