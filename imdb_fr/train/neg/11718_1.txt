It's incredible!! ..yes, someone before me wrote that it was a wasted time to sit down and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do it! I am totally upset! I liked Wesley Snipes and I found it funny that he plays the name of his name in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (at home only of course) but now (right after) I am absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie of all time. Inwatchable !! Bad actor! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! ..A single good think: this wonderful girl! Must be a model surely! Eeeeh !! MB .. 10 lines minimum ?! I do not want to waste your time reading my opinion! I hope I have been clear and sub-stable, because English is not my mother tongue method. So, take the time to watch and watch good movies, like the ones I'm trying too. Peace!
