I love the MBBS munna bhai but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such a boring movie in my life. And these high ratings really surprised me that what happened to the taste of Indian viewers ?? <br /> <br /> ** CAN BE A SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs the advice of a Bhai, a person discussing her personal problem. on the phones come on the man of what part of the world are you ??? I agree that films must be fictitious, but that these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10. (2 stars for the first 15 minutes that start)
