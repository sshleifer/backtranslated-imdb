** Spoilers Possible ** <br /> <br /> Jason (grass) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the dullest car accident of all time. Leith is beheaded and the doctor brings his small cut hazelnut home and rejuvenates the head of his laboratory. The exterior of the manor was filmed in the Lyndhurst estate of Tarrytown; the laboratory scenes were apparently shot in someone's basement. The bandaged head is kept alive on fairly inexpensive "laboratory equipment" for Ed Wood. Part of the library's music - the highlight of the film - was later found in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has heavy metaphysical rhetoric with another duped Ever, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doctor roams the joints in search of a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle. The end, in uncut copies, features splashes and dismemberments ahead of time when the zucchini monster comes out of the closet to close the film. It took three years for this thing to be released, and then the public received the bad welcome it deserved. Between that, PLAN 9 OUTDOORS and some others, one should have declared 1959 The Year of Turkey.
