Hey, not a good movie. So fair, effects, a decent soundtrack but familiar and uninventive. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths that follow one another at the beginning of the film, which makes it a pretty good scene in which everything seems to be allowed. Apart from that, many characters wander without knowing what is happening or chasing red herrings; more killings of time than people. There are other deaths, and the murderer is a murderer on an equal footing, and is not part of a tool. The killer also likes to incite others to kill innocent people. The identity is not revealed at the end, and the pattern is rather thin, and we do not care about it. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the film takes place around Christmas, but it's not a major factor. A scene is lit by Christmas lights, that's about it. <br /> <br /> The film is rather dark, with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the video tape that I watched. Part of the dialogue was lost in some of the opening scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We think we realize what happened, although there is a chance that something else has done it.
