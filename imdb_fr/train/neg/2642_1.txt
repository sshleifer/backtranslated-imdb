Slow, slow, slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you do not know who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. The secret services must have been too, because it took all the film to mount it. There are no convincing characters in the movie (no movie). The rhythm of the film is slow, there is no tension. The committed killer is a great shot unless he targets Michael Douglas as all he can seem to hit is big windows. The funniest scene of the film takes place when the president's wife pronounced the code word in the anti-climatic end. It's ridiculously ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I was not sitting in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
