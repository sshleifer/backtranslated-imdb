It must be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever! And that says a lot because the line of stinks is long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now, at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was saved from Gilligan Island! Tina Louise, who looks frightened (she was probably afraid of someone seeing this mess!) Is a distressed motorist tormented by the most disgusting biker gang in the history of cinema. But, do not worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West, a hickie city doctor, comes to the rescue! Pow! To crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only assets of this "bomb" are cute women, laughable battle scenes and the always "sexy" Tina Louise!
