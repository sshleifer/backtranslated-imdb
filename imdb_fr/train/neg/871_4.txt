Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local village of Reverand, married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a usual womanizer and decides to feign her own death to flee with her current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, in doing so, he has a crisis of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also present as a crazy old fool who plays for the good Reverand in the tones of "Misery". It's sad to see a very good casting wasted like that. Not in the least John Savage in a horribly forgettable role as a private investigator of poor quality. In a film presented as a "black comedy", it is necessary to integrate BOTH elements in said film. Although this is the first to shovel, it unfortunately does not contain any of the latest. In addition, you can not focus on any of the characters, so you have absolutely no interest in acquiring them. Technically, it's not a bad film as a whole, but an extremely forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My note: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw her: Showtime Showcase
