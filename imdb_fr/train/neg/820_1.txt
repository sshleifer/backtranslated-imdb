What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and in Kennedy's very confusing scenario? Were there any pieces left on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confused story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role? <br /> <br /> The principle of Domino wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark by far. A major miss by Stanley Kramer.
