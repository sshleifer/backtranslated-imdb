I just sent an e-mail to a friend who is at film school about this movie. Something to avoid when you make a movie: characters chatting on the screen on foolish, overworked and complicated monologues, which are finally banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal checkpoints are so excessive that they draw attention to the movie as a film and actually neutralize that intention. Is the acting, or the scenario that is bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also very incredible for social realism - voraciously consuming English canonical literature and the Bible as long as it is high or hangover and capable of producing it profoundly sophomoric soliloquies in state of being. inebriation? And how can such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally harmful character be able to sleep most of the women he meets a few minutes after meeting them? (I had to cheer when a chick finally threw him into the street, despite his plaintive and self-pitying jokes.) <br /> <br /> The viewer meets pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. . The imminent destiny of humanity, in the form of barcodes printed on our foreheads or our frighteningly biblical straight hands, is presented to a character who is so adeptly exposed in his role as guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is over-scripted and excessive - a clumsily awkward melodrama of pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, of life, etc. It is commonplace, overloaded and tedious. <br /> <br /> There are very good English movies available with content similar to this movie. "Nile by Mouth" is an excellent and much more interesting excursion into the lives of people living in a similar social environment. Same for "In the Warzone". And although the comparison is not even justified, do not miss out on Peter Greenaway, who manages much more skilfully dialogues, characters and absurd situations.
