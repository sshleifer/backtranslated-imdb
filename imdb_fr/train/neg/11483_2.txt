I was completely excited to watch this movie. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleaned here in New Zealand. I should not have built so much because it was so disappointing and it is without a doubt Clark's worst film. There are so many problems with this movie. First, some actors are great, especially Nick Stahl in "The Bully" and the girl with brown curly hair (I can not remember her name), but most were so little in touch with the world and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in "Kids", but in "Bully", he invests his lines with such solemnity that he virtually transforms his scenes into a parody. The script seemed to have been written by a first-year film student. No, sorry, a high school student ... who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Did he try to emphasize the lack of meaning of the existence of these children? In any case, that did not stop him from getting into a fucking good pervert. I'm not prude but I did not need to see the breasts and teenage ass every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I do not think he'll ever succeed.
