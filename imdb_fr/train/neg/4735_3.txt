It can not be denied that the first Azumi movie was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of a popular manga, composed of attractive young actors and not missing from the budget department. Still, he is more than entertained for what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" lacks everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should sound the alarm is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his visual flair and his kinetics, but also the original style, the beauty and especially his heart. While the former had a simple "hitlist" plot, this one has a whole lot of story to tell, with too many dark characters stabbing in the back, so many times that any potential for sympathy or pathos is canceled. No more effective interaction between the main characters; Azumi and his cohorts are often reduced to a gang of raging teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterization is non-existent; If anyone looks who actually lives and who dies, I will be in shock. The same thing applies to the bad guys here. The final battle - in fact all battles - is completely devoid of any tension. The fact that they are poorly choreographed and misdirected - not to mention a few - has become a sideline for their sheer uselessness. The bad guys themselves are too much of a camper striker and, even if they are all combined, they do not enter a country worthy of Jo Odagiri's Pete Burnsian antics in the original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto is doing her best, it must be said, and she has also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a full-fledged assassin, which means she can agitate her sword in slow motion; Unfortunately, now, the character is inculcated with a sort of mysterious Man With No Name style, the Ueto model becomes even more inappropriate. I know this is supposed to be the goal, but that, combined with the inefficiency of all the other actors in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptitude of the film in general, means that it is downright impossible to hide behind his character. The less we say about Chiaki "Remember Kill Bill", Kuriyama's performance will be better; Suffice it to say that his "bend" of good and bad is about as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a colossal disappointment. All the merits were made ten times better in the first film. A lazy, unsatisfying disorder - and generally downright boring.
