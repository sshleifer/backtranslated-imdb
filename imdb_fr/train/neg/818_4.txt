This film is remarkable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two series of "Superman", this low-budget feature film was produced and broadcast in theaters, marking "George Reeves and Phyllis Coates' first appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well enters the "Hollow Earth", allowing the "Moles-Men" to rise to the surface. Forget the other holes (those of the plot). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike most of the 50's SF invasion movies, the hero plays a dominant (and determining) role in preaching, tolerance, and acceptance of difference. against a raging crowd of segregationist vigilantes. No 'moderate reporter' here! Clark Kent, competent and self-confident, takes control of the situation from end to end ("I'll take care of it!"), Even helping a hospital gown to remove a bullet from a mole-man ! As a Superman, he is sweeter than Clark with the fiery Lois, but he is also the spokesperson for reason and tolerance as he fights against the defense groups by calling them of "soldiers of the Nazi storm". <br /> <br /> Third, you'll notice that the transition from Superman's animated flight into the two Fleisher-like cartoon series is not over yet.
