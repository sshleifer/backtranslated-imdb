It was one of the most dismal movies we've seen in recent months with a predictable plot and rather bad acting (mostly supporting characters). Hugh Laurie's interview on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously worked a lot to learn how to dance samba, but the scope of his character It was only necessary for him to dive at the end of the children's pool. The film is based on the appearance of a pretty girl and good music but that is not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rio, nor the inside of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10
