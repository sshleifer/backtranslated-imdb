I enjoyed the atmosphere of the first minutes, but after 20 minutes, I pressed generously on the button fast forward. Far too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, in the corridors, through the doors and into the street, and as many shots of him seeming thoughtful and confused. This gave me the impression that the story was originally conceived as a short film (20-30 minutes), then that it had become a feature film as a work of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay). > <br /> It might have been more fun if one of the characters had something to say that I had never heard in many other movies before, or if the end was not - unfortunately - the one I had predicted for three minutes in the film (atypical for an independent film / studio smaller). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not your absurdity of Hollywood manipulation according to the usual formula.
