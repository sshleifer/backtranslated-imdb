This film is not only bad, not just cheesy, it's disgusting. Something about Daphne, about the scary call-girl, about all that damn movie (and I use the word to the letter) makes a grotesque that offends a mistress of brothel. This film hurts my skin, makes me regret having reproductive organs and makes me feel impure. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me the most about this film is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the clich√© Worst Nightmare and the exaggerated Twisted Wish, is a really fascinating movie idea. <br /> <br /> Thought: The reason why hobgoblins must be killed before the day is that they are attracted by bright lights. Count Hobgoblins: four Hobobblins leave the movie studio and release at least nine of the most pernicious teddy. the toys are killed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Question for Debate: If you had an icy, demanding and ungrateful girlfriend, would you like to enter the garden-tool-fight with a military chunkhead? Explain.
