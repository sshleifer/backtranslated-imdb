A poorly written script without nice characters. As for comedy, I forgot to laugh. These are two vain friends who are trying to put too much women in bed (no sex scenes) and another friend (who is weird, almost disconcerting) who sometimes also scammers but who is mainly considered the type who masters . The 3 friends meet and fall separately for the same woman (Amanda Peet). In a way, this is done without much romance. The 3 guys stop being friends because they date it separately. She chased them out of their friendship because they scammed women. - a bad movie
