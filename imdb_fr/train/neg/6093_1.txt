It must be the worst movie I have ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work. The DVD worked well. The movie did not work. In fact, it's so serious that I do not think the actors have worked since (or before judging by the acting). There is no true conspiracy or real horror. Production values ​​are bland, even for a low-budget movie, with some outdoor scenes being difficult to hear because of the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was such a bad film that the viewer could believe it. to turn into a porn if they did not know better (which was an improvement). In the movie, there are only two fun replicas, both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch every 76 minutes for) <br /> <br /> When it comes to marketing the DVD, I feel completely deceived. I mean by reading back, I was expecting it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He selected his victims. He took his nose. He turned into a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. Moreover, the case claims that it is numerically controlled; I would like to have seen it beforehand, the printing is so grainy that you can use it as sand paper. The case also indicates that this is an absolutely disgusting film, IN WHAT WAY ?, a disgusting and acting production. <br /> <br /> This movie is welcome in the first five minutes (if you plan to say 'buy bad taste' instead it's a much better movie and is funny, it also has Peter Jackson the director LOTR in.) <br /> <br /> Incidentally, if anyone knows anything about one of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they've done since, thank you for posting here as I would like to know, only to know if there is a worse movie, or if anyone in this movie has ever bothered to learn to play
