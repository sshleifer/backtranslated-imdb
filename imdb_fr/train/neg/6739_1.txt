One may wonder why anyone would try to reshape the intrigues of successful movies that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not even try to redo, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been left behind. If a project like this one is approved by the big studios, then put forward by the big stars and the brilliant values ​​of the production, the people will come to look for them. <br /> <br /> Alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be related to the way writers have transplanted history to London, when in reality it was a typical situation in the United States that even the environment can not solve. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict since the beginning, the viewer is not drawn into the film as the creators thought. It is clear that Kat will fall in love with Nick, and conversely, in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best thing about "Junebug", appears as a shallow girl who is willing to continue to lie and not to deny the man who loves her and who will marry her. <br /> <For those interested, the credits at the end of the film lasts almost seven minutes!
