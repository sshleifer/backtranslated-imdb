- I planned to write something to explain what I did not like in this movie, but it will be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I do not remember much. I watched it just three days ago and it did not make much of an impression. This is usually a sign of a real stink. The only thing I remember was being incredibly bored. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-alike while the detective fainted very quickly. It would be different if he could play, but he is an artist of a note. Killing scenes were handled in an amateur manner and no suspense preceded them. If you can not spot the murderer five minutes after the beginning of the movie, you must see more horror for the euro. The casting is a deadly sign of the killer's identity.
