Not to be confused with Madonna's movie "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly comedy, camper and quirky that tells the story of a man who aspires to launch a magazine reviews a variety emerging artists. This low-budget, independent film makes "Chuck and Buck" a masterpiece. Full of unhealthy actors, mediocre sets, costumed, etc., "... Thing" deserved very bad reviews and, to date, it has been nominated only for a marginal price. Pass on this one.
