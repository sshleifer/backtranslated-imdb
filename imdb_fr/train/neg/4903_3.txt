I'm never a big fan of Taiwan film production, unlike Korea, Hong Kong or even China. The strong game quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this movie. I do not consider myself an audience as difficult to satisfy as I am, in fact, a fan of independent films. However, this film shows the weak plot and the slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to the direction of the plot. The acting game certainly does not make it better. Rainie's game is mediocre in that she "over-act", trying to be pretty and cute. Although I have to admit that she is a pleasure to watch. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, regretful and extremely reserved character. Overall, I find this film a disappointment.
