I tried to watch this movie without really being able to sit on it, because it is supposed to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to a particular interpretation of the Scriptures. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. Plus, I'm a movie maniac and playing in this movie was completely unacceptable. Never before have I wanted a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you want to be preached unceasingly by those without authority, then get this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who love or love scifi, because the title will also deceive many people. It was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and these possibilities were ruined. The only redeemable quality of the film is that it made me understand that the character of "Time Machine" would probably have had to show a little more moral indignation at the strange behavior of those who would follow him.
