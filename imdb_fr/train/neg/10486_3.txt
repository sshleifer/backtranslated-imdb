My main comment about this film is how did Zwick get credible actors to work on this film? Impressive casting ?? even for the support characters, which does not really help this movie. I have to admit that Tom Hank's cameo was almost worth it ?? what was Tom? Have you lost a bet? Joe Isuzu is the best cameo of the movie - by far a classic! The premise is good. The character of Basinger, struggling with a pink lady's existence, heads to a Vegas motel by creating the glorious pyramid of cosmetics sales. This happens as the character of Corbett is about to travel to Vegas to deliver an Elvis costume to his future wife, motivated by extortion. While they are both heading, they have many meetings with Elvis imitators who are heading to a convention imitating Elvis in Vegas. Soon, the FBI intervenes and starts following what he thinks is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie was good. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, imagine that you are back in first grade ?? when scenarios and continuity are not really important. It's a lot more fun to just watch Basinger in her Pink Lady costume, rather than wonder why what she does does not really make sense. The film does its best, but ends up falling. In the end, it is full of theoretically funny ideas, but in practice they were not so amusing. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst, but you may want to leave the building watching this movie. a???? Do not say that I did not warn you!
