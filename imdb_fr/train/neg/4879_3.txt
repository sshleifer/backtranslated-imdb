Is there nothing worse than a comedy film without humor? The answer is yes; the one that arouses no interest in the image. The premise is not so bad - a naive man for an illegal business - but it's a cauldron with a poor scenario and scenario and it just does not work. <br /> <br /> Was this considered a good 'B' 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the photo is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30s and' 40s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I still reject Richard Cromwell as the faint who killed Gary Cooper). in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer", so I did not count it). <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it and give it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal.
