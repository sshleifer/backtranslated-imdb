Killer Tongue is one of the worst movies I've ever seen displeasing, Killer Tongue is a horrible mix of the worst elements of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Brain Damage and Pulp Fiction. Designed primarily to offend, apparently, but so much, that only the most shameful conservatives would be caught in it.
