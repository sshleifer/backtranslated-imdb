Now, I recently had the pleasure of watching the hilarious Bachelor Party comedy, one of my favorite new comedies, which started to laugh until it hurt the type of movie. So naturally, I wanted to see more, hoping she would have the same bursts of laughter, but instead, Bachelor Party 2: The last temptation is made by the American generation Pie where he has no taste and undoes the purpose of the first film. Yes, the first movie contains nudity, but it does not show in all scenes. Also the plot is exactly the same from the beginning, it's not always a complaint with me, but it could have been a little more original. The only thing is that I'm happy that at least no former actor of the original appears in this film because it would have been ridiculous or really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only 2 months of meetings, everyone is against. Melinda has a rich family, but they are quite happy with Ron and his brother, Todd, is afraid Ron will take his job. So they go on a weekend in Miami for a bachelor party and Todd will make sure he traps Ron in a photo that will change his mind about Melinda's wedding. Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation makes a few people laugh here and there, but fails to deliver what the first movie has done These guys, Ron's friends, were more obnoxious than Nice, except for Seth, he was pretty funny. The only friendly characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, all the others annoy you more or less. Do you want to watch this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing, but we do not pretend it's a movie. Stand in at the original Bachelor Party, it's the movie that will make you cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
