Years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) came across the plot that implied the replacement of humans by machines. Since then, a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we have lost, now a super-woman who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (she also inherits only half of her minimal actress capacity ), which is, I think, the minimal link between the film and the first. However, when the super-woman is created, she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter of the future chases this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis has become a cult hit, I understand why people liked it even though I was not a fan of this movie. Nemesis has tried very ambitiously to propose different ideas, to develop a beautiful look and provide a ton of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have this ambition, it's a cheap swindle of The Terminator with a muscular woman who has so little act that she hurts the act she gives to Olivier Gruner. The air of a Thespian master and the action sequences lack the explosive range that was the main point of sale of the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but it deserved better follow-up than that one. The original also featured good actors such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes, Jackie Earle Haley, this one featuring no one. This time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe. In fact, after seeing this, I had the idea to add a half-star to the original. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
