I finally had the opportunity to take a look at this experimental Lynch after waiting so long ... and unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for a hardcore fan of Lynch, I found it very tedious .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful breaks where nothing happens, of monotonous long speeches where nothing happens, and ends with the spectator not knowing or caring what it was, what had happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> There was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita - and a Lost Highway moment with hints of an important event that happened but of which we can not speak clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget that I've ever watched it. Sorry David!
