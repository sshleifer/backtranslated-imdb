You get a gift. He is extraordinarily enveloped. The box in which it is located is handmade from the finest wood and shows the skill down to the smallest detail. It is then wrapped in beautiful paper, hand-made and hand-painted by the most talented artists. The whole is wrapped in ribbons in fine silk lace. It's a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, tear the paper, open the box and you can not find anything. It's toys. Either you like the packaging, or you forget it. <br /> <br /> The film is not without interest: the war is not a good thing. Well, is not it original? Morality is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to point it out. And even this faint idea is undermined by a story in which elements of the war - especially war toys - are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It's like someone preaching a sermon that is stern and condescending, ending with saying, "I'm kidding." <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the film does not go to the magnifying glass. Yes, it's a sight to behold with remarkable and striking images. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography skilfully captures the colorful scenes. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. As in the scenario, the film is devoid of joy and sometimes aesthetically sterile and surreal. It is a film that wants to make toys wonderful and special things, while showing them as creations of an empty and cold world. The film strives to be funny, morose, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, the besieged heir to an empire of toy makers, throws in his shitick ad-lib, which seems to be alien to the weird and coldly structured world he inhabits. Indeed, current references and insipid sexual insinuations scattered are in blatant contradiction with the childish fable that the film vaguely seeks to be. For this film to work or make sense, it must be placed in its own universe, an Oz very far from Kansas. Whenever the jokes bring us back to reality, the movie's playground becomes more and more an obvious sham. <br /> <br /> It is said that this was the animal project of director Barry Levinson, which he strove to create. for ten years. Unfortunately, it's hard to see why he's struggled to get back. Like most of the pet projects that were finally made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are excellent examples), it seems like a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. Maybe Levinson has directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he does not have a new vision of this when he has finally arrived on the scene. He had already perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Most of the toys presented in the film are awkward, mechanical monsters and to go up. So the film itself.
