I can not believe that this shot filmed and realized in a wooded way was realized. There are about four beautiful photos (the director should think about moving to photography) and that's it. A strong cast is totally lost, the scenes end repeatedly at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new. Please spare this movie.
