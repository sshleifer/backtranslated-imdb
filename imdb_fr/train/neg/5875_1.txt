This film is about two former football players, Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work in private and meet all kinds of women and men with difficult backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who is working on having sex on the phone. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for help with several other women. Mack and Lenny have more free time and often go to Miami Florida. Golf courses or spending time in a sports bar where all sorts of activities take place in the city. There are a lot of punches, murders and a lot of two-way words that bring this movie back to a big ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie only cost me 50 cents and it was too much.
