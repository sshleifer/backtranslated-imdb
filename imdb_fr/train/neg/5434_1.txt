Sensational. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few complaints. - The screenwriter has eliminated two main characters from the book. - The parcel has been changed in a grotesque way. - The voice-over sounds as if they come directly from written passages (which can be well read but are not identical when they are spoken, especially with the writing style of Chabon). - The acting game is more wood than a log cabin. (Esp Bechstein) - This is supposed to be settled in 1983 ??? It feels more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it is possible that he has redeemed himself .. I really hope that no one has paid to see this, or at least anyone who has read the book hoping for something suitable (at the Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer but he should be ASHAMED for this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
