I rented this movie yesterday and I can hardly express my disappointment with the little Laura Ingalls for being involved in something so badly produced. I'm not sure if this is a horrible writing or a bad staging or both, but it leaves a spectator very disappointed to have lost the time to watch this video. It was a naive and weak story, very poor lines and rested only on beautiful landscapes and pretty people. Unfortunately, that was not enough. You'd better rent a cassette full of static electricity than waste your time on that shit. Lindsey Wagner has also played a rather pathetic role as a rancher who apparently works very hard without doing anything. Anyone who's ever been to a ranch knows it was written by a Los Angeles boy, not a connoisseur of the world. .
