Recovery: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a horror movie from the Christian Coalition. Ok, maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque, Lauren Currie Lewis) is hunted down and probably killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, rather threatening and brutal). I say maybe because she wakes up and everything was a dream? .. Where was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem of the film is that these fifteen minutes of intrigue (pretty well done the first time) are repeated again and again. And as Claire wakes up each time and each scene is clearly a dream or alternative reality, I did not think about anything that had happened to Claire and began to wonder what a nauseating turn in the end was going to make it possible. <br /> <br /> I was looking for a session (which, honestly, would have been more logical), but one of these became too obvious by half surprise ending (Think about the village or below) . The film collapses faster than the directors of Donnie Darko. All the big turns of horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original invasion of Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience did not expect an explanation of the left field. (Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday 13 was worth being shaken) <br /> <br /> On the other side, the recovery screams of the twists that end with each change of scene. The soundtrack of a note (although the songs presented are decent), the time that passes (Claire doing the dishes, the secondary intrigues of the mother of Claire), are other recurring defects, as Claire says "hello is someone "whenever she thinks there is a killer serial about it. <br /> <br /> Some of the secondary side roles (especially Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander that looks like a Mary Kay zombie) show the first time an actor has low-budget roots. <br /> <br /> Both are too smart and not smart enough. Salvage keeps your interest, if only to see how they will repair this mess. The problem is that they do not really do it.
