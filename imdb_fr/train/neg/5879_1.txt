I wonder how the actors acted in this film. Was Annette Bening really herself, half in and half out, pretending or natural? It made no difference since even if she had walked on the ceiling, it would not have changed the pattern of the movie. Brian Cox did very well. I almost thought he had always acted that way, cunning, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one really cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this film. <br /> <br /> This film is quite disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such shit?
