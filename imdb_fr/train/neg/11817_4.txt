A fairly average scifi movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although the acting was pretty good, the writing seemed very clichéd, using ideas from many movies. <br /> <br /> The Basic Plot: Scientists working on a deep space search platform rescue a hunter from the collapse of the red dwarf they have been in orbit. On board, they find a stasis cell which, at that moment, has malfunctions. After 2 or 3 minutes of awakening of the man in the basket, you realize that he is completely crazy. Something that totally escapes the crew of 3 people of the research vessel ... <br /> <br /> After it becomes a scam on all the other movies featuring a psychotic madman terrorizing innocent victims, I think that overall, Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I did not consider a good movie either. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, get Aliens out and watch it again. <br /> <br />
