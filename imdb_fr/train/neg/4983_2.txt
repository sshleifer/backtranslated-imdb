Corridors of time. The movie you can watch if you are looking for a sophisticated method of suicide. Some use firearms, ropes or gas, but you want to lose your head? Do not wait any longer! The corridors of time are probably one of the biggest mistakes possible: to think that Christian Clavier is able to act and have fun. I do not miss the 45 francs that this poor thing cost me: sometimes, it is necessary to reset its evaluation system by looking at the absolute zero. This film deserves a 2/10, but it's only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also plays in Ronin. I think I will not like it ...
