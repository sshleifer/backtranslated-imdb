Put a DVD of this film in a time capsule and it will certainly illustrate for future generations the perfect example that deserves the minimum rating assigned to a scale of 1 to 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano are at the forefront - with tens of millions of annual profits - with their television series. Yet, everyone has had no success in big screen deals. This is also true of other television personalities - perhaps because many reports presented for about two hours seem better suited either to a 10-minute sketch, or at most to 22 or 23 minutes of drama. 'half a day. one hour program. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not contain any elements that would justify two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL or elsewhere on a screen or a scene. <br /> <br /> Its original date is 2002, but its release date (DVD only) is that of 2004. It was also filmed shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield. His reductive value lies in the fact that he probably provided a few hundred thousand dollars more for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of it, but I found it by lighting up my tray and I became fascinated by it. Some movies are so horrible that they assign a higher rating in reverse - that one can move the selector backward (9 or 10). "Plan 9 of Outer Space" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village People opus, "Impossible to stop the music," is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film lacks success even there. Although Rodney's previous works (as well as those of some of his colleagues) were far from "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca", there were many humorous moments and a story providing at least a minimum of interest . <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have such material, even a minute or two.
