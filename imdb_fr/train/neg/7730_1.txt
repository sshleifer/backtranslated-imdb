Despite a lot of style, flash and glitter, this French musical does not speak. The melodies are repetitive, predictable and tedious. The story is irrelevant, as are the many characters. <br /> <br /> People start singing and dancing, without motivation or reason. Most actors wear wigs and fake hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly bound by a studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end. me. It's a shame that such a final effort is so talented. <br /> <br /> This will show, I suppose, where the sequels (in this case, the classic, "Umbrellas") often go wrong. We can not recover, but only recreate.
