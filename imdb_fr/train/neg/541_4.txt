I found this film rather strange. From the beginning, I found it extremely difficult to love this film and now, after thinking about it a bit, I can pretty much explain the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, even though I like him a lot (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is pretty fake here, and although I can not count for the life of me that would be better could have take his place quite easily and make this movie work. Everything else is fine, with the exception of shots for low comedy (a joke A Meet The Parents is not really necessary, filmmakers!) And I love Richard E. Grant as a British major. He only suffers from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
