the guy who wrote, directed and looked in this shocking trash should really consider a change of caregiver. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who funded this shit? there are so many talented writers to whom money could be better spent. I think the idea is good but the acting, the scenario and the staging are simply awful! The jokes are not funny, I understand that they are supposed to take mickey. BUT do it in style, this film shouts skits live from Saturday night 1995. Why, I say again, why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk? Never give a comedian the opportunity to write live and featured in his own movie. DUH!
