I agree with one of the other commentators on a good story and good but mismatched actors, and I would also say hastily. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as it was at school. But I thought you would need to know Jane Eyre's story when you look at it, because fragments are left out and therefore have no meaning. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester barely spoke and suddenly he proposes marriage !!! Actors do not have time to let the public know what their character feels about each element of the story. The actors are good but do not have enough time to make this story fair. I'm sorry to say, but I did not really appreciate this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott would be Jane Eyre's film of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini-series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in 2 main roles. I love him so much that I watch him regularly. There is an abridged version with a duration of 225 minutes or a full version of 330 minutes.
