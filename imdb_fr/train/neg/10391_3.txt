I saw Gator Bait's movies, and it's almost exactly the same as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically takes vicious revenge on each of them. What distinguishes this film from these (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. The frontal nudity is total several times in the film, but not for a second, she is never sexy. Some scenes of rape may seem a bit long, but it's only because the film tries to reinforce the need of the public to see this woman seeking revenge. <br /> <br /> It's a weak movie, it has no other way to maintain an interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of film you hope to deliver with a serious morality, but I was happy to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on the main role of the woman, it was not supposed to be a T & A movie. <br /> <br /> It is notorious that B-series movies are motivated by the nudity and uncontrolled sexuality of teenage sexuality. , nudity does not lead the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is a futile need for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are abandoning evolution, just like in Gator Bait's films, and the biggest challenge for writers seems to have been finding new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can not never being more than a meaningless film B is that it does not broadcast any message, but merely satisfies the public's desire to see a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The problem that arises is that we have to miss out on sexual attacks. Oddly enough, the first half of the movie is the one that contains the most nudity (but not much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even a little disappointed as we watch the woman take revenge, because some of the deaths were so complex that they were obviously impossible (it seems to be pure chance that the lake guy, in the end, was felt so much desire to kiss the engine on the boat and press her genitals against the propeller, staying that way while the woman screams a few words and pulls the rope), but again, this film does not satisfy than the desire for revenge that gave us the first half. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that's all the film wants to do, because it literally ends the minute the last man is killed. The woman does not live happy forever, she does not write her book, she does not leave and never returns to this nightmarish place, she just goes in the boat and goes around the motor lake while the movie is simply stop. But, what more did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and did you read the slogan? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try to find a broken or burned man. I could not wait to see them ??
