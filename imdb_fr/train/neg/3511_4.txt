'I work for a grim industrial espionage company in the future and I'm starting to not know what I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things are staggering, oh no, here is another almost subliminal montage, a noisy editing cut out of meaningful yet enigmatic images ... '<br /> <br /> I rented this film because of the few critics they were all supportive. Why? Cypher is an inexpensive, derivative and dull film, which takes place in a world both faded and poorly realized, with wooden tracks and a laughable end. <br /> <br /> The strange feeling that an interesting event is about to happen prevents you from watching a series of increasingly ridiculous and unconvincing events, before filmmakers slap you with a ending that combines the worst of Bond with a video of Duran Duran. <br /> <br /> It's painfully obvious that they stopped production with Dr Who's style improvised special effects to include some good decors (if it would be a bit like Babylon 5) CGI. The future black thriller of this sub-club, Philip K Dick, strives for a much broader reach than his modest budget will allow. <br /> <br /> A cold blue mood served seriously, but with a disappointing stupidity. It's not an intelligent science fiction, it's the plot of a computer game.
