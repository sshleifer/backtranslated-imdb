I rated this film as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" the trailer said. Well ... that offended me, because this movie is really bad. It's not a comedy, I laughed for about two seconds during the whole movie. And what's going on with all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have any problem with those who are, but what is the point of adding so many gay scenes in a comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I guess the director is a homosexual man who refuses, or something like that. <br /> <br /> I advise you to: Millions of times, you will be better off than watching this comedy of Mother Of All Lousy Comedy. It's really total shit.
