I wonder about its importance for Queer cinema, because it seems to be more a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are mixed in a rather sloppy way. I found myself trying to unravel the messy story in the first 15 minutes, that alone did not suit me. The weak points of the plot were repeated to infinity, as if we had not perhaps had the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of padded dialogue throughout the film. Rather a 45 minute short film rather than a full length film. There was a certain erotic flair, masculine nudity and sex appeal, but overall, the sum did not match its parts. <br /> <br /> Part 1: The Boxer / Stalker plot was the strongest and yet she felt like it. pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now confronts him? I felt as if their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to deserve its conclusion. We needed more information about them and fewer parking / locker scenes with Tim saying tirelessly, "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his boyfriend, Tony, to beat him while he gets fired. Tony does not seem to care, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby - not even after making her nude. This story lacks the very important transition from "I am a straight boy who slams my friend for pleasure" to "I think I could be gay and hit him because I would like to expand his ass and do it S / M style. " A very important thing to leave out. <br /> <br /> It is clear that each of these stories could have expressed his point of view in half the time. The 3rd part with the man and the woman who slap themselves adds to this thought. In addition, it was not necessary and added nothing to the film. Yes, the actors did a good job under the circumstances and the four main male roles were very sexy. Makeup (bruises and cuts) was, however, tied with a high school talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat in this story to have any impact on gay politics. The film made no statement, wasted no time and did not commit enough and does not deserve a serious investment. His fatal flaw is his amateur approach, which ultimately makes it impossible to take seriously.
