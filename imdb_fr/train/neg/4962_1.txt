99.999% pure shit. And the other 0.001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde chick was going to undress. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. The action was nil and there was no sex (the blonde mentioned above is modestly dressed, alas, the whole film). The CGI has had the dubious honor of being the worst film I have ever seen, and the anachronisms are many and glaring. Play was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" of this movie. And Marina Sirtis really looked really ugly. <br /> <br /> I have seen high school plays playing with more talent. This is the kind of movie on which MST3K has flourished. Sci-Fi should let the heads roll to allow this pile of steam to steam.
