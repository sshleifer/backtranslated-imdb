It was just terrible. I read this book at school, I did like all tests, and see it like that! My teacher forced us and 20 other people to watch him, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Outer Space Plan 9 and Hudson Hawk together. The thing that made this movie so terrible was reason enough to want to kill itself. First, it was done on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I asked myself to apologize. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Follow my advice, do not watch this movie. Nobody would want to watch that. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
