The screenwriter has badly tried to recreate "the exorcist". But you added a blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you busy. There is no substance in this movie. This has the potential to be special. Extremely boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this, but the silly movie tickets were expensive and so I had to resist the painful torture that seemed to last forever. Nothing on the screen connects the relevance to the characters' words. <br /> <br /> They use here synthetic images which, instead of taunting me (as I wished, I hate computer-generated images), have further ruined the film. Some people say that this movie was horrible in the movie theaters because of the way "arouse thought" and "slow pace without action - because it's a smart movie", it was. What is so smart or thought provoking when the story is fundamentally about pretty boy H eath Ledger as a priest who has a lover interest and disobeys his religion? It looks like an uninspired concept. Oh, and there's a little gibberish about the "sin-eater" (the movie was originally meant to be called "sin-eater"). Blade concept but the film took the "sin-eating" too seriously, making the film pathetic and delirious about its darkness and intelligence. Yes, I know that there were real sin-eaters in medieval times, but this film feels like it's going to be corny. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was executed properly and I forget why I even bothered to see it. If you want horror movies that really have depth, look at Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, The Naked Blood, Society, Holocaust Cannibal, Pine, Exorcist, Omen, or any other Romero movie "Dead Trilogy". A senseless dialogue is not synonymous with intelligence, but the big movie fans think so (same type of people who think that a film as ridiculous as Hulk is a cinematographic masterpiece). If you want a terribly boring horror, watch the Order. This film gives the church an air of roller coasters.
