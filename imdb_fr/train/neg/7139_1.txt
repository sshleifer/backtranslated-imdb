Redline is an imitation of Fast & Furious, without any of the qualities that redeem it. It's not necessary to have a complicated plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING! It's the equivalent of a porn movie, where the script and the dialogue are composed of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same thing at the end. Except it's worse, because you do not get what you pay for. Impossible, incredibly boring race sequences, and a terrible waste of expensive expensive cars, which almost get negative points for appearing in this movie. Of course, she is hot, but who is desperately looking for a woman on the screen? I feel as if the director was sitting with a hat full of dialogue and plot excerpt, and shaking a ball each time they changed scene. No serious person running or who knows nothing would watch this movie and enjoy the racing scenes.
