Steven mate, remember what you said: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without hurting others." Live with integrity and morality, no only with people, but with all beings. " <br /> <br /> you did not do that, you mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these "movies". I would not mind if I did not know you were better than that, I saw the videos of your teaching, you are so much better than that why my brother why ... <br /> <br /> Steamroller productions have been steamed I promise that I do not fear my brother, I will tell you the truth on your face so that we can fix it. <br /> <br /> well, others fell asleep to 90%, but to be honest, I was tired and I had a good meal an hour before Sensai help, what are you doing. 12 millions? really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000? It could have been in the theaters and a resounding success, if you wanted, we could have given money from the huge profit made to a shelter for homeless or something like that. These post-production people are scamming you man, the choreography was nonexistent, we can do better, the blinking eyes came from the men of the film noir, I half expected Smith to appear or Tommy Lee to to tell you they were not hooked on their eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal you are a master of Aikido, why are you doing this to yourself, to ourselves? when you arrived on the scene, you had a direct style so fresh, and it was obvious that you are a teacher because your actions were so clear and clear, watching your first three films, I felt like you learn something, now I feel like you're being scammed or something that seems necessary to save you, this time it's you who've been killed and I'm going to take revenge on you helping you make the best movie of all time. I know who you really are, I know the truth about the movie Nico. let's talk about it. <br /> <br /> contact me dude, I have new ideas. I am a word finder, I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we will do it for the fans, your fans. better deserve, we hang on, but the shutter is about to snap. I swear I will not let your movie go out the door with one mistake. I'm still trying to figure out if it was the worst dubbing of all time or if you have laryngitis, but I promise you that I can make a better impression of your voice than the lame **** who did not even not tried. I hope you hit him in the nuts as his payment. I can tell a story and a plot that can go along with your revenge for the death of your student / girl / woman / dog / house niche and I promise you that we will bring you back, I promise, also I want to go into the direction that makes people think, if you let me in, I promise that we will make a film that people will leave and that we need to discuss it, an experience that provokes reflection, that changes perception. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal This is my official written permission for IMDb to provide you with my contact information in order to resurrect one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen. For information, he is not Italian, he is Irish and Jewish. you call it a bad game, I call it great, because you think for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) change your perception a little, is not it?
