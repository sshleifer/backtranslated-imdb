As a veteran of many pretentious French films, I thought I had taken the worst of the industry challenges and could endure anything. But not that. Useless, implacable, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and presents a random hatred and aggression disguised as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
