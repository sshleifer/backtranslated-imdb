What I think I like best with the new Star Wars movie, "Phantom Menace", is that it will probably bring down "Titanic" water, if you want to forgive the pun, when it This is pure devastating box office receipts, and so get it out of the first place. Every time I hear someone say that "Titanic" is the biggest film they have ever seen, I say, "You do not see a lot of movies, do you?" What a parody. You could make 50 good movies that are way better than "Titanic" and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, he has won many academic awards, many people really liked him", someone could say in his defense. Well, a lot of people love Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that does not mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans MAY be wrong. <br /> <br /> I'll be the first to admit, this part of the problem for me was the mega-hype around the film. I waited about a month to see it and eventually it did not meet expectations, which simply drew attention to this appallingly stupid love story. It is true that "Phantom Menace" will probably suffer the same fate. but. <br /> <br /> "Titanic" of James Cameron is. a) a cheese action finely disguised as a genuine period piece. b) a three-hour epic that presents its best moments in the trailer. c) A love story undermines beliefs or entertainment. d) there is something better for documentary filmmakers, which I would have liked better. e) a film with arrogance at the level of the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a flight of 3 hours that I will never find again, so the greatest motivation for a machine to go back in time, which I can think of. When I meet someone who has not seen it yet, I tell them, "I wish I could exchange seats with you." g) a slap in the face of a real victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in icy water and form intelligible sentences? h) Fortunately, a film that has not been recognized for its Oscar feats. i) a technological achievement in the field of cinema and little else. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm posting this comment as an anonymous comment is that I'm NOT thrilled with the rebuttal of the 10,000 13-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio fans, who will undoubtedly come in his defense, and I'm not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting, or duration.
