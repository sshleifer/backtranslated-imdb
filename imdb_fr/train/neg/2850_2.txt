If I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have watched it. It's humiliating for the Japanese, unhappy for Hollywood and embarrassing for anyone thinking. But then, most of John Wayne's movies are like that. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The film deals with Japanese isolationism of the nineteenth century. Maybe it's Hollywood that should be isolated. To put it as succinctly as possible, this film is appalling, which is a jingoistique puzzler.
