James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he has never played a role in this hogwash. Affleck is just a light weight that just can not cut it, the rest of the cast is really unforgettable. I saw this in the United States in an empty theater, I quickly understood why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went out before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when, in England, I saw the film issue a glowing report of this yoyo "Paul Ross" in one of the falling Sundays of the market. I'm still counting on Ross to save money on movie tickets. If he says that the film is good, I go directly to this site to consult it. This film should have gone straight to Â£ 1.99 DVDs in a supermarket near you.
