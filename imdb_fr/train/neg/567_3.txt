This film is one of the most terrible films ever. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer and not an actor, he kills vampires with his guitar? And what about the plot? O my God, this movie is really bad. At the end is the queen of vampires incarnated by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade), surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" killers arrive, there are only 4 vampires left !! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? They run in the sun ??? And what about the "Big Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head with a shotgun ??? It's really a "PAS". In "Buffy against the vampires" in 100 episodes, not a single vampire is killed by A SHOTGUN ??? It's really a lack of originality!
