It must be the scariest and most twisted holiday movie I've ever applauded, and it says something. I know that Mexicans have strange ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their day of the dead is not as scary as their interpretation of Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So..Santa is not a jovial, fat, and red-faced alcoholic (take a look at those pink cheeks one day!). Rather, he is a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in paradise (or in heaven, as the case may be), with a group of children working more than those in sweat shops of Kathy Lee Gifford. They sing so cute traditional songs from their home countries while wearing so stereotyped clothes that I was surprised to see that there was not a black-skinned African-American boy singing "Mammy". This Santa is a pervert voyeur who observes and listens to everything that everyone does with his "eye in the sky". It's for him to know who was mean or nice (focusing on those who are mean, I bet). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Claus, no elves (why does he need elves when he has child labor?) and reindeer are mechanical toys to put together ! This floating monster show hovers over a cloud, probably held back by its silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis is ... the devil ?! What is it, Santa Claus our Lord and Savior? Bizarre. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his henchmen, a pillage and prancing devil named Pitch, to try to mess up Christmas. Let me understand: the purest evil forces are trying to ruin a wholly commercial and greedy holiday? It seems superfluous, right? <br /> <br /> The height is totally ineffective. He tries to convince some children to be bad, but he is not very lucky. The scenario of the little girl Lupe, whose family is very poor, struck me a lot. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but her parents can not afford to buy one (they spent all their money on the cardboard they built their home with). So Pitch tries to encourage him to steal a doll. In reality, this is the only way for a poor girl to get a doll because being holy and praying to God and Holy Santa does not really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to take you behind her. She is rewarded with such a hideous doll that you know it's Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> On the way, Pitch manages to catch Santa Claus stuck in a tree (uh-huh) from where he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You are laughing at me! Since when do mythical Druidic characters appear in Christmas tales or do they have anything to do with a Christian religion? And does not God disapprove of magic? They would have burned Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, without asking him to come to the rescue of one of the aspects of God (or that's what I guess Santa must be, to face Satan). This film is a long HUH? from start to finish, and you'll wonder if that you're not getting the eggnog you've been drinking or anything like that. Probably, since this film looks like a long giant DT.
