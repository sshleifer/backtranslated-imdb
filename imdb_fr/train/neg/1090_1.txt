it was the most useless movie I've ever seen because there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the movie had absolutely no plot, I laughed so much that my ribs started to hurt me. the little where old men when capturing Robert Duvall was ridiculous. At the level of the realization, to make a film noir does not imply a lot of rainy sequences nor useless close-ups on the main character. This is an unsuccessful attempt to create a black thriller that alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. Since this was based on a "manuscript" by John Grisham, I do not consider this to be one of his adaptation books to the film, as it presents no suspense or captivating script like such films as "The enterprise "or" the rainmaker ".
