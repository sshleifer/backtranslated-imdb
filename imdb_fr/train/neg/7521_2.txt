I probably give more credit than he deserves because it's Halloween, I was just at "Knott's Scary Farm" and I was in the mood to watch a really ridiculous movie about Halloween. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it only cost you a dollar. <br /> <br /> Usually, I live a movie like this to talk about "good stuff", but I resisted the temptation and still do not know why. It was obvious from the early plans that it was not a "real" movie, not even a serial movie. It's more in the category of "horror movies" DeCoteau like "The Brotherhood" that are shot for about 50 cents (in fact, I was half scared the minute one of his beefy s 'extinguish rubbing in his underpants or something). There were no sectional plans (too expensive to make multiple camera configurations) and flat lighting, but ... it's hard to pin down. It's refreshing to see a director without money shoot a half-decent movie. The fact that it does a decent job is commendable and that this film has its advantages - the acting is not bad, the photography is very good (if too bright to be scary), there are some surprises, and the whole thing is sort of ... different in some way. <br /> <br /> A group of students is (for some unknown reason) stuck in the warehouse where they decorate the annual haunted house. A scary old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally call the powers of hell. Thus, people dressed in the haunted house become what they are imagined and cause a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way, we are treated with a strangely complex and thoughtful second intrigue - it is interesting to note that this couple seems to be the most complete of the film. Yes, there is a sex scene but it's not salacious - or at least no more than what is found in any legitimate lesbian movie that shows that they have sex. It is rather unusual for a horror movie to take the time and effort to do it without resorting to cheap operation. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this issue that was important to me was how she was clearly trying to imitate the mood "stupid kids have sex and get killed" slashers It's hard to accept because there are so many films that already exist, the genre was made until death. I do not know if it is good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in this genre, without irony, as if it was still a genre LIVING, but I appreciated the attempt. <br /> <br /> That's why I sat through it; Sometimes you just want to watch a horror movie "without effort" and without a budget. There was really too much editing, not enough gore, endless intrigues, dead ends and clich√©s and the unfortunate impression of a film that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the movie that the producers were considering ... but at the very least, the scenes of the haunted house were pretty cool. I would pay to go to this haunted house if it existed, and I did not mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD even though I would never watch it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** spoiler possible **, but the vampire girl in the coffin had very good deals: "I was claustrophobic, but I changed." Ha ha, good.
