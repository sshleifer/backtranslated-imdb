Although I'm generally a fan of quality film, I'm not limited to films that escape these boundaries, and most of the time, I enjoy and admire movies that "break the rules". And it is absolutely true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But I also think that he does not break them successfully or in fact. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is discordant, but it is less about what is really on the screen than the film, and the nervousness of his films seems less a question of artistic choice than the result of an amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini has often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable results, under his direction, his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to shock, offend or disconcert the audience. Such elements can often be used with surprising effect, but in the hands of Pasolini, they rarely seem to actually contribute to the film. This is also the case of DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I've been taught to understand that many people like and even admire Pasolini's films. Nevertheless, I have never met any of them and I have never read anything about Pasolini or his works that makes the reason for this affection or admiration understandable. Judging by his work alone, I think it was essentially an amateur filmmaker who "did not break the rules" both by choice and lack of skill - and who was initially applauded by "existential audacity" , thus confirming it simply in bad habits of filmmaker. I find his work tedious, unimpressive and pretentious. And this is also true of DECAMERON. Unfortunately, this is also true for almost all of Pasolini's films that I had the misfortune to suffer.
