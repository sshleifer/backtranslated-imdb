Some children go hiking in the mountains and one of them goes to a large tunnel and discovers an old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so crazy that it goes crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A boy and a girl are in their tent and think they think they hear something outside. The guy will investigate and find another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend screaming so they go back into the tent - they arrive the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet! <br /> <br /> 2) These two imbeciles then hear another girl screaming (What, 100 feet?), But do not investigate because they are afraid of getting lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another boy and a girl are walking around and during their 10th scene together, they inform him that due to the circumstances, the protocol no longer forces him to address her. as a teacher. I mean, what is ...? First of all, it's a really stupid thing to say, secondly, he never called his teacher in the first nine scenes where they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and stops him, telling him that part of his gladiator training has taught him to hurt without killing. Uh, yes, we noticed that she was hurt and not dead because she got up and walked. But thanks for that information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is tied up in the Den of Demonicus and when someone tries to free her, she orders that person to seek help. Look, you fool, if she released you, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to ask for help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on. The whole central part of the film happens with the two idiots who get lost in the woods, then they fight, then they plant a tent and ignore the shouts of their friends, then they walk a little more. It's so boring and useless that I turned off the DVD midway. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are friendly, especially those who enjoy most of the time on the screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, wrinkling his face in the diabolical air. He runs, or should I say scampers as he is gay. The special effects are comical, the acting is mostly horrible and nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, this concept might have been able to produce a pleasantly campy film if they devote more time and effort to getting rid of ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with real likeable personalities, follows a logical sequence in action and perhaps even makes Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiatorial outfit. But no, instead, we have this pile of crazy nonsense that will bother you to death.
