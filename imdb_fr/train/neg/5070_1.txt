Television influences society ... just look at the rise in popularity of cappuccino stores after the start of this little superficial job. In addition, real people who look as good as these people have no problem. <br /> <br /> In addition, does anyone really think that these people can afford to live in a beautiful loft in Manhattan, considering what they do for a source of income? NBC just likes to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if it's right at Gump's level. I know someone who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2,200 a month in rent. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Phriends, where six ugly people are working in dead-end jobs, living in a shabby neighborhood where sirens are constantly lamenting and someone is being attacked each time. week ... then the landlord increases the rent. Now that I would watch.
