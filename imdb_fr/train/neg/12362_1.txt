I saw this movie in New York. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining and did not want to wait at PORT AUTHORTY. So I went down the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad that I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I have not seen anything so bad since. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I only stayed because I could not believe it .........
