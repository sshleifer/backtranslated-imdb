The show is average. That does not make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really reduces it. She does not look natural. She has these three ways of talking, all robotized. She speaks softly (without intonation), she speaks normally (without intonation) or does the same thing when she starts to speak normally and starts shouting gradually. However, his screams are like, "Let's say I scream because I should not be too strong on the set." <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress who does this fun thing. It's boring. You can not really get your personality because it does not really produce emotion and does not get worked up. She has this husband who does all these stupid things and she does not react. Acting very dry and simple.
