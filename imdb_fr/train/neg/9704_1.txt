Ok, if you have two hours to spare, or if you really hate your life, I would say to watch this movie. If something is good for some laughs. You not only have obese and topless natives, but also special effects so severe that they are probably banned in most states. Seriously, the 'PG' rating is pretty funny too, once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this film to my late nephew. You can not even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and clich√©d, and dumb, and stupid. The acting is horrible and the end is so painful to watch that I started to pour salt into my eyes just to distract myself from the idiocy that fills my TV screen.
