It's the same old, "If I can not get funding for my project, I'll inject myself" movie monster. There is nothing new here. It sounds a lot like Jeff Goldblum's "Fly" movie. The man manages to keep a semblance of mental health, but ends up succumbing to the effects of his experiences. The acting is pretty bad. There are people who act stupidly along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy keeps going back to the lab where he was forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he's handsome, but he seems to have a lot of problems. It's just a big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaur costume seems to have been out of the rack at a Star Trek convention.
