To be honest when I heard about this program for the first time, I guess it might be a bad idea to make a show that incites Muslims to make fun of race jokes, but it's exactly the opposite. I realized that the show that is made can help people understand that if a Muslim uses such a word in real life, it does not mean that it is a terrorist act. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype. By watching the show, ordinary people will realize that even though there may be bad Muslims, that does not mean we're all bad, we're just trying to live. One day at a time, for example, it was difficult for Amair to fly and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser saying that we would eliminate competition and people would have taken it badly. As a Muslim, I know that this kind of thing does not usually happen, but that's what's happening and a lot of people think badly of Muslims, Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not just. people will see how badly we are treated by watching this show, and this may inspire them to think about how they are doing. I'm glad a show like this was broadcast. There are many shows that the Piotr are Muslims as terrorists. Many people find them funny. My opinion is that it's okay to do it from time to time, because we do not care much about whoever makes fun of who we can say you can not make fun of it. unfair, but it is done too often and really gives the people of Muslin a bad name.
