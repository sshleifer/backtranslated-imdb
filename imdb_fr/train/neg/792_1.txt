Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving home, talking to new people, and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. However, after watching an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my fortune began to change. After episode 2, I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and feeling talented. When the series was over, I ran the sales department at work, hit a plethora of women, and often won the karaoke contest in my local. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and you do not know where to turn, take a trip to Poundland and take the DVD, it's only 99%.
