I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror movie. When a terrorist body, infected by a stolen chemical, is found by the US military, the body is then cremated, which releases the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon, infected locals turn into hungry zombies of flesh, and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and embark on an abandoned hotel to try to fight the aggressive undead. I did not find this film as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still a good horror movie with good deeds. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
