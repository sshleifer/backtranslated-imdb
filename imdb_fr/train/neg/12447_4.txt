Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but she was still a frightful "actress". Unfortunately, she hangs out with everyone (including then = her boyfriend in real life). But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to play in this one? to be a real snorer. It's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. Add to that annoying, bad acting, even from the normally good Eastwood. This film ranks at the top of the list of natural sleep enhancers. A film can be MUCH more boring? I think watching the paint dry or growing grass could be more fun. .
