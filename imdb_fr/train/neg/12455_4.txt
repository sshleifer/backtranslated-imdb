I remember watching her in prime time when I was about 7 years old. At the time, I was a great comic book reader and everything about superheroes was highly anticipated. The end result, however, was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was aware of Diana Prince's "Emma Peel" stories, because they had just ended and Diana has regained her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was almost bored throughout the movie. The final suit was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the film again at the end of my adolescence. It had not improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was not better. The scenario contained some good ideas, like Amazon dishonest and a villain worthy of Ricardo Montalban, but he had not met and remained boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. It was too much like a sweet spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The Amazonian elements intrigued, but had to be developed. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in forcing the producers to come back to the table and to propose something more faithful, although a little too camp and with low budget. . The budget was also pretty low here, and the superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the film available on DVD, if only for comparison and as a historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and he has nothing on this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth visiting for reasons of curiosity and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.
