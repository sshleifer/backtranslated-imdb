My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn a parallel between it and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even proposed it as "also recommended" if you liked "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I like that. This is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people I have worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" in that they are both movies. This is where the similarity ends. We probably sat for the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, no, praying for it to get better. It does not have. We could not, and stopped the tape. Thank goodness it was a free rental. I would have been surprised if we had paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to get through. Now, since we have not seen the end, maybe it miraculously combines and redeems itself. I doubt. <br /> <br /> The Haiku Tunnel is so severe that it is hard to believe that it has ever been produced. The film is so funny that it's painful. Just post the letters friggin already !!! The premise is asin. The jokes are awful. We arrived as far as the scene "the printer is not working" and had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Office Space, do not waste your time with this shit. 0/10
