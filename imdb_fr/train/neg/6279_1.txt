No, <br /> <br /> Basically, you look at something that makes no sense. In order not to ruin the movie for the people who really want it, take a look at the movie, I will explain the story. <br /> <br /> A regular everyday woman walks down a street and then walks in her own car. She follows her and many events took place during this period, among which she and her family. <br /> <br /> I specifically made an account to comment on this film, how horribly it was written. The acting has been great, the events have been great, but history has not brought it anywhere - it could be dramatically increased and become a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the author was trying to accomplish by realizing this. Generally, at the end of the movie, most of your questions get answers, but this movie asks you what just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes just passed for nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spoiler's beginnings <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. This was not explained in detail throughout the film, and you never know how it happened, why it happened or when. Nothing is explained during the film. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally understands everything and runs away (his sister's boyfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, I threw it right after .. do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing will be redone.
