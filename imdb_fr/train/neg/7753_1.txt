Everything in this movie is pork washing. Pitiful acting, awful dialogue, ugly indigenous girls. this film dark in oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had to be a weekend. Robert C. is totally lost and has no idea what's going on. College students are the worst. No acting talent, very stupid reasoning, and just dumbbells. The special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the land of toys: with stupid looking weapons, walkie-talkies that are useless; and a computer system that stores with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing is working; why bother to invite potential customers until everything is finished. screenwriters should be the first victims of the mess with the producers and the team. The whole movie belongs to another planet to be viewed in a septic tank. What a jewel. Convicts should have to look at this in order to commit suicide.
