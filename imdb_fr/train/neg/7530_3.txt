I found this film boring, monotonous and rather uninteresting with a quick and upbeat "optimistic" ending that did not sound true to the overall story. Following these characters for a weekend of terrible events, hostile attitudes and bad news just is not my idea of ​​an interesting and watchable film. I'm really fed up with its "one note" theme and I could not wait for it to end ... In fact, I almost stopped halfway. The whole movie just seemed useless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, even though the acting was good. A small film with small ambitions and a small attraction - sorry, but it was not successful with me, and I love the good, the little movies! It just did not spoil, although I watched it with hope and hope that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local critics put it on their "Best of the Year" list. I strongly recommend you to watch "The House of Sand" instead - now there is a good little movie!
