Carlo Verdone has already managed to combine a superb comedy with an intelligent and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened. He simply became another dull director "more hero than you". <br /> <It Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summed up in a line "working class = nice and warm, while the upper class = snob and sneaky but love wins in the end". <br /> <br /> Like a real shot for such a smart director. <br /> <br /> There is really not much to talk about in the movie. Each character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who will become "good" again, his despised wife, the rich and rebellious girl who cracks for an honest but poor guy ... It's just playing way. <br /> <br /> Gravely disappointing in all aspects.
