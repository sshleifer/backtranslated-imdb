Usually, any movie with Sylvestre Stallone will usually suck the ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception. The only movies in which Sylvester Stallone was good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extremely unrealistic and boring. There is action, but not very good action. I did not like looking at him and I would never look at him again. No wonder the movie won the Razzie Award for the worst photo I would give it a 3/10, the only reason it got the 3 was because the action was pretty good, but not enough.
