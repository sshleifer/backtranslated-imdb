Some beautiful landscapes, but the story itself - in which a self-styled Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) travels to Egypt and, while doing Egyptologist things in the most non-Egyptologist way (eg, flash photography in the tombs, handling old parchments, etc.), discovers the black market war and one way or another (in the space of two days, no less!) becomes the epicenter dressed in the combination of war - is more confusing than any enigma that the Sphinx ever posed. Down is simply horrible as a visiting British scholar (she seems to know nothing about Egyptian culture and even less antiques is the fault of writers, but it is boring because everyone gets out of it is entirely his fault) and the rest of The cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as confused as I was aware of the procedure. In short, not what you expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and others. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking for a ridiculously dated scene in which Down trainees all the scholars, blaming them for it. failing as a university student, while bathing in the softest light Hollywood could muster. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the movie shouting and moaning and throwing herself into the arms of any type she can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to future Egyptologists: Take a year or two of Arabic at the university. It will really help in the long run ...
