A remake of the beautiful movie of the 1972 play, beautifully depicting Caine as the nemesis of his character in the first film. But do nothing at all nicely. <br /> <br /> An underlying interpretation of the actors, Law and Caine, further diluted by a weak and indulgent leadership. <br /> <br /> The heat of the setting in the original is neglected for an ultra-modern home. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, which made the first film lookable as well, is replaced by a horrifying, brutal arrogance that instantly engenders contempt for the viewer. But it is not the intelligence to go to love one then the other character that the original has so favorably favored, it is about an obvious assassination of the character of OTT since the word disappear . <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not worth seeing, watch the original movie and let yourself be dazzled in the first act.
