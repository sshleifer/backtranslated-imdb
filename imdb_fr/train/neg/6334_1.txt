I saw this film in 1979, I was 17 or 18, when it came out. The theater was perhaps a full quarter at the beginning of the film. Ten minutes after the beginning of the film, me and the friend who accompanied me to see the film were the only two people present in the theater. The movie was really weird and had no plot or reason for its script and people asked to be reimbursed. We decided to stay for the film ENTIER .... why endure such torture ?? ... here's why. We wanted to be real movie critics. It's hard to justify that you've seen the best movie (a 10) because they always offer something better. But, it is easy to be able to base all the other films on the worst film ever made (and that's it ... a 1 at best). There may be other films that really qualify as a 1, but I have not seen them yet. I now base all the movies I see on a scale based on this worst ... I AM A REAL CRITICAL OF FILM ... there he.
