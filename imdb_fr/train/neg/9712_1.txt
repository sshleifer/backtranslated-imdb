This film is one of the most distorted representations of history. Horribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous slave laborers that the sadistic Japanese have killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "on the bodies of the white man", as stated by the chief Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors are the source of a movie where the bridge itself is not as accurate as the bridge itself. The current bridge was constructed of steel and concrete, not wood. What about the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and everything it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dysantia, starvation or illness are deeply hurt by the film that sheds light on their dark times.
