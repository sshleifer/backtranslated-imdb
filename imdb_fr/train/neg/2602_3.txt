Drew Barrymore continues to see his alter-ego all over the city and it really starts to become a pain in the ass. <br /> <br /> After Dee rented an apartment to a writer, her encounters with "the other Drew" became more frequent. Writer-guy thinks it's his responsibility to pull the real Drew out of his stupefaction, so he does what he can to help seduce her as soon as he has free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy, as usual, especially when she points to a group of rude construction workers ... yes Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best scene is where Drew stabs his real life, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
