You do not know why this movie was presented as a wacky comedy, fun and fun. There is not much in this film that will entertain or entertain the viewer. Annette Bening (whose acting has been presented as Oscar-winning) is here as usual, with her performance that seems like a routine. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and irritating, and the main role is Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? just does not seem to have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to endorse this annoying and unsavory movie. <br /> <br /> The film disappeared quickly and it seems rightly. I found some unpleasant scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and his rivals just used toilet), some of the worst scenes of 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' and 'The Squid and the Whale'), some embarrassing and most disturbing them. I found the entire experience a waste of time. Do not waste your time ??
