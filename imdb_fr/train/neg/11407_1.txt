This film is the perfect example of an excellent book that is ruined by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no scenario, the intrigues disappear and the writing is awful. To top it off, the music comes directly from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly awful. Bridget Fonda's acting is correct, but the acting of all the others is totally amateurish. I would suggest this film to someone who studies the possibility of becoming a producer to study how not to produce a film, because it is jam-packed with bad cutscenes, bad transitions and actors that should have been shot! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
