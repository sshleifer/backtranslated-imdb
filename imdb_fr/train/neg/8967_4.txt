Follows the same path as most suites. The first was great. The second was average and this, full of bad acting and stupid dialogues and many suspensions of disbelief, this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I could not stand that Henry Wrinkler - like a boss with that silly eye, there was so much more than they could have done with that. I loved the first one. I would have liked them to do more in this way, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were too many unexplained explanations to explain, what time period was it and why is there an old-fashioned telephone in this room? <br /> <br /> I understand that another phone is in preparation. <br /> <br /> Blah!
