What is supposed to be a mysterious generic conspiracy involving a deceased philanthropist is actually a head-telling narrative that speaks of a group of Assassin characters among a small cast of residents in a posh residential building. These characters range from totally stupid to downright average. As a cheap and low-budget production, the action revolves mainly around Rogers and his boss (who does not care who he is because he's really nil) talks about their various possibilities of solving the problem. crime while being constantly cut by an absurd detective with the head in the buttocks. Honestly, I have never had less trouble watching an old movie of this type at b-rate, and I've already seen real head slap. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler did not, because there was no butler. But be careful of the guy who is closest to a butler. Here. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
