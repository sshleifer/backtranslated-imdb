absolutely trash. I loved Halloween and from that moment, Johnny found himself in a hellish spiral. it's about pits. we get it john. Pro-life is scary! you do not have to make a crappy movie that annoys me a lot to "tell me". <br /> <br /> The pace is far from here. It's like John does not have much to work here. to his credit, it looks like he did not write this junk. There are innumerable times when the camera sits down and waits for the actors to look stupid or say something silly. I like the long haircut. Too bad the carpenter does not know how to use it. he needs to bond with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please John, stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death!
