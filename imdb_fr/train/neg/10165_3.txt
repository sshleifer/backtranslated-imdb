San Francisco is a big city with excellent acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers did not try to use the city. They have not even managed to handle the most basic basic details. So, I would not recommend it to anyone based on being a San Francisco movie. You will not think "oh, I went there", you will think "how a burning armpit on two floors has turned into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the tracks used speech styles and East Coast assignments. It's bad, but the acting has always been good. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The history of Chinatown has been the most effective and the most interesting. The plot is weak, torn scene for Hong Kong's action-packed movie scene. The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and punctuated better. But playing is fun and we see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the white boy was futile. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they left the film badly structured and reduced it. The father is a strange attempt to be a Berkeley Liberal - in fact, everyone knows that it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. They have thrown good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the west coast, a yuppie jerk is a type of jerk yuppie different from the one they make in New York. They are also intolerable but always distinguishable. It would have been interesting. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Hunter's Point was the most disappointing. It was the most derived from the three and stylistically furthest from San Francisco. You have seen it before and better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-location and the scoreless scenario, these characters have potential, the actors have talent and something interesting begins to make its way in the awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the end. Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, it misses a minority here, see if you can guess which one.
