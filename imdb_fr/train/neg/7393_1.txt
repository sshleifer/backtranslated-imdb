I am a big fan of Steven Seagal. God, I probably weigh as much as him, although I do not have the merit of wearing the curly ponytail. Having declared my own bias and fondness for the hero and hero of the storied American favorite scene, I must declare that this is his worst movie of all time. I'm not sure he can make a movie worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the major problems of this film seem to arise in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this film was supposed to have a different scenario. This translates into lamentable voices in which Steve's voice almost does not synchronize with that of the doubled voice. The editing is mediocre and, overall, it starts badly, gets worse and, in the end, you may want to revisit The Da Vinci Code. Yes, it's so serious. <br /> <br /> After that, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends always laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time that I start looking at some of the nutty discs directly on Van Damme's DVD? If you are tempted to watch this movie, tear your eyes and throw them in the toilet. A life in darkness is better than 89 minutes.
