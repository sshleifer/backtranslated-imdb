I like silent movies, but it was a bit too stupid. Although I wish I could say it was worth it, I can not get up. I do not think any version of the film is close to the book. And do not try on the kids, they might panic. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that the labor laws were different at the time ... BUT COME TO PEOPLE.
