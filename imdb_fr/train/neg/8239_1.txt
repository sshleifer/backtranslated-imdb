It's really the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I just do not know how anyone has the audacity to publish it. <br /> <br /> The production standards are atrocious. There is no pretension here to cinematography. The work of the camera, the script, the acting and the sound are incredibly rude. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes saving us the time to look at it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this room have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I invite anyone to avoid spending time and money on this title. It's really atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
