Just look at the sets, the staging and editing to say that this project lacked an adequate budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is designed to change your ideas. Brides fall dead in front of the altar after saying "yes". The famous horticulturist Lorenz (Lugosi) and some of his spooky monsters steal their bodies while his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of glandular liquids from young virgins to stay young forever ... to stay beautiful. Luana Walters, an enthusiast of local baby publications, realizes that each missing wife wears the same rare orchid as the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be the most informed. A storm of typical horror movies makes visiting the Lorenz estate a little scary; especially with a dwarf and a drooling hump on the spot. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
