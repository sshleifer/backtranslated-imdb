Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I've learned from this film is that having a foolish over-control to go to the cabin at the weekend may not be the best idea after all. I loved the way Bill rolls easily from the car and down the hill without getting hurt! Unfortunately, the same can not be said of his daughter. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or find the owner of the wreck. <br /> <br /> Many driven scenes, including an ordinary stripper (still have nightmares of this scene). Poor assistant and his useless hand. I admit to being intrigued to see what mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when she appeared, I just laughed. HAHAHA !! The girl really looked sadly angry at being revived. Personally, I would really like a new body after an excruciating experience like this one!
