When I go to see movies, I stay up and I watch or, if I did not like it, I went to sleep, but it was pure shit, I got up and went out! ... It was a mediocre script and put together, I hated it. In addition, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier, he was much better. It was not as good as expected, since I really liked George of The Jungle 1 a lot and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example, the bird, and every time it was collapsed in a tree. I hope that the director of this film will take it into account and that during the production of his films, he will have to reconsider his decision ... horrible! I would really like to give Ursla a job well done, because she made the film worthwhile (until I went out) ... All in all, I give this film a 2 out of 10
