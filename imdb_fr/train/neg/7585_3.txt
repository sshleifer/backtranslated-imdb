I like watching the first color movies. Do you mean that these clothes of the 40s were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this film. Her "eccentric" costume is actually quite attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass size. But I think she had her head a little too much. She probably developed this characterization on many performances, and no one told her "If you enjoy laughing, give it up." She is too foolish when she is supposed to be down-to-earth. Ms. Arcati's joke is that mediums were generally described as vaporous females in a long drapery. Arcati is behaving like an outgoing director (we'll really put her back on it!). The contrast between his simple and banal way and his crazy beliefs is not really highlighted. <br /> <br /> Just because all actors are English (except Cummings) does not mean that Americans think they should use the words "Brit", "stiff", "lip" and "superior". Oh, give up! The three main characters constantly get carried away and make risky remarks (Did he make love to you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
