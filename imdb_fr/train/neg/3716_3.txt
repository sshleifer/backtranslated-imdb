The main character Lance Barton is killed and in heaven before his time. When the sky learns the error, we give him the body of Mr. Wellington, a dead old man just dead. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old body of white mans still behaving like the young black man is perhaps funny if you see him done by an old white actor. In this movie, I ended up remembering many times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white man". <br /> <br /> The concept as a whole does not work as expected: "the illusion" is not well conveyed and the love story is not credible at all. The fact that all you see is that Chris Rock plays a young black, because the old white man that everyone is supposed to see only appears in small scenes, is a real challenge for viewers: "suspension of disbelief".
