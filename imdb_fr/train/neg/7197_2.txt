OKAY. I think the TV show is pretty cute and always has a lesson. So when my kids decided to watch this movie, I decided to follow suit. I would have liked to stay at home and watch the show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is ridiculous and unoriginal is the least of the problems in this film. The plot is almost nonexistent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and, worse yet, Gadget contains no lesson. It seems that Disney has taken everything that makes Inspector Gadget work on television and has thrown them all away. To be fair, my youngest child (8 years old) liked the movie, but the oldest (10 years old) went on to find him silly (he was too old for the young people's humor but too young for the humor of the adults). In general, I like Disney movies, but this one misses by far. It's OK for a very narrow age group (say 7 to 9 years old) but it's a must for everyone.
