Usually, I do not think Hollywood productions are worthy of being called movies, so I call them "movies" instead. But this piece of elephant dung is not even worthy of being called a movie, hence the title quotes. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, this is the perfect example. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play less than half of her age, she must play at 18 and she is forty! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid portrait of Paris and France without spirit, where we see characters of clich√©s such as: the friendly owner of the grumpy shop, the queen bitch of the models, the fairy deity, the old queen of models, etc. respect by Da Vinci code (which critics have correctly determined as a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It's very ridiculous not to have nudity in a film about an era and place where nudity was such a common place, especially if you focus on it. <br /> <br /> 4. The horrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The elevator music of Nana Mouskouri !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that's enough. And I was able to make these observations after watching this shit for barely half an hour, while surfing the internet and discussing mathematical equations with my friends ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
