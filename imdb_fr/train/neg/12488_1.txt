0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The acting game is among the worst I have ever seen, which is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the small budget is hopelessly obvious, the score is awful, I would not say that the film was mounted, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate sentence. It combines serial murders, voodoo cards and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. ridiculously bad everywhere. The writing was terribly bad. Cinematography is really inexpensive, and sometimes very grainy, and the work of the camera is appalling. Once again, what really matters in the film is how bad all the actors are. Nerdy.
