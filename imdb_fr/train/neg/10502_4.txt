The film has several stories that follow several different characters. The different stories do not give the impression of being a complete piece, which makes this comedy very incoherent and even annoying to watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> It may sound weak and cliche, but it's true; You're much better looking at the Crocodile Hunter series on Discovery with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie. I'm sure the actors and the technical crew had a lot of fun making this movie, but the film does not give the viewer much pleasure. For a comedy, it's just not funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie and their scene is long, distracting and useless and sometimes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The film had a lot of potential, I mean Steve Irwin is a character that is strangely both intriguing and hilarious to watch. So, when I first learned that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter, my first reaction was: brilliant! However, the film suffers enormously from its weak history and its incoherent stories with characters without interest and without laughter. The film has some recreational value, at least enough to make this movie visible at least once, but I certainly would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a waste of time. time. Nevertheless, it is possible that this film is visible only once, when it goes on the television one rainy afternoon. There are good times, but intrigues completely ruin the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
