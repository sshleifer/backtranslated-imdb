It's a confusing film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sex between men and women is demonstrated to be degraded by a group of men and women who can only be described as a collection of silly things and marginalized people. <br /> <br /> recognizes Greenaway. It is inspired by the film "8 1/2" Fellini, but while Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He does not have the lightness of the maestro nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a skill of clarity. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer was to be guided in the film, except that the written opinions remained lit. screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience, so they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as spectators, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest is commonplace. Both women and men withdraw from the raw light of reality in the fantastic hues of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway obviously wants to make it clear that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. The women themselves are depressed because they render their services in exchange for money. Relationships between men and women are degraded into a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy, happiness or love in the film. In fact, several scenes are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The cruel contempt of the two men that Giaconda carries their child, she gets pregnant twice, the first fetus being aborted and the second time she is sent back to a destination chosen by men in a logbook. Both men have sex with a woman without legs (half woman in the title). The bestiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son share women with each other. Women enjoying being sexually beaten. The father sleeps with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately none of these scenes are shown sexually. It is only referred to. <br /> <br /> The alleged weakening of the woman is such that it is not surprising that the film was booed at the first screening in Cannes. What is more extraordinary is that the actresses of the film lined up to defend it, demonstrating once again that there was no limit to the naivety of women and that women would fool themselves into themselves. exploited by men. <br /> <br /> The style of Greenaway's director is pretentious, it's a triumph of style over substance, a representation of the film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to reach the sublime of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relations.
