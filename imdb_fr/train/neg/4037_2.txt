I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result is eloquent: The Shield is virtually unassailable. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, The Shield's performances are excellent ... <br /> <br /> In reality, the show is so badly organized that you can not even really see the performances. For example, editing removes reaction photos before they have had their full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the intellectual reason is, but it deprives the demonstration of any emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give The Shield a point of ambition, but that's about all I can give him. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see so many talented performers wasting their gift in a strangely badly filmed movie.
