MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I sat down late and watched this movie, mainly because I appreciated and noted some earlier work by Singleton as "Boyz n the Hood". However, I must say that it was a major disappointment and that all I hate artificial films, clich√©s, said "message". <br /> <br /> The acting is mainly poor (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors ... take note), situations difficult to swallow (the victim of rape becomes a lesbian overnight? ... please!), but the worst of all of this reinforces every broken stereotype you can think of. From the second half of the film, it became a cartoon, which makes you lose all the empathy you could have for its one-dimensional actors. <br /> <br /> No valid argument was made about the causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, this only makes the results of these problems sensationalizing. His message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of cohesion in the plot. Regarding the conclusion of the film, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a film entitled "Higher Education", I must say that all I have learned is to avoid seeing this again. <br /> <br /> If you want a faithful comment on some of the themes on which this film has no precise idea. then hire "American History X" ... unless you watch for Tyra Banks, then hire a life.
