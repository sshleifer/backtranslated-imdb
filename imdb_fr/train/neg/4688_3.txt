To let the class look at it in English was a bad idea. Serious and more educational films can have an effect, but it seems that it had no effect on the class - every time the teacher left, conversations started quickly - and I did not hear them. "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" being used at all, and when you look at that, it's easy to see why, there's nothing special about the acting game - everybody looks bored, just reading Shakespeare has always preferred revealing dialogue to action and death, but I just could not understand a word someone was saying. "The costumes are not too bad, neither are the effects. Specials - the class may not have liked the movie, but it has not taken either, but it's hard to joke in front of a film that lacks inspiration or joy. of the movie were not badly prepared - although the rain seemed a little ira list, everything else was done well. But where were the cut heads and the masts exploding? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been taken much more seriously if he had worn clothes - but as everything was presented, he was just another excuse for a joke. This film does not appeal to any sex. Women and girls will have no romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and a lack of action or death that will discourage most men and boys. The Tempest was not bad, but it looked like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And general boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
