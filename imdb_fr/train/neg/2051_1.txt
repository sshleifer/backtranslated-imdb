Since there was nothing wrong with the acting, etc., the writing of the episode is very different for this ghost of the series or for no ghost. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series, whatever is happening, it's not true and what's happening really has nothing to do with the story of the series, with the exception of the meeting with the Martian hunter and losing 30 minutes to do so is by far another case of bad writing in the Smallville soap opera. I really like the show, but mostly because of the distribution and the 3 or more good episodes of each year, but it is necessary to put in the canning the casting which is appropriate or which already worked on the serials. It was by far one of the worst. With the first 4 minutes, you know that what's going on is bogus and all that's happening is a dream based on Clark's infliction, which is obviously caused by a character from the ghost zone. really create a villain who will advance the frame all week long. May also have added another villain to die in the last episode in which the Martian hunter was and made him fly again or come back and tell Clark that he had forgotten his sunglasses to get closer to this episode and call it a day.
