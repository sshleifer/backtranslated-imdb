Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I guess if a teenager wants to become biblical with another teenager, it's his eternal damnation - just remember the kids, "birth control" does not mean " oral sex ", I do not worry about what the honor student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's help is presented as a "somewhat romantic type", he is only flirting with a high school girl. If she were my sister, I would eat this type of kneecap. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I discovered that the Mongols do not embrace the French and that the baseball players named Zoo look like delicate underwear. <br /> <br /> I think I would rather look Richie Rich once more than suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slop. Thanks and good night.
