Wow! Only such a ridiculously awful film could inspire similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? The undeniably horrible theme song? The non-expressions of Pia Zadora in the film? The fact that although it is established in Los Angeles, nicknamed "the country of the casting", ALL the singles (and the women!) Do they dream to sleep with Pia Zadora, by all the artificial means necessary? Or what about the fact that each person in the film is totally unfriendly because she is either stupid and stupid (Pia), or a despicable and despicable sleazeball (everyone)? And since this film was written by real "scriptwriters" (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who would hell admire and kiss in front of a SCREENWRITER?) <br /> But it's (unintentionally) as funny as hell.The scene of "breakdown" will make you laugh alone, and after seeing the climate "I'm not the only one to have had to go to the top". " Rewards "(all done in the usual level of acting we expect from quality personalities like Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia has actually reused this speech when she" won "her Golden Globe. my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of bad camp, go for it in this rotten movie.
