Even in a bad film, there is usually a feature film, something that can say yes, it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, it was just terrible. The acting was laughable, the dread scenario, accompanied by many inexplicable lunches at Tiffany, and even the special effects were of poor quality. It was a very bad movie and even one that Drew Barrymore wanted to erase from the story. Look at it if you want: a) Suffer from severe self-inflicted pain. b) See how bad a movie can be. It's a movie where I can use the clich√© "ninety minutes ago of my life that I will never come back" with a justification!
