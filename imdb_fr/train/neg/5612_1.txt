As a spiritualist and not a Christian. I thought I was really going to keep my faith, but what a load of seers. I thought the film would have good arguments, but I only have views on one side of atheists and Jews ??? And who are all the street people he interviews who do not know the back of their arms? Where are theologians, priests and stuff that he could have obtained arguments? They are not retired dimes who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and was not worth it to check if the facts are right or wrong or if I have to or not believe, because an antichrist told me then. Please, think that he has come to the conclusion that he does not find God, because his own ego and his own demons have triumphed over him. No, I'm not going to say that the movie was stunning to help atheists who read this text feel better. But if you really want to show the world that you care about us, poor souls who believe in Jesus, draw us by your value and not by your drumbeat.
