I have watched a lot of cartoons or animated movies because I have a little girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I would like my little one to look at it ... and no. At first, I thought it was a film as cute as Bambi's, but it was like insinuating that the duck was a homosexual. The info said they were making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but he was not. It looks like a movie made for children to learn to be gay. It was also very sad for the duck's father and everyone. I do not know, I guess if you're gay you'd like, but I do not think I'll watch it again with my kid.
