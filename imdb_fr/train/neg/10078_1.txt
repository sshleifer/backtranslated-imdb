A love story between boys and girls, but this time it's the punkette and it's the right arrow. Movie lovers really like this movie? He has fans? I must say that spirits change ... "Grease 2" is a really lame business that does not even have the guts, the mocking or the courage to destroy the memory of its burning predecessor (like "Jaws 2" or " Exorcist II "). No, he moans in slow motion and often plays dead. It looks and does not feel expensive, with a big distribution lost in a messy direction and a fuzzy handling. It was the first time that an important audience saw Michelle Pfeiffer and, even if she is not embarrassed, it is a role worth remembering. A failure at the lowest level. NO STARS of ****
