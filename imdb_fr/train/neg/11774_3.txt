Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well filmed from the beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the movie. The acting was awful, I wonder if the girls gogo were hired But it's the plot that was really laughable, in fact it was ridiculous and not boring, that's the only reason I gave this rating of 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <I would just like to mention some of the scenes that really made the audience laugh: <br /> Push the girl on the ground: who would have thought that a child who pushes another child might to be played badly. A real revelation. <br /> <br /> The climb on the bus: the girl gets on the bus. But, according to the music, the world is ending. <br /> <br /> The rolling thread under the clothesline: Wow, this one really demonstrates the skills of the plot. In the room, followed by the sale of raw meat and skills. Why not just ask him to do the three sins at once? At least the film might have been slightly shorter. <br /> <br /> Go down the stairs of the shopping center: watch one of the girls go down the stairs pursued by a carnivorous Dau, without waiting. . she * walks * quickly trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> The race covered with blood: it is definitely my favorite scene and a good end of the film. A half-marathon in red paint, completed by climbing stairs and on the bridge, to be sent faster by a passing car. Not only that, but this suicide is committed by the most obsessed girl in the movie, now it sticks to your character. <br /> <br /> I would like to believe that this movie was created 16 years ago old and their friends. Unfortunately, after meeting with the director during the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're sarcastic and you want to laugh with some friends, do not do it. even think about it.
