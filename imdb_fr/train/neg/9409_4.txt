I liked this show! I think it was not bad with that! Only this Spidey does not hit anyone but only so that the show is not bad! Some people think that this show is bad because of that. The story was excellent and fun when other heroes appeared, such as X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Too bad that Sandman never appears, but I like it! Best Spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Spinning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Extraterrestrial Costume 5. Mutant Spot Program that was embarrassing to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First of all, Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it annoys me that he is almost the main villain of season 2. Of course, I must mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I prefer to see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey like the spider-man! <br /> <br /> But I guess everything was bad!
