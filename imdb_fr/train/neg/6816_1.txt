I have to say that low-budget movies have no problem, so that was not my problem. My problem with that is that I felt like I was watching the movie at my neighbor's house next door. Everything that happened at the IMO was like a guy writing a story, grabbing a camera and starting shooting. I understand how difficult it must be to do this effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I hope I feel like watching a type of professional-quality film. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge summary, is a great actor, and was fine in this movie. The other people who were there were not. I understand how fun and less expensive it is to use friends and relatives as actors, but that is not convincing. It looked like the way it was shot, it tried to give many scenes a more interesting aspect, but when writing, intrigue and acting are there to start, this type of style does is not necessary, and it's a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also technically, digital artifacts were scattered there. In the first scene of all these beautiful cars, when they read them slowly, they seemed to make a small movement back and forth. The problem does not lie in my viewing equipment (diagonal Benq PE-8700 84 "), but somewhere in the production I've never seen this kind of artifact in a professional quality movie. as they did not comment, which is acceptable unless it looks like the track of this movie, but the microphone built into the camera.
