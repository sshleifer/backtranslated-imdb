Filmmaker myself and with a sense of humor a little dark and subversive, I told myself that I had to feast when I won the title "My Wrongs ..." (although the cover of the DVD does not betray nothing, quote from controversial director Chris Morris, "a short film with scenes"). I should have known better and avoided this insignificant (and often offensive) piece. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is disgusting to watch (especially since we all know Morris's twisted attitude towards pedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and has no other purpose than to shock. How is this movie called comedy that I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The runner's commentary sounds like a new idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and unhindered prospect of the film making process), However, is unfortunately not the case here. Instead, we are treated by a public schoolboy commenting on the dogs in a movie, before concluding that there are not really any good movies featuring dogs. All this is very interesting, but not worth a single image of celluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is not going anywhere would be a euphemism. He relies far too much on his high style, to the detriment of intrigue, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unsatisfied. His overly simplistic message, that man must take responsibility for his actions, is both flagrant and poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism, but it ends up not convincing, entertaining, enlightening and ends up being irritating. If you want to see a very good short film, I highly recommend "It's a wonderful life" by Franz Kafka, Peter Capaldi.
