Yet another example of the complete waste of UK lottery money. How successful has this film been in advertising? The Film Council, which financed this miserable trash, should be blocked, on one of the decommissioned stations of the subway of London, for allowing this gloomy specimen to be filmed, a half-mutant thing composed of all the films of horror seen by the director and felt fit to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins, there is the obvious inability to make the main character sympathetic from a distance until the last minute. It's a little late then! All those responsible for development, at the British Film Council, could have noticed it at the scenario stage. Add to that the dramatic game and laughable appearance of the creature and you get a great example of how not to scare.
