This film reminds me a lot of anti-drug films of the 50s and 60s, because it was made by people who have obviously never lived the social scourge for which they warn us. Tom Hanks and his buddies play "role play", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you're swept by a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the band's wife. pretty funny but misplaced. I wonder how many poor children saw their D & D equipment destroyed and told that using their imagination was the path to destruction. As a film, it's basically an after-school activity, of poor quality (although Hanks shows a bit of his talent) and interpersonal discussions, and no one seems to be having fun . It seems that these films focus on teenagers who are starting on the path of adultism, which is apparently more serious, and requires you to linger and do what everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2, it should be watched because of its unique genre, the scare movies, which I personally find quite funny.
