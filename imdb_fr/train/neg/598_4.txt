Please be forewarned: this movie, although a very bad screenplay, was one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen ... EVER. Just remember that before you sit on your couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> It's officially a party begins. Just your average party but there is a guy there. He likes Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> So anyways, Kate is going to get George Clooney (did not I say the plot was bad?) and take the hit. It's the London Underground in the middle of the night, but it's just as stupid as that. The schedule therefore indicates that the next train, the last, will come in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, stupid party girl she is, decides to take a nap for another 7 minutes. In general, she misses the train and finds herself trapped in the London Underground. Only. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> The film continues from there. The blood, intestines, limbs and even parts of the body that I will not mention are nicked, nicked and possibly amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a typical horror; pretty but thick lady in women of distress and sick type, weird psycho. If you wish, you can use Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say you have to try if you like Saw, Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the rest of us, Scream the horror needs a lot of thanks.
