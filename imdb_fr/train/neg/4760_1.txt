This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic play did not last long in movie theaters. Having recently suffered cable, I am still happy not to have wasted money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law said their prestige alone could support this parody of 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine reinforces his reputation by playing the supporting role in the wonderful film of 1972. He now seems to intend to destroy it by trying in advance, interpreted in this version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but were lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Caine, puffy and faded, slips across the room with less depth than he did. shown. He had already presented himself as a guest in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What is the next step - ALFIE II, or SON OF MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? <br /> <br /> But then, no one takes advantage of this senseless adaptation of Pinter, who thinks that frequent curses and an added sexual angle can compensate for the lack of spiritual interaction between Shaffer's characters. The direction of Branagh rests on a bluish lighting and a decor without soul which does not resist in a nightclub of second order. Neither shadows nor tight, overworked close-ups can help Law overcome his dull screen character. The result is a failure both as a drama series and a crime thriller, almost obscuring the purpose of the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and the Olivier / Caine Film would do well to view this business as a bad dream. The late Mr Shaffer, who wrote the screenplay of 1972, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several adaptations of Agatha Christie, must be turning in his grave, wishing to plan one or two real murders!
