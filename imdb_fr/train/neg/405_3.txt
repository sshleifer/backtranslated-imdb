This film is worth watching if you like to marvel at the special effects. There are some interesting visuals. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this is the typical 90s / hollywood fare, a dazzle without substance. True to the title. <br /> <br /> The story does not deserve to be separated. It's like performing a brain operation on a dinosaur. There is not much to start. This is nothing original and not very special. So do not go into history at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the end was a little flashy, thus diluting the purity of the high-quality treatment of an invisible (and sometimes half-invisible) man. However, if you ignore "classic" fireworks, it's interesting to see (or not see). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a decent FX movie that is worth seeing for this purpose.
