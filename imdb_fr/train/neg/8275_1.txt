(First, excuse my bad English) Of course, only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious blunders like this one. I am a Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked. research on the making of this American / "Norwegian" film. Even Wikipedia is more specific about the facts about this country. <br /> <br /> I publish my corrections because of my frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. - Norwegian priests never use these black capes with this white paper around the neck, because the Protestant church is dominant by far - It is true that we have traditional folk dress (which we only use twice a year) but holding this film is more like a German outfit. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica did not make sense .. neighter did not do the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the Viking hats, but it's so stereotypical what people think of Norway - vikings !: Oh that then) <br /> <br /> Well .. I guess the people who have made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clarified some things and eliminated some of those frustrations ..! <br /> <br /> I'm proud of my country and I would be delighted if the Americans were less stereotyped and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That's all .. Lenge leve Norge! ; p
