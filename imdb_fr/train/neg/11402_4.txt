Exactly what you expect from a B-Movie. Nakedness, gratuitous, boring in some parts, ridiculous and gory special effects. Of course, it could have been better, better interpreted (definitely) better written, realized, etc. But then, I guess it would not have been a movie B. The actors were rather nil. In fact, it looked a lot like an episode of Buffy the vampire slayer, or something like that, with the exception of a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> <br /> We must distinguish Tiffany Shepis. She is absolutely the queen of the cry of the new millennium. It's not that playing in these movies really matters, but she was better than all the other actors. She is also very exciting in this plastic wrap that she wore throughout the movie - wow! Her ass is absolutely beautiful in this outfit, I mean that every time she turns, you can help, but look at her. And toward the end of the film, the viewer is rewarded for seeing it completely ignored. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a horror b-movie buff (like me), look at it. Otherwise, you should probably avoid at all costs.
