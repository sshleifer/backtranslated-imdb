It's been a long time since I saw this comedy and I forgot how stupid it was. I would easily put it in the top two or three of Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a MÃ©tis Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the ruined hut where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long. Her parents are Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and her former Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything of substance, comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's livestock, but it lacks a bull. Elvis sings only a few songs of no value and is pursued by a girl crazy boys and his mother carrying weapons. This is just a real blunder, and rundown environments almost smell manure and do not make it much easier. The only thing that bothers me, though, is that Elvis seems to actually have a good time in the movie. Hard to believe, considering that he was so upset at being stuck doing so many mediocre films.
