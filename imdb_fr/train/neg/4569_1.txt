I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so hard to attract attention that it would be embarrassing to allow this show to take place there. This show is like a slap to the real hard-working law enforcement officers. I have never seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had presented it as a comedy, it would be one thing, but to say it is that reality is nothing less than a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled by what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy go after a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing in the series was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the chief of police and all the officers should be head down and never want to admit that they come from this city. No wonder he did not stay on TV
