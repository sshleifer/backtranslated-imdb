it seemed a strange combination of Withnail and me with A Room with a View .. sometimes it worked, sometimes not. The tragedy is that they changed the name of the American version. Keeping Apidistra Flying is way better than the title Nothing A Merry War. playing was good, the script was fine .. all in all, it was a mediocre film ..
