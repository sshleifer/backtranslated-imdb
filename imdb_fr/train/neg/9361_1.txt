When I saw the preview of this on TV, I thought, "Ok, it's going to be a good werewolf movie" but that was not the case. it was not scary at all! playing was good, the plot was horrible, the military bid was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI chain could do better than this shit. The film gave the impression that Arron was going to turn into a werewolf. He turned to the psychopath and bit down a doctor's throat. If you've read some of my other reviews on other movies, everything is positive, but this one is not just because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. I'm sure you're all waiting for a werewolf movie, but I bet you did not expect that. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie, heck, any movie on the science fiction channel is better than this movie.
