** WARNING: SPOILER POSSIBLE ** <br /> <br /> If you manage to understand an extremely unpleasant topic, this movie offers a huge amount of scandalously campy melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and scammed several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand which director would be inspired by this trashy tragedy. None of Hemingway's women can act here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the unique touch of class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and hilarious like the mean little smile of the boy. The room. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk handbag from the texts of this sow, which is full of dialogue and extravagant situations. For example, the last sequence, where Margaux catches his shotgun and chases Sarandon after his last shocking act, is supposed to be exciting, but rather gives rise to good laughs. Add to Michel Polnareff a particularly piercing and catchy score, and you will experience a real guilty pleasure, even if you risk to feel dirty and to need a hot shower after seeing it. Do not say you were not warned.
