I like all types of movies, especially horror. That said, Survival does not respect the hype surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can not give him any point on his originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or redoing what others have done. He has just become a cop for independent films to take us on a staggering journey through the woods, a crazy killer, and for some time now we have been putting in a crazy family. On these lines, I have to compare that with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though the twist in this one is obvious) and others. Survival is much lower than that of comparable films. The plot was just not original. Some films can cope with a weak (and much exaggerated) plot with great actors, special effects or a host of other factors. Survivial does not have anything to rely on. If you want, note the following: The game in the movie never took off. I do not hit or blame the actors for that, nor the director. The dialogue was mediocre at best, and the actors involved never showed (did not say did NOT) the talent to achieve it. I mention 2 out of competition. The main man of this film certainly has the look, but I seriously think that he must consider more training before being able to make a film. The actor who represented Greg also had potential, but we have never seen (watch the film to see why, you will not believe it ...). <br /> <br /> The grainy look of the film. Oh yes, this little movie making magic designed to take us to the heyday of Grindhouse movies. In today's cinema, it has become a gadget. It works or not. In this case, it just does not work. There are too many other flaws going on, which ends up distracting the movie, without adding anything to it. That being said, I think they did a good job adding this grain. It's good quality grain. I think that with a different scenario, a better direction and possibly actors, they should try another "Grindhouse" attempt. They will probably succeed. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects, in my opinion, they have never been so gelled for me. You might have taken better care of the audio (it looks like it was directly introduced into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and for being filmed in DV, it's was too sweet for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about it .....
