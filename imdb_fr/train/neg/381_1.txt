This movie is a traditional bollywood dish going all the way to star star, sentimentality and emotional love triangle. What really bothered me in this film is the absurd notion of the surrogate mother of the creators. A whore who conceives a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is also not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I saw Indian films and TV shows made 10 or 15 years ago and dealing with this issue in a smarter way. The concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most Bollywood movies are not supposed to be plausible, but they do not claim to be either. This film wants us to move with the characters, but that can not be done with such a ridiculous and artificial conflict. I would expect better from Abbas and Mustan.
