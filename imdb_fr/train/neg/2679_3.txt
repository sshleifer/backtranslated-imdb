(SPOILERS AHEAD) Fantastic Russian "actor" (and I use this term vaguely) that I have been trying to watch for over a year. I finally got to the end and now I would like to make no repeated effort. <br /> <br /> To save two hours of your life, I'll tell you he's plotting - a guy who has the ability to throw a long blade from his arm goes home to see his mother. Things go wrong after being beaten by the mafia boyfriend of an old girlfriend. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl back home. The mafia mother of the guys sends his men revenge while the police begin to look for him too. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock up their identity girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part, is entirely off screen. The film is essentially a guy who looks like Adrian Brody who looks intense and does not say anything, kills people (off the screen - most of the action happens outside of the screen). screen). It looks good, it's played well and if there was any reason for what's going on, it could have been a good movie. Hell, I would have liked to have a sense of development of the real character or a story back (all we know is that the guy was chosen as a kid). The film lasts almost two hours and it looks like it's six o'clock. If they were not going to tell us anything, they could have at least speeded up the pace, so it seemed like it was going too fast. No, we have the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the walking hero, the hero who seems troubled. Hero with his daughter. It really pissed me off, because I think it could have been a good movie if they had just done something or if someone had said something meaningful, other than giving instructions to "get this guy" . It's about four o'clock (all my attempts to see this), I will never come back. Only for those who want to see a Russian action movie with very little action
