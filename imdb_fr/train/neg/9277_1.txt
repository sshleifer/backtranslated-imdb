I saw the omen when I was 11 years old on TV. I enjoyed the trilogy. So when the chance to finally see a movie in the cinema came up, I did not let it go. I went to the movies knowing that what I was going to see was not a movie release, but a movie made for television. However, being a fan, I could not resist. But this film of Omen that I saw during a projection at midnight did not bring chills, it brought laughter. Laughing dialogue such as "it is written that if a baby cries at baptism, he rejects God there". What nonsense. No decent decorations. Faye Grant So Good in V is wasted with this hell script. No surprises and no fun. However, I burst out laughing a few times when we were wrong. Really pathetic. 1 of 10
