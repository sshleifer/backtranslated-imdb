Around 1800, a stupid and wealthy guy wants to go to a nearby psychiatric home to see how a reputable doctor cares for his patients. Despite an initially hostile response, he is soon cordially invited and goes around the right doctor. And, as the doctor tells him, he speaks and speaks and speaks! And as he speaks, the loonie is unleashed here and there without anything particularly productive. While there are SOME actions here and there (and some of them quite disturbing), it's amazing how much of this is brain and brain - lack of life and energy, which is odd for horror movie. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses up like one gets pretty boring. The longer the visit, the more disturbing it is until you realize that the detainees have taken control of the hospital and are torturing their guards. Again, despite this twist, the film is incredibly lifeless in many places - especially when it is moving very slowly due to a strange ceremony going on or people just walking around the set. It is only when asylum workers found in a prison cell, hungry, that the film has a real impact. Given this plot, it's hard to imagine that it's boring, but the authors of this cheap movie did it! Now, with the same script, with competent writing, acting, and direction, this film could have been interesting and valuable. <br /> <br /> You know, now that I think about it, it was the plot of one of the episodes. from the original TV show "Star Trek"! You know, the one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are held captive by this madman and his crazy followers. <br /> <br /> A final note: the movie has a lot of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be forewarned - it's not for kids. In fact, given the value of the film, it is not suitable for anyone! However, with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the print is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this flesh since the print is very dark.
