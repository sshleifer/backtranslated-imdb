It could have been a very good movie, if I had been able to watch it. The handheld camera was very dynamic. From the opening credits I was worried. Many of us watching the movie were very nauseous at the end. But we stayed until the end because it was a charming and interesting film, giving a glimpse of the young South African pop culture. Black and white film has strengthened the artistic sense. The acting game seemed very authentic. Part of the dialogue was a bit difficult to understand, but a theater filled with non-South Africans seemed to find most of the time funny. If you have motion sickness, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It's quaint, but not worth the nausea.
