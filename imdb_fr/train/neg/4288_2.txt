since this is part 2, I then address it to the first part ... <br /> <br /> The man who was in many strange places ... too many jumps in time, etc. <br /> <br /> say I was really disappointed ... <br /> <br /> only a few lame spots of action ... and that's it .... <br /> <br /> they could have done it better .... <br /> <br />
