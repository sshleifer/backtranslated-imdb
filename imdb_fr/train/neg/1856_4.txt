I am so happy and surprised by the interest in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to movies produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment and, without exception, everything this company deals with is pure shit! First, and this is very important, never look at this sober film! Why would you? Unlike many other terribly bad movies, this one was done intentionally. I can not understand how the guy is a fake, that's why he is always shown briefly, his way of moving is the best! Waaaaaaaaaaaay is a better film than Michael Keaton's shit, because it was also made to be a good movie, and this version is as bad as this one.
