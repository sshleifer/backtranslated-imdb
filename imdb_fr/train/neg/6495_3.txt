I rented this movie on the background of the trailer, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, that would be the end result. I do not think I saw a movie like this that gives a trip to LSD an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a set of shooting scenes in which the characters spring from the reality, or various realities, and the film does not culminate in the last 5 minutes, where suddenly it takes everything its meaning. On my blog of movie reviews, I wrote a scathing review that reveals everything, and I will not do it here. It's a well-played movie, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Let me say this: if there is a feature film that is redemptive in this film, it is music. It's fine. Some dialogues are incredibly good and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I really liked some parts of this movie. That's right, and once at the end, you'll really understand what's really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to go crazy for 2 hours to reach a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not the acting, that's all.
