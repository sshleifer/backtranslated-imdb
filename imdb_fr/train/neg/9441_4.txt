this film was banned in England? Why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done much worse before and continue it since ... <br /> <br /> this film presents all the basic elements of a decent horror of the years 70 or early 80s movie. Pretty girls (who can not act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible storm with a torrential downpour, a fake, a crazy brother wandering in the family estate and, in reality, a pretty good turn at the end. but forbidden? seriously. when the English parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed jokingly against the past and the caution of the English. <br /> <br /> There may have been two minutes of total screen time devoted to violence and violence (which was greatly underutilized). there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but nothing else deserves to be banned. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if filmmakers had a decent budget. in the state, the film is entertaining, but the lack of image quality and sound harms the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
