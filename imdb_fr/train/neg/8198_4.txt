Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or every film that starts in Roswell, New Mexico, is zero. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with everything on the beach, The Andromeda Strain, the Raiders of the Lost Ark class stage and a throw in a small Stargate. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this film. Of course, with the original plot, they amplify gore and sex, right? Nope gore is a wink and you miss a deal and sex is a tease. (James Spader mentions in a causal way that he needs a shower and that the delicious Leslie Stefanson asks to join him ... he refuses it.AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if a film had need a shower scene to animate things up that's it. I mean, if you have incredibly beautiful women in white swimsuits wandering in a research base in Antarctica, why do not you go bankrupt? <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of real emotion in the entire movie, Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow on a sci-fi adventure. He needed a better plot to animate him. In addition, Alien is a horribly clich√© artifact and has almost no time on the screen for someone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also inquired when viewing the motif "Children corn in space". (Note that since Jason's famous Friday 13, Hellraiser Pinhead and this Leprechaun have all traveled in space to shoot nubile teens, why not the cornfield?) Be alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> It would have been exciting and apparently against this alliance in the cinema. The role of actor is generally satisfactory since Spader resumes his role in Stargate while Stefanson and Janine Eser play the latest Antarctic beachwear. However, John Lynch read the entire text and acted like a crazy villain long before the story indicated it. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me worthy of a real Children of The Corn in Space Movie.
