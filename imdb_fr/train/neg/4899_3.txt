After Harry Reems' teenage girlfriend has been raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night Walker), Reems is discouraged and consoling herself by making love to lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a cane and dresses like a magician, rapes even more women. Finally, Reems decides to hunt him down and end his criminal frenzy. Despite being shot on film and slightly naughty, it looks like any other porn from the 70s and is run ineptly. The scenes of rape / abuse are surprisingly small and the attempt to profit from "Death Wish" is laughable. R. Bolla ("Holocaust cannibal") plays a cop. Colt, who is usually at his peak, throws himself into some scenes, but he behaves too well for my money. This rough could have been a lot rougher.
