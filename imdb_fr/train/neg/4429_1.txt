What a piece of stupid guts. <br /> <br /> I will not even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth the time. The only comment that I will make is the following: why make such a DUMB, an inarticulate doofus, become the star?!? that FOX stated that it would NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series), but would bring back a deadly word like Joe Millionaire for another series to kill the brain cells of the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX lost, IMHO.
