Horrendous! Avoid like the plague. I would say it's in the top 10 worst movies of all time. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. seem to be done by the daycare students ... wait, I've seen better programs than that. Opens like a sweet porn show with a blurry naked woman doing a shower scene, then it goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that's all. Sound and light problems persisted throughout the film. Sometimes I swear I could hear the roar of the camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and team needs more lessons shooting and making films. Voted 1 out of 10.
