Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his big fiance, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking into the last minute preparations for their reception. It's the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving caterers an ear for her requests for food. But, horror of horrors, the ice sculpture "angel", commanded by Kate, arrives without wings. In a fight that ensued with the sculptor, the heavy girl "ice cream" falls on Kate and sends him into the afterlife. Now, a year later, Henry's sister asks a psychic to tell the young veterinarian that Kate would have wanted to start dating other women and move on. Ashley (Lake Bell) is interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate is coming back to Ashley, because she has no intention of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can we do something to bring Kate back to heaven for good? It's an abominable romantic comedy, one of the worst that this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, it's not casting because they try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiance and Bell has a quirky style and humor that is equally contagious. Biggs, a funny thespian also, is totally lost. As for Rudd, a very talented artist (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), he's doing his best, and that's actually the main reason for seeing this clunker. Its charm, its appearance and its easy spirit make the film bearable. But nothing can turn a stupid script and a terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you're a fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before spending money on it. Even if free tickets fall on your knees, be aware that this movie is an imminent death experience for those who love movies of love and laughter.
