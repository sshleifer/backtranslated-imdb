Horror Channel broadcasts nothing more than erotic gothic porn movies every night from around 10:00 pm to 4:00 am, but their fear factor is very limited, if there is one. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a multi-million-pound lottery more frightening than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The Bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention, as I have the feeling that this undisputed bass of a channel full of stockings. I can not even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but in order to complete the 10 minimum lines required by this site, I will at least try. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading. and looks nothing like the action on the screen. In fact, the film could just as easily have been called "Toothbrush" or "Wallpaper" for all that it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There is no leech for miles around and, worst of all, no dance, no one. I'm sure they were doing two different movies here by mistake. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate title would have been: "An excited Italian count drives five people into a scary castle and annoys us ridiculously for 90 minutes." Yes, I am feeling better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the dubbing appalling, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his approach as in his character .... /> <br /> The only graces The paychecks of this movie are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction of what every single female character removes her kit. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, keep it away from this one with a large birth. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal and horrible nature and no way on the land of God, I will never see this one again. <br /> <br /> No word of a lie, this movie could put you off animated pictures for life.
