the film seems to give the impression that the director was forced to make this film by a gang of terrorists. it should actually be called dino crap. <br /> <br /> there is nothing good in this movie .. even the actors are not worth a penny Do not waste your time watching this movie. the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality of creating such a bad movie. I mean, is not it shameful to look at people's faces after seeing his movie? the dinocroc seems to have been made in power point and copied and pasted. and it's the same old story. the man plays god. create a creature. he escapes and is happy to eat people. and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt must come and kill him. blah blah .. you will understand the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
