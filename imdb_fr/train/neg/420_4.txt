For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: go! Without the narration, it could be a very good movie / documentary. But music, storytelling and some of the stories implemented make it very difficult to find a skeptic like me. After several animals, their many seasons life gives the impression that it is an animal soap that we observe. But the melodramatic point of view just does not suit me. In addition, if a predator finally catches prey (with one exception), the camera zooms out or moves to another scene. I wonder why this happens, if they had to show the reality, why cut the scenes of a melodramatic fairy tale? I think that morality is important for the mass of the crowd, because after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
