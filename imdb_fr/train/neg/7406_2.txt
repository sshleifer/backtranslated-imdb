Well, how was I supposed to know it was "the silly promotion of Lordi Motion Picture?" I mean, I realized that when that "dinosaur" costume appeared and when the lead singer was I'm humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for me ... even though I hate this song, "Dark Floors" tells the story of an autistic girl about to be taken out of the hospital by her protective father when they and the rest of the people in that elevator are momentarily trapped ... When they get to their floor, it's quite surprising that there is no one else. hospital is empty ... With the exception of a variety of monsters that seem to stalk them for no apparent reason ... They cross the corridors and stairwells, meeting all the members of the heavy metal band in their state of shock rock costumes ... Nothing really memorable here at share the unhealthy game, the lack of gore / nudity and the totally shameful promotional side that reminds me a lot "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, do you remember that failure? If only I did not want to ... I would just recommend avoiding all those Ghost House movies and not listening to Lordi because they are a group of Gwar Ripoff!
