Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved in such shit? "First blood" could be considered a bull, but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with breasts, point. Of course, if you're interested in the story (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the Navy Seals), this is the stupidest clich√© I can think of, you say "GI Jane" is an excellent movie. Nothing but the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this film bearable, but I can not imagine that Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make this film a film for women with equal rights. It is simply brainless propaganda for the US military and, to make it even more attractive, they have let Moore down. Horrible film.
