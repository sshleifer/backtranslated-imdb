In theory, movies should be a form of entertainment. This excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film making; most movies, especially genre films, should not only tell a story or message, they should also entertain their target audience. All that to say that, in my opinion, a bad film is not a film whose production value is low or low budget, a bad film is a boring film. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Damned", as we know in the United States, is a bad film simply because it is simply not engaging, and irreparably boring and tedious. Although the premises are very good, they are simply undeveloped and the mediocre game does not make things better. On another screen, the film would probably have been a good movie B, even classic, but this is a bad movie attempt. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatry resident, who just got his dream job at St. Andrew's Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the incessant rumors of satanic practices, James decides to discover what is happening. only to find the disbelief of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes Bishop is going as crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> Although the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves much to be desired. In an attempt at supernatural psychological thriller, Jones seeks the easy way out and creates a film containing all the clichés of the genre. Of course, there are many great movies that are also full of clichés; but in "Hellborn", everyone is wasted and turned into a cheap fright to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable scenario. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the film look unworthy to play as well. Matt Stasi is very weak because the main character and the rest of the cast perform forgotten performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, there is one more thing to write about "Hellborn"; it has a very good visual appearance for the budget and looks a lot like today's big budget big budget Hollywood productions. In addition, makeup and prosthetics are very well done and the design of the main antagonist is very good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are awful and obsolete, contrasting a lot with makeup and prosthetics. terrible results. Hardcore horror or b-movie lovers may be interested in its principle but it is a boring and tiring experience. 3/10
