Eight appointments to academies? It's beyond belief. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director, Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner in the lead, I probably would have swallowed the bait and looked at it anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I feel so deceived accordingly . <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy, right? Can anyone tell me where is the humor in Prizzi's honor? It's certainly insipid (the shooting at the head of a policeman's wife is another so-called comic interlude in this joke for the mafia life), but with the exception of a joke about "your cigars Favorite Mexicans "(that Americans who have been officially banned from buying anything from Cuba in the last 50 years), I failed to spot something comical - and I tried. There are many clichés about the mafia, but the clichés do not constitute humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredible and superficial that they compare to those of Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is this a parody cleverly conceived on the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply absurd rather than comically absurd, and it usually gives the impression of a really bad (and cheap) film about the mafia. It's more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and little humor written for them, the actors find themselves making shady accents and drawing faces. Well, that's not enough; Even when the face is drawn by the master of comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (bent with swollen upper lip ... is that supposed to be a parody of Brando's padded jowls in The Godfather? ... Oh, who cares ... all I know is that it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Go in a slow and painful direction (this film drags on for 2 hours), desperately stupid dialogues and clichés such as; "You remember the Camora, well, we're much bigger, we'll find you wherever you go," snaps of the mannerisms and you'll look for that fast-forward button before you can say "capiche?". Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's "masterpiece" and is rather a last very mediocre work. It is certainly a work of the great director's canon to which a concrete coat must be attributed and thrown into the Hudson River.
