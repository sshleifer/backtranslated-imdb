Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot without any tension whatsoever. And as for the feminist controversy, it's laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and, although I found it tedious, I'm happy to have gone to see it. This is because I now have an immediate answer to the question "What is the worst movie you have ever seen? In addition, I have the comfort of knowing that every film I will see the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson. But I must admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a scenario that would reap the maximum of arts council grants from around the world (as revealed by the closing credits). I recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter pulled the wrong lessons from this movie. All that was needed was a set of frilly costumes, a few hard-to-watch looks from the star, and a cowardly plot to seduce the audience who went to the movies. So why should not she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness of The Tango Lesson?
