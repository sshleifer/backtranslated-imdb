I can not understand why this garbage has been reconditioned. The only thing that saves is Ariauna's body in her sexy uniform. His humor is also appreciated. It is a definite asset but alas, it would take a magician to recover this waste. However, she must be recognized for her heroic effort and true professionalism. I can not say as much about her co-star Lilith with her moaning voice squeaking on your nervous system. Apparently disinterested, she gave the impression that her presence on the set was all she needed. All that has been said, apart from Ariauna's performance, is really a garbage can.
