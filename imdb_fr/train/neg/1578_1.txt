Imagine, say, at noon, your home, your boredom, you are not tired. This scenario occurred about 4 years ago. I turned on the television and reviewed several channels to see that this film was broadcast. OH MY WORD is the worst movie I have ever seen! A fleeing car that can not be stopped (because the brakes were cut or something like that) to reduce it to nothing on the highway - what's going to happen ?! This movie was so bad that it's really funny - I think the stunts cost about $ 2. There was a case where a baby / toddler is being pulled from the car by a helicopter - in order to excite the viewer - a well-placed bridge is approaching ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD FILM - it shows that the child just misses the bridge but looks so bad - you can almost see the brand of the model they used - a classic low total budget! I do not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was great. I doubt they'll see this movie again. I'm so glad I could see this trash!
