Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most amazing couple on the screen since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The management of Larry Peerce oscillates uncontrollably between the black joke and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks that it is the first and his performance centered on itself in a minor role underlines the total lack of balance and chemistry between the actors of the film. Normally, I do not like to let myself take such an ascent, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time, and watching what they did with it makes me literally crazy.
