The film has only one flaw. Unfortunately, this defect affects the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> It begins with the condemnation of Israel's occupation of the disputed territories. That does not answer the reason why the Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. This is why Israel "occupies" their lands, because these countries lost it in a war they started. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel defied the United Nations by not complying with resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was rejected from its inception by ..... the Palestinians, thus rendering it null. <br /> <br /> Many movies are well-edited and can really show scenes that change minds, but remember, when you look at anything, Do not believe anything you hear and only half from what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this film are known critics of Israel and some have made many public anti-Semitic comments, thus removing any possible credibility of their comments. . <br /> <br /> All participants badly need a real history lesson taught objectively, not by a Palestinian sympathizer.
