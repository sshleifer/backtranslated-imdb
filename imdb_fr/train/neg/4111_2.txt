Think of a budget-free version of The China Syndrome led by a movie student who idolizes John Woo and you will get "Power Play". The idea was good, but the execution, the role play and the dialogue had absolutely killed him, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and disastrous sequences used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the most interesting of the film. <Br/> <br /> This is the story of a journalist investigating the disappearance of three members of a group of guerrilla activists mysteriously missing after breaking into the premises of a power plant suspected of causing an earthquake frenzy. The rather cavalier journalist, who runs into what should have been a ruthless group of corporate executives, is hunted down in the city (with everyone he's talking to) in order to "clean up" any conclusive evidence that might remain defects of the factory. Unfortunately, there is not really a sense of urgency because the characters interact with a lot of hesitation, a silly dialogue and a lot of horrible actions. Not to mention that the viewer, who can only be attracted to the film by its attraction for the kind of action, is forced to suffer a growing number of people and a ridiculous number of violent shootings and scenes of disasters. seismic. All the attention was put in the wrong place to compensate with apologies for the lack of direction and a more interesting sequence of events that should have propelled the story. It may have been better for filmmakers to focus more on a thriller and pay more attention to the development of corruption-related aspects of this story. Scary villains, a na√Øve journalist and those who try to alert the journalist of his wrongdoing. It's a formula, but at least it would have been fun.
