I should have listened. I had been warned and I still paid money for it after reading all the reviews, after knowing that the original was "so bad that it's good", and that part 2 was not do not fit into this category at all. could not resist. What exactly happened here? The first part was hilarious, she had so many political disadvantages and other crazy people, Fat Entertainment, and this one, there could be no worse aftermath on the green earth of God, not in case 2, l Hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst continuation of the story and it's really saying something, considering the revolutionary and fundamental qualities of the canons of the original. Part 2 of Criminally Insane was just another brand of bad. Shot in video, zero point, no entertainment value, 1/3 is composed of flashbacks of the original, and in addition to that, the fat and crazy Ethel has lost part of its circumference. I mean, honestly, is that some kind of sick joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
