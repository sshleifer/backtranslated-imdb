Certainly, I looked at this room with expectations already very weak. Dieter Bohlen is a talented composer whose talent is outweighed only by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> It was the first cartoon movie I watched that did not contain any humor. It's rude, offensive, redneck and obviously anti-woman. As such, it is a worthy creation of Bohlen, but it will appeal to the average viewer. No wonder he was never screened in a movie theater: he bombed BIG time! <br /> <br /> Even the 6.5 million MegaEuros charges could not save that total crap. Save your time ... and your money!
