"I just watched this movie last night and I do not think I'll ever think of any of the actors in the same way, because this film will remain etched in my memory." <br /> <br /> The above statement can be considered a good or a bad thing. I mean whenever I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think about "Some Good Men" which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think about "Tinseltown," which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I took it thinking it was something clever or at least I had laughs and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought at least it would not be bad. You can see that the film was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. FALSE. <br /> <br /> This film is neither funny nor entertaining, in any sense whatsoever. It's right there and lasts 84 horrific minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are very fine. You almost care about NONE characters, and since the main roles are two Hollywood writers struggling with a dream, they are both wrestling writers with a dream who have written this story that you must know about them. Okay, the two REAL authors know everything about their on-screen versions, so they think the public knows that too. They do not even think about character development, except to try to link their story to "Gilligan Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is without originality. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and about twenty other people live there too. The rest of the story is artificial and stupid. Have you seen "The favorite capital sins of Lampoon"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a TV writer who can not find a good story to make a TV movie, he creates one. Now replace the screenwriter with a screenwriter, turn Mantegna into boring actors by half his age, and remove the comedy and you have that movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying. Kristy Swanson is in the film for perhaps 10 minutes and still gives the best performance of the film. She's always hot, but it would help if she starred in a film instead of constantly shooting with CAMEOS. For everyone, I do not think that it is the fault of the actors, because they have the bad material. <br /> <br /> Go watch the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
