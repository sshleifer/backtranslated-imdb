This Hitchcock film hardly resembles its subsequent suspense movies and looks much more like a very old morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance which, in their opinion, will make them happy. They spend their money traveling around the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while, the excitement begins to fade and the couple dissipates and loses its raison d'être. However, when they go on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and end up being a lot happier in the end because they are enjoying life now! What a strange movie, stupid and preached! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and know if it makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later productions - an approximate film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish. acting.
