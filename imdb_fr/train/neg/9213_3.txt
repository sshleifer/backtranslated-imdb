I watched this film during a small screening organized by members of the play club of my college. We warned that it would be the "madness of reefers" of the game and this film more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who resumes his university career after having "rested" for a month. semester. What we as viewers discover as the film progresses is that Robbie was desperately addicted to the role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game with which he becomes familiar again after a band of players recruited him for a campaign. . <br /> <br /> This film is laughable in many ways. A scene presents the group "Games by candlelight", which is probably the best way to describe it. Although I'm sure it was supposed to be "sectarian" in one way or another, as most players know, it's horribly wrong. Most role play sessions take place in well-lit rooms, usually with a few gaffes and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> The acting, even if it is not of Oscar caliber, is not terrible either. This is one of Tom Hanks' leading roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two on the horizon. Secondary actors, although not very memorable, still continue to show decent performances. <br /> <br /> The problem lies mainly in the fact that it was a film specially designed for television that showed the "dangers of the game" Watch if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
