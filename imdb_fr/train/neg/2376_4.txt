George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. She is supposed to be the heiress of a fortune in cream for the face. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall in love with each other in swimsuits. <br /> <br /> It is (soon enough) that she is not an heiress. She is part of an advertising campaign for cold-cream. <br /> <br /> The film follows the ups and downs of their story. <br /> <br /> Secondary distribution does not do the job. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although it's pretty predictable, it's also pretty entertaining. It's far from being his best. But, especially in view of his obscurity in his work, it is not one of his worst.
