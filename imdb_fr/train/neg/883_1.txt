The problems with this movie are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and the most embarrassing. First, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan's life, the reality was that everything, as usual in film and television, was about something weird, usually sexual in nature. The stories were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, shot, line of dialogue, and emotion was absolutely and totally wrong. He finally reached a point after an hour of garbage so numb that I went out (something unusual to me in recent years.) I could have guessed that the film had been made by abandoned writers of a program third-level film studies, but I believe that the director (before Amelia, talented) Mira Nair took part in this tragic parody, so that the talent of American director may have descended en masse in the cesspool .
