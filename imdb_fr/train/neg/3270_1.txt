In particular, the interaction between the police was natural, balanced and worked very well. <br /> <br /> As it lasts only 45 minutes, the plot is not complex. More important is the style of the set. It is very smooth and dynamic, and the backgrounds are atmospheric, especially since all colors are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable by a foreign audience, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
