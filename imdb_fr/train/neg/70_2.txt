This film was never presented to the movie theaters of our region, and when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listen to the critics and pass on this one. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent alignment of actors, the film was very disappointing. I can see now why he went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush, it could have some value. All have done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was slow and never attracted me. I did not manage to develop a lot of empathy for the characters and I fought for the game to advance quickly. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you plan to rent it for profit. It will not be enough.
