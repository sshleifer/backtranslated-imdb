I would give him a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really, really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The scenario was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too brief and brief, therefore the moral was not clearly highlighted. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have trouble managing her role. I could see the need to put Western elements into the show, however, there are some parts where Chinese elements were also needed! The bad guy for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, not an element of Chinese culture. The last and worst defect consisted of incorrect and distorted facts presented in the series. <br /> <br /> Others might point out that it was a "children's show" and that there was no need for standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, that have been much better in terms of story development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough, you just have to rely on a series of martial arts movements.
