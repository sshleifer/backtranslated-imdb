The wonderful "Z" chain of Los Angeles aired this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it was in the 80s and I must tell you that Harold Robbin's work had been overshadowed by smarter writers. . Jacqueline Susann tore it up (she hated the way she wrote women), Irwin Shaw's work attracted many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom in the late '70s and early' 20s 80, then Jackie Collins made the women stronger and equal. to men in every way in his books, more so. That's why this job has felt. Harold Robbin's work in the 1980s did not attract public attention. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's works was like throwing kerosene on a fire. The support troop was not a help either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was horrible to watch then and again 20 years later, it seems even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and everything was shot when it was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters throws her into "Hairspray" is a spark) although she has a beautiful singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. .. Hair spray can go on tour! Join the show. You are perhaps the biggest story back to date. <br /> <br /> I only hope they burn this film for you if you do it.
