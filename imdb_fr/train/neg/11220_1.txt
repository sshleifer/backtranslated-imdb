For such a promising film, it was disappointing, very complicated and the acting game between awful and incredible. The plot featured more holes than Swiss cheeses and this is the worst conclusion I've seen in a movie for a long time. The final scene would have torn my heart if the film had not been so painful at first. I was numb! From the very first scene - we wondered if the sister was trying to get help from her twin or scared her, which would have been better for the public and we would have avoided two hours of worst acting. have seen so far. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
