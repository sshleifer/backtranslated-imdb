OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To a certain extent, it was because it was a gore film of sexual exploitation that had a lot of material excised (or darkened to become almost invisible) to escape the censor's X rating; but the film has many other faults as well. <br /> <br /> For starters, the screenwriter seems to have mixed his werewolves and vampires. The villains in this movie are hairy and do not like money, but in all respects they behave like vampires. Now, you can not do that with a shitty genre movie, you have to stick to the rules of the genre where fans get confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole conspiracy (confusing and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires, but that makes no sense in a movie about werewolves. <br /> <br /> Second, the werewolf costumes are the most lamentable have ever seen. All the werewolf movie actors need to know that werewolf costumes and transformations are a critical criticism for fans, but that some of these werewolves are simply clumsy. <br /> <br /> There are some slightly positive elements. In fact, I liked the score. Others mentioned the breasts of Sybil Danning. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also very much liked the plan of attack of the stronghold of werewolves. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case, they first acquire a very sensitive and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and will slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have pretty powerful guns these days. Should not be too difficult to put two and two together, hmm? But in a typical style, this film goes over and adds some other anti-lycanthropic weapons very zany and fun.
