Now, I'm not a movie critic, but I really hated "September 11". This movie was generally bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, the shorts were at best annoying and at worst offensive. The worst part of my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even suggesting that suicide bombers were fighting for a bigger cause. The segment was completely out of focus and, given Chahine's apparent lack of decency, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​involving eleven directors from different countries in the making of a film presenting their point of view on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
