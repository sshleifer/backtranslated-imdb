I think everyone was very disappointed with this sci-fi movie. On the one hand, he was led by Tim Burton. Another thing is a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, disgusting and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone in Imdb says it's shit and boy, are they right! If you have not done so, avoid it. He is a snorer. 1 out of 10
