Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultured journalist. The cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a vast world dictionary of films) and therefore had to hold a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left have aroused lukewarm criticism: "Tried to Part" (1996) despite Terence Stamp's sensational performance was very caricatural in character depiction, "A Taste Affair" (2000) was a slim case even though Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, "Not So Serious" (2003) was another disappointment and "A Little Game Without Consequence" is as disappointing as his predecessors. Its cartoon potential is exploited in a fragile way. <br /> <br /> And yet, the idea of ​​departure suggests a spiritual comedy whirling. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is changing in a lascivious mansion. To play with their guests, they claim to separate from each other. And things do not go as planned, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to question the validity of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush landscape and the promising material at his disposal, Rapp's undifferentiated leadership fails to bring the game to life with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-used pattern with characters that have well-known features and masks that reveal who they really are. The effects of verbal comics or situations often fall flat. A bad editing erases the film a little more with this bad habit of Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. Even the sincere contribution of the actors to the company is debatable. They seem bored and recite their texts rather than live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The public is soon caught in a deep torpor. <br /> <br /> It is regrettable to say: Bernard Rapp's films have never lived up to his intentions, as evidenced by "a little game without consumption".
