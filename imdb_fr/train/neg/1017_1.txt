Oh my God. It was horrible. There is trouble, so there was that. This film does not make sense. She is omnipresent on the map and does not understand at all what she says. The music seemed to want to look like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, disappears. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places has made it unbearable. Why did not they make a real city? The only decent writing was 'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor to have played his part realistically and not to conquer the head. It was a shame to see John Heard playing such a big villain with a lot of time on the screen, and the movie would be a delusion. Pity. I hope someone important will see it and give John Heard at least a credit for his credit, and re-engage him as the main villain, which should be his position. on the list A.
