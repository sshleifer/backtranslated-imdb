A very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention of being fashionable and modern, shown in the style of editing and some strange camera angles, causing only drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is lost, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing that is worth it is the soundtrack of Lalo Schifrin, really cool, and the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> If you can, the negative opinions and comments on this film are well deserved; it's really a pure trash. Of course that has its charm, to watch a movie on which everyone would not drop the glass of beer if it was on fire, but keep it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing to do.
