Slasher films are often considered as derivatives, repetitive and frankly not original. I'm a fan of horror movies, but this movie was so poor that I miss the words. The script is sorely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the behavior is incredibly bad. Just a complete stench, on which I lost time in my life. It had the full entertainment value of a 15th following a movie that was disastrous in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who cleared up this mess? <br /> <br /> I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was good. The second was the Australian affinity with humorous blasphemies. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this horrible mess.
