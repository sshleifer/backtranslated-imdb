... but I regret to have seen it. Since ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and they must have been on Netflix too), I guess I put it on my waiting list because it's presented as a comedy sweet from the UK, a category that produced many movies that I loved. immensely. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of laughing comedies that are generally populated by Hollywood films produced and made by people without talent. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress and I have loved her in other movies. The concept - a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the shortage she faces after the death of her husband - does not offend me. Despite the hard work of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat (it could have been funnier) with regard to me and my wife. Be forewarned, O reader, offbeat British comedies do not all succeed. This one is a failure.
