I will never be a member of a club that would have me, especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mother / stripper who gets attacked by a <br /> <br /> woman vampire and left for dead. She begins to thirst for blood and meets John Savage. Looks like he's wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wishes to let Andreef join his little family of vampires <br /> <br /> composed of a British vamp, the blond vamp who is </ strong> > attacked Starr and a dwarf with green hair (I do not do that <br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> <br /> and Starr's son. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage it was a tragedy. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his time on the screen exposing more facial tics than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender, and he reads all his lines like <br /> <br /> he's shooting a Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff tries to play the lead role <br /> <br /> poorly written, but writer / director Ruben claims <br /> <br /> all vampire clich√©s, like Starr eating his son's hamster <br /> > <br /> and buy a lot of raw meat to fight the appetite of the blood. The kid <br /> <br /> is also hit a lot, for those who think that watching violence against children is really entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is extra gore, but not in a wild style, like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue". Here, the gore is raw and never justified, it occurs. <br /> <br /> It's right in the budget. Most of the R score goes to Andreeff's <br /> colleagues, who are subjected to troublesome tape routines in the middle of the conversation scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire fangs! All vampires here must stab their prey to eat it. <br /> <br /> Great idea, unless you've already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin." <br /> <br /> Even after 77 minutes, and as soon as Ruben tries to follow <br /> <br /> artistic direction (asymmetrical frames, blurry scenes), he <br /> <br /> performs a tedious, boring and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for high physical violence, armed violence, sexual violence <br /> <br /> violent, bloody strong, blasphemy, female nudity, references <br /> <br /> > Sexuality, addiction and situations reserved for adults. <br /> <br />
