It was a terrible loss of time. No land. The acting was so far below par, it should be used as an example in the game classes of what NOT to do. It is simply a commercial scam of Universal Soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the barrel. It is unfortunate that VD needs to assert his ego every few years and even more regrettably that people are paying a lot of money to sit there. This kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name. In comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should take the Leslie Nielson title and make shipments of its kind. At least we could laugh with him instead of him.
