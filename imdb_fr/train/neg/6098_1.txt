Scotty (Grant Cramer, who was going to play in the big movie "Space Killer Klowns") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn to "dialogue" with the women of this bad comedy of the 80s. as in the jargon of the 80s, which meant good. Bad as in the bad. In the absence of sympathetic characters, including, but not limited to, a child who is the most bizarre type since "Friday 13th Part 2", a girl who leads men and then gets messy when they want the touch, and the big slob token, because after all, what would be a sexual comedy of the 80s without a big slob ?? Well, this one has two. This film is about the bottom of the barrel of sexual comedies of the 80s. And then came the continuation thus deepening said proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: too many to count, you even see the kid with the bizarre look imagined with breasts at a given moment, think "Bachlor Party "but not so funny, and VERY scary. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
