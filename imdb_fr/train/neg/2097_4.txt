I was expecting a lot better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel of the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for the end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, reprisals, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types, who make hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. Let me give you some helpful tips when viewing movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot titillation operator, then you know that the movie will be a failure. Caprica has a lot of that. The director / screenwriter usually tries to compensate for his weak abilities by throwing a few naked bodies. It never works and it only demeans the (very) young actresses involved and I pity them. The directors / writers who do this should be banned from the company. <br /> <br /> If you want to get bored for an hour and a half, rent Caprica. There is (free) porn on the Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go ahead, nothing to see here.
