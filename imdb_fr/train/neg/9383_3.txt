VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD the movie is a movie, other than that ... it's a movie that you can not afford not to watch .... I feel watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was interesting, but that kind of cliche .. ..bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but I think it could have been a little better if that was just not so cheesy, very poorly represented from idea to sieve, I think. The plot is sometimes somewhat predictable, even if the dance, I can say in time, is pretty good, the turn of the break dance was good ... IF you just shoot the film, watch the dance scenes and create your own own dialogue maybe it can be a 5 ... lol
