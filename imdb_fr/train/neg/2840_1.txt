Two old friends are sent to Japan to retrieve the results of a videotape containing genetic research, which was stolen by the black ninjas at the beginning of the film. First, they just need to learn some ninja skills because "only a ninja can beat the ninja". <br /> <br /> The killers of Sakura strive to be a nice ninja movie, but fail so badly. All the film is so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say anything good: the same scenario has been seen in different variants dozens of times before, the characters are drawn too briefly, the direction is bland and the scenario offers nothing surprising, even in the final scene, which in itself reduces the value of the film (trash). <br /> <br /> Even a ninja-flick fan of the 80s, who understands the aesthetic of trashy movies, has a hard time finding this movie just fine. It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, either visually or in the plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas swing, but it is not enough to direct the direction of the film that it is supposed to be and similar scenes of combat re-offend the most insensitive spectator after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Hard to recommend movie to anyone. Even the clumsy performance of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind the American ninjas of Sakura's killer. Even at the visual level, the film does not have a ball and it is a waste of time to try to find a fight scene in this film: there is none. In all, one of the most futile ninja movies I have ever seen. Do not even interest curiosity. Believe me on this one. <br /> <br /> Â½ out of 10.
