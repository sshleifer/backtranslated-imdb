Angela grew up and underwent therapy and surgery to make her a real-life girl, rather than her son, when she was born. She now holds a job as - wait for it - camp counselor! How appropriate, no? I know, I love it. Be that as it may, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise follows all the rules of the horror sequel: no more blood, no more imaginative murders (which are not imaginative, but even more so than the original), more nudity, a more elaborate plot, and more generally. worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining in the same way as the original, in that the characters and cabinets are so clumsy and so authentic 80s that you can not help but laugh. At one point, a guy asks Angela to go out and she says, "I'll call you," and then walks away quickly. The guy says to himself, "How is she going to call me, I do not have a phone!" and then he sniffs his armpits wondering what made him clueless (it's hair, man !!). <br /> <br /> It is a well-known fact that in obscure movies of the 80s, murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some sort of bad behavior, usually for being too promiscuous. When I started playing horror movies and saw the 13th movie for the first time in the mid-90s, I did not realize it. I learned it in a movie class a year or two later, and I was surprised to find that it was a method for madness. I was very impressed, not only by the fact that the films conveyed some kind of message, even morbid, but also that there was some thinking about it. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! Just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, "Let this be a lesson for you, say no to drugs!" Subtle real screen writing out there, guys. Here again, dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the film. Angela (who, by the way, has been following all this therapy and these operations and all the trouble of cleaning up her past and reinventing herself as a normal, well-developed person, then changed her name from Angela to, uh, Angela) , said at one point: "I do not like being the wicked witch of the West, but I know what happens when the situation gets out of control." (People start being killed ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then, later, she asks one of the counselors, Mare, to apologize, to which the girl answers: "I would rather die!" Sorry, Mare, but you really got into that one ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I was a camp counselor in a night camp similar to the one described in this movie (to the exception of the camp I taught to had more than three children out of the 15 or 20 counselors and there were also rules, which is not the case in the movie). This made me notice the myriad of inconsistencies in the film compared to life in the camp. <br /> <br /> That's okay, you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9-year-olds running around, although 10 or 11 year olds were killed in this movie. I had not seen that kind of thing before. <br /> <br /> An absolutely bad taste, even for an 80s slasher movie ...
