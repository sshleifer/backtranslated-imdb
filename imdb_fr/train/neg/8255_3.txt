At least, it's not full of insane violence or duvet. It's also not very loaded with thought or a smooth scenario. This story had potential but the director seems to have lost the site of the green. The story is disjointed and goes in strange directions, without conclusion. I also do not think the director spent a lot of time around a golf club. Some of the representations are absurd. Not very engaging.
