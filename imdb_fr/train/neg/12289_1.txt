I'm fed up with movies that seem funny in a line synopsis and end up being equal to what you would find in the bottom center of a compost pile. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" may seem interesting in a pitch for the studios, even with a "big name cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, nudge-nudge) and the Hildegard Knef's effervescent tastes (I do not know, a woman ...). <br /> <br /> But on film, it falls apart faster than a paper mache sculpture during a rainstorm. It looks like these unfortunate people are trapped in an island mansion off the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I guess) is the target of a satanic cult to have the child of the Hell, while others are offended in a grotesque and tortuous way. <br /> <br /> Okay, here you have a glimpse of the intrigues of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other low-quality films in the satanic series devoted to worshipers of worshipers amok line. None of this is very entertaining, and for the most part, you make your way from scene to scene until it's over. <br /> <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help a lot to count. They are only there to pick up a pay check and do not seem to want to give their "everything". <br /> <br /> At first glance, Hasselhoff would probably like to be back on the track with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; a PETA celebrity profit or a pro-am golf tour or whatever it is in today. <br /> <br /> And the scenes of torture! Ecchhhh. You will see the sewn people, clogged in roaring chimneys, hanging in trees during a violent storm, ships taking them out of their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought that "the mark of the devil" was the most sadistic movie I've seen .... <br /> <br /> Do not worry. It's not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. If you look at it, see if you can count the shots. And yes, Blair is possessed, as if you had not seen CELA down Main Street followed by a fanfare. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will make you itchy.
