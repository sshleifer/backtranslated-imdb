Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the tag "Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad movie that has unfortunately been hailed as one of the most deadly horror movies ever made. Horror movies should create such a fear people should shudder when thinking about a real horror movie. In Shining, there is no real horror, but what we find is rather a naive and stupid attempt to create a scary horror.Everyone knows how good these attempts are if they are different from reality All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were housed seems good too. A word about the actors, Jack Nicholson, looks like a lost and lazy soul who is never really sure what he's supposed to do. There's not much to say about a bald, colorful actor who , for the most part, is busy pampering a children's actor.No need to blame the bad weather for tragedy.It can not be avoided because the film was shot and poor Kubrick is not alive to perform Changes.
