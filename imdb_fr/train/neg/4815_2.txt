Like most comments, I saw this movie as The Witching, which is the title of the reissue. Apparently, the necromancy that corresponds to the original is better but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most wizard scenes still contain most scenes of necromancy and they are still bad. In many ways, I think that nudity added by magic has at least added some entertainment value! But make no mistake: there are only 3 scenes of nudity and it is a scene of varied people. No pompous evil is involved! <br /> <br /> This film is so horrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is awful and comes straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma has the tongue in her cheeks. It is the boredom with the personified right face. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the girl possessed in The Innocents, do you believe!), The most serious with its shrill and shrill voice. Welles just seems to be waiting for his pay check. The other main actress has a scary face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust him in the movie! And the doctor is very bad too. He also looks like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is unnecessarily filmed with scenes changing for no reason and the editing is unstable. This is because magic is a copy-and-paste job and not a subtle job. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also appalling and hard to hear with the new scary soundtrack that never closes. The "ghost" mother is also hogwash, but the actress is so hilarious in acting that at least she causes unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> In reality, this film (at least the witch) is reserved for the unwise. He can not have many sane fans because it's pretty unassailable and I found it really dull! <br /> <br /> The best thing is when the credits are gone - it's enough, better said, just better to this poor excuse for a film like the plague!
