I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is about the famous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It's not. It is a sober and earthly portrait of street life in New York during the hot summer period of 1977 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to Sam's son threatens. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there is Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are regularly boring and sometimes unbearable. Lee then tells their energy, their chaotic life, filled with anger, lust and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... Again and again, I wondered: where is the publisher of the film? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all this volume, the film misses any chance of transmitting any real sense of fear or fear resulting from the threat of Sam's son, who is too far behind. plan. Lee is better able to show a different type of threat, from neighborhood vigil groups. <br /> <br /> The acting game is consistently good. This, combined with 70's disco music and attention to costume and production design, really makes you feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> > <br /> The film's atmospheric authenticity, however, is not enough to offset a disjointed and exaggerated story about the lives of extremely irritating people.
