It could be the worst movie I have ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is not even close to its historical accuracy. It starts badly and then everything is downhill from there. Hitler's father curses his own bad luck on the "fact" that he married his niece! They were actually second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and raised in the role of his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and, as a child, she used to call Alois, "uncle". <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches where Hitler mocks his fellow soldiers and decides to take out his dog is simply a shame and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler hunt the dog through the trench, when he catches the poor, he starts to hit him for disobeying him. In the distance, we see and hear his comrades soldiers continue to mock and chastise this little cowardly man, then a shell falls directly on his persecutors and each last, we are told, is killed on the spot. How then, if Hitler was the only person who survived the scene, was this story of brutality and cowardice told? Did Hitler himself go "boasting" about this? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Hitler then intimidates and intimidates a poor, stressed and warlike Jewish officer by giving him an iron cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a pawnbroker before fighting for the homeland and had thought about bringing medals advertised in his store, because I am certain that the Iron Crosses are not distributed as shown in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> All the grotesque clich√©s are here, including the soothing and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "happy widow" was more likely to float the Fuhrer's boat than any "flying Dutchman" in Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler could have been responsible for the death of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for his appalling taste of music? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would be after several hours. <br /> <br /> Give him a miss.
