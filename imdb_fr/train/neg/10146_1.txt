'Flight Of Fury' is a shocking but terribly annoying action movie - I do not expect much from a Seagal movie, all I'm waiting for is a moderate fun for about 90 minutes with an insane action - unfortunately, this does not even realize this expectation. The action scenes are rare, the plot (which is absolutely irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, with huge holes through the plot. and her whispering performance An expression being the best among the sad fate of the 3rd evaluator - I can hardly believe that nearly $ 12 million was spent in this terrible disaster unless $ 11 million of this 12 is the salary from Seagal - I really doubt it! The only moment that interests straight guys or homosexual girls is the fact that, apparently, nowhere else, two hot girls end up in a lesbian sex scene with huge baps exposed aside from that. It's a mediocre thing that is no different from many of the Michael Dudikoff fiction films I've experienced <br /> <br /> 1/10
