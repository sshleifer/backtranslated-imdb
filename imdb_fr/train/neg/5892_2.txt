He clearly removes Hideu Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hideo Nakata's Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with notes of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but atrociously made gore (a green corpse with eyes red !?) weak story, and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a scary picture message). There were two moments in this film that made me shudder, both involving an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another of Miike Takashi, this one from 1999) made me tingle everywhere for hours after Having seen, and all the films that it steals In fact, it was scary, I do not see this film other than as a total sale to the Western popularity of the great Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
