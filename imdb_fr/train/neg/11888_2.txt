To make a film about the supposed end of the world, there must be facts and realism. 1. We are never told why these people believe that. 2.Location is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. PLEASE SOMEONE SAY WHY AGAIN WHICH WAS STILL BRIGHT AT MIDNIGHT AND WHY (according to the costumes) DOES IT APPEAR AS SEPTEMBER <br /> 3 /. The acting was in this neo-natural style, which required a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. the individual stories were all sad and aimless. I could go on, but I do not want it to be as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on the scale IMDB <br /> <br /> thank you I'm always like <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
