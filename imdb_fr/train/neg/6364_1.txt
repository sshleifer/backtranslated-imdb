Absolute waste, worse fight scenes than a van damme movie or a 20-year-old American ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> A really dramatic game, it's not a skill in sight in the whole movie, it's like a group of wooden sculptures. <BR/> <br /> Just watch how bad this movie was, it might have been ok in the '80s, but it's a 2006 film, I do not have a lot of love for this film because it was not born in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fighting movies, then take a look at tony jaa in ong bak and his protector. These are real martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Have fun and look at this today you can see the unintenional humor how dark it is.
