It was the worst movie I have ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act at all! she had no emotion it was blah blah blah as if she were reading a boring text book. The smart kid and the kid who likes food (their names were not worth remembering) were so boring that it drove me crazy. Daddy Mollys did not show enough emotion about his missing daughter. The policeman and dad Mollys said the same thing four times. it was just horrible. Everything was repeated much too much. Beatrice should have done something serious to him to be so mean. I just lost a moment of my life watching this movie!
