Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget that name in his life. This is the film that caused his fall. It was published with a lot of hype, but it crashed and resulted in heavy financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally pay them back for the losses incurred. Shortly after his publication, he tried to venture into politics but failed miserably. It's a very bad movie with a horrible acting, poor makeup and a pathetic scenario. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from an illness. I am one of the unhappy souls who saw Baba, first day, first show at the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before intermission. Sorry, I will not recommend this one to anyone.
