THIS REVIEW IS FOR MOST OF ALL SPOILERS. IF YOU PLAN TO ENJOY THIS FILM, DO NOT READ THIS ARTICLE. <br /> <br /> That's the problem with children's TV nowadays. Everything is so condescending and condescending. "Wow, that was fun, was not it?" No it was not. And unfortunately, it seems to have penetrated into children's movies. And that's what "The Reindeer Leak" is all about. Admittedly, I have not seen 'Flight of the Reindeer' for a few years, so I may be fuzzy on some points, but I remember not really impressed him at the time. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story follows a speaker who receives a book for Christmas. Now, the speaker is an esteemed scientist on the flight habits of some animals. I think they were bullfrogs. Anyway, thanks to this book, Mr. Lecturer / Family Man learns that reindeer can fly the same way as bullfrogs. Apparently, this book was written by a scientist several hundred years ago who disappeared at the North Pole. Now, if it were me, I would have thrown the book out the nearest window. The flying bullfrog is a natural phenomenon, but reindeer flying is a fantastic and totally unrealistic concept. But, Mr. Speaker, it's not me, so I guess that explains his decision to fly to the North Pole leaving his wife and child at home without knowing where he left. Of course, things go wrong and before he knows it, a flying reindeer crashed into his private plane and he's stuck at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Well. <br /> <br /> Of course, his family is devastated. I would be too, I mean, what a no-tacal Christmas. Elsewhere, the lecturer is in a hidden city of the North Pole, inhabited by dwarves and a tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Rather than trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, he welcomes everyone with open arms. This hidden civilization of the dwarf monsters, and he welcomes them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They tell him that they are the elves of Santa Claus and spend all year making toys for children they have no idea. And Mr. Speaker accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa Claus is actually the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago. There is just one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world can not know about their secret existence. After all, before they know it, there would be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every street corner. <br /> <br /> Always with me? <br /> <br /> Now, Mr. Gentile's family finds the book and assume he's gone to the North Pole. Boy, would not they be embarrassed if they found out he had just done a brisk walk? Before the spectators know it, they take off for a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, the speaker is fed up with all the poor dwarves and decides to leave. I do not remember exactly, but I remember holding Santa under the threat of a revolver. A battle of fire ensues when the dwarves attack and he manages to escape via Santa's sleigh. With Santa Claus on his heel and thirst for blood in his eyes, Mr. Whatever finds himself, through a wonderful coincidence, flying alongside the plane of his family looking for him. So he jumps on the plane, the plane comes back and everyone lives happy forever. <br /> <br /> The fact is that some shocking films have been shot in the name of Christmas over the years, but because they have this festive charm, they are getting away with it. And it is this charm that is totally devoid of "The Reindeer Flock" There is not much wrong with that; nothing that insults the intelligence (well, obviously, there is one, but it's a children's movie and can get by with such things) or anything particularly shocking, but the problem is that there is nothing good about it either. It does not scare me Christmas. And for a movie about Christmas, it's a major flaw. But, I do not think the mind of the target audience of 'Flight of the Reindeer' talks about that? Why should they? They are all so addicted to sedatives that they probably could not write "Christmas" <br /> <br /> I give him three out of ten. If it was a TV movie, I would add two more stars. We all know how bad they can be.
