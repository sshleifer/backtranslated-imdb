Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has his brain corroded by his work and memories of an abusive education of his stepfather, Barry (the real Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). It will sink into madness and eventually become a serial killer. The good (in the form of a homosexual man) and the evil (in the form of a bald and dumb guy) fight for the control of his soul. This film is defeated by bad humorous scenes and unintentional humorous scenes. That does not mean it's horrible or anything, but that you say it's also known that it's because of Bruce Campbell's fan base fan (of which I'm one) that will probably see some something in which he is involved or with which he is involved. <br /> <br /> My note: C- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Comment with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second commentary by Kallio and sound designer Joel Newport; "Hating every minute" a 17-minute documentary; deleted and extended scenes; alternate taps; shots, pictures of the world premiere; Poster and still gallery; Bios of talent; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Scenario in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: put the eyes in value for a small laugh (left eye) and a minute of nothing real easter egg (right eye)
