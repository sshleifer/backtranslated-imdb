My favorite part was when the credits started rolling. I wish I could give him one out of every 10 million. I really wish to have this hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or time on it. I really could have seen the grass grow and feel better after each fight. <br /> <br /> Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie did not destroy her. But she chose to participate. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was zero, more than any other film was zero. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That says something. <br /> <br /> Do not <br /> <br /> do it <br /> <br /> !!!!
