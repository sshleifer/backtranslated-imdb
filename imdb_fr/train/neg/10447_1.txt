I chose to watch this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But many people have either a really bad taste or someone has corrected the score. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a real disappointment. The film is exactly as stupid and far-fetched as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it was: it was like we were wondering, "Would not it be cool to make a film where there were snakes on a plane? reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff? And that's about it! The plot is slim and unoriginal.The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut the angles of a movie that no one , in his mind, will not recommend to anyone!) The acting is mediocre and all people are incredible stereo types. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen have never seen - stay away!
