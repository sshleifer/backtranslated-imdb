I can hardly find the words to express how bad this movie really is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and a stealth plane, which normally make up an entertaining action movie. In all honesty, I'd rather scratch my eyes with a cocktail stick than have to watch this movie again. The game was so horrible that it was almost funny. The story was incredibly weak, with holes of plot so wide that you could fly an F117 through. The script was so poor, if I discovered that a 10-year-old wrote it, I should not be surprised at all. The production and production are so amateurish that I would not even have hired these people to shoot the wedding video of my worst enemy. Absolute Absolute. The people responsible for making this film have depreciated the art and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never be in public again, I can not imagine what made him agree to play in this film, the worst film I've seen in my life.
