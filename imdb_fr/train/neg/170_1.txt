Viewers gushing out of everything, including the title sequence (now it's funny), would have us believe it's some kind of cinematic miracle, but, believe me, this is one of the most more embarrassing than you've ever seen, and if you 'If you do not make fun of it five minutes later, I'd say you've lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the role of a brazen and convicted RAF pilot who finds it appropriate to engage in an impressionable experience. (woman) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he is plunged into certain death and ardent. (Is not it romantic ...) Of course, he is spared by a metaphysical chance and washes himself on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller goes on a bicycle. (They drop off immediately). <br /> <br /> Looking beyond bizarre homo-erotic subtexts (so you have to refer to them as supertexts, a naked boy sitting naked in the sand) The theme of the film on his flute, inspired by the film Twilight, is addressed to a heavenly messenger if campy / queen (his makeup is more neat than that of the ladies), the strangest aspects of the film are the way he braids so bad caricatures. national and racial stereotypes in a complicated attempt to argue about the universal character and power of love. We understand - flying boys love girls in skirts and heels, and girls love them in return, and apparently all you have to do is cry a little bit to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Regarding the quality of the production, the continuity / editing is poor enough to cause a squeak, and the lighting is perhaps even worse, but you hardly the time to realize it because the script is so bad.

The staircase (which moves like an escalator) is actually not the simplest steps in Odessa, and I would really warn anyone to feel compelled to see this lame attempt to film on their behalf. All in all, the movie is bad enough to be funny, and it's the best thing I can say for that.
