Intrigue nonexistent, tons of misguided scenes / super-nerdy (world-class marksmen / shooters who can not even reach their targets a few feet away, and what's up?) Carnival shooting carnival? WTH ?), technical errors (how many balls can you insert into a glock magazine? 100+? These people shoot their weapons without the need to reload). The film is so bad that even the main Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can not save this junk. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I realized that I had lost 100 good minutes of precious life on this one). Hopefully the director will stop making movies or learn more for his next movie.
