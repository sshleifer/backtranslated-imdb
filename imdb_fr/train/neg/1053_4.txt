Weird take the tale of Cinderella. Terribly poor scenario, but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent stepmother performance. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. Vintage costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Advance quickly until you see something interesting and save 90 minutes of driving. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood to tell a story to Cinderella - I suggest "Always after: a story in Cinderella" The glass slipper ".
