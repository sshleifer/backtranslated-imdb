Shortly after watching this film, I wondered about the mental competence of each actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a laudable actress, why would she want to seize such an overestimated opportunity? I have to give credit when the credit is due, however. Some of the film's moments were unpredictable and rather pervasive, but they did not make up for the biting perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this film to anyone, man or woman, who respects himself.
