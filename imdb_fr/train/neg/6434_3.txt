I'm always surprised how different each person is and how in almost every movie you experience both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and those who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata would not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's up there. First of all, the sound. Producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on the editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking. Then, when Patrica spoke in a monotone voice, she was hard to hear. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but it was both flat in this film. Patrica basically had 3 emotions. Calm, very suffering or very angry, she has stigmata. The first was the one who predominated, the second involved screaming pains, the third raised his voice. It was the volume that distinguished the three, not the emotion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the deep meaning and the subplots that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible filming and style of MTV. When watching a 3-minute video, you need quick cuts and slow motion to tell a quick story. In a 2-hour feature film, it's nauseating. I do not see what she meant by seeing the women on the other side and dropping a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain so often! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story, with something to say, could have been intentional, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and the equipment needed to rain slowly Shots and rentals of this splendid apartment in which Mrs. Arquett lived, then they ended up firing the guy with the story.
