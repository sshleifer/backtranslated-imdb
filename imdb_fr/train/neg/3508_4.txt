Despite the devastating cult following this sad "documentary", I must admit that I hated the film that hit our party with a heartbreaking heartbreak, much more than useful information. That said, after seeing the beautiful music scene, we can appreciate what the film could have been in safer hands. <br /> <br /> One of the suspects is that many of us who have been actively involved in the film have been able to please all their fans of cruelty, destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or the ones we know - two or three steps away from the deplorable situation of the two crazy women portrayed living there and contributing to a misery they seem unable to control or flee. <br /> <br /> The film lets the viewer desperately wonder how a person could have slipped to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, provides no clue or cautious explanation, only a horror show no redeemed by humor or insight. <br /> <br /> This sparkling flatness of the film makes the realization of the scenic version (hopefully finally be filmed for the cable) more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion, but strangely, putting the detainees' sad fate to music, brings human tragedy to the art. More importantly, this law is preceded by a beautiful law I where we meet women before their decent becomes a mutually activated madness, and where they are offered clues about the creation of their isolated purgatory. In short, all that is missing in the film. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the filmmakers (or their successors), the excellent DVD Criterion disc includes sockets and bonuses that partly buy the main movie - behind the film Photos of scenes, interviews and comments - filling some of the blank areas that the original montage consciously decided to omit in its quest for unaltered horror and depression. They can not make the amateur film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more understandable. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's only the remarkable play inspired by composer-writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie, that draws the merits from above. a single (generous) star.
