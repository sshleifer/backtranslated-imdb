they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> Okay. At first, I doubted it, but after seeing the cloud wayward, I changed my mind and I finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons, with people dead or alive. no sex protected of course. the leader man (terribly ugly) pulls everything into the woman's mouth after he has made the woman dead. never heard of HIV? do not guess. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is mostly boring, but also incredibly revolting. In fact, in some cases, it was becoming so disgusting that I could not leave my virgin eyes. sex with the dead! it's disgusting and what's the message behind all this? we need water, we need melons, we have to be dead to have sex? sorry, but it stinks!
