The chillers begin with a cold, stormy night as a bus drops three passengers outside a bus station, a boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a university professor, Dr. Howard Conrow ( David Wohl) & a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discover that they have missed their correspondence and that they are stuck for the night. In the waiting room, they find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who is currently living a terrifying nightmare ... <br /> <br /> Whereas she swam in an indoor pool, Lindsay meets dudes and friends named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay sees Billy, he will dive into the pool and then disappear into the air before he surfaced. Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and tells her nightmare to others, everyone responds by saying that they too had troubling dreams & decided to share them to pass the time ... <br /> <br /> The next step is Mason, who tells how his two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are terrified during a camping trip ... <br /> <br /> Next, it is Sharon who tells the story of a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) with whom she calls in no time, Tom is in front of his door but he turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> It's then Ronnie's turn to describe how he discovers he can bring back the dead to the life. Unfortunately, he makes the mass murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) come back to homicide ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conrow tells how two of his students brought a former god of the Aztec war named Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then back to the bus station for a last (predictable) turn ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced & directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst Horror anthologies I have ever seen and I really like this sub-genre. Boyd's screenplay lacks what is needed for movies such as Chillers to work, you can see the final turn coming one kilometer and every story is really lame. The first is totally useless and does not seem to have an end. The best thing about these anthologies is the short catchy story that ends with an original twist. The second story is predictable and, again, ends without any profit. Thus, throughout the Chillers series, each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch and has no reward in return. The character and dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original idea and the film as a whole is totally nil. At least each story does not last long and the idea behind the link segments pleased me. <br /> <br /> The director Boyd obviously worked with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is that if you want to watch a new 15-minute run entirely in a pool, then Chillers is for you. The stories are neither intelligent nor frightening, nor tense nor constructed. That said, there are some beautiful scenes and a surprising skill sometimes transpires. There is not much violence in the Chillers, a heart torn, a head decapitated and a bitten hand is as bloody as it becomes. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Chillers are poor, which will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below-average production values. Chillers also offers one of the worst closing theme songs of all time, period. The acting is also very bad. <br /> <br /> I'm convinced that a lot of effort has gone into Chillers as a low-budget film and at least the filmmakers have tried, so I'm going to give it credit at least, but that does not do not think it's shit. Anthology similar to films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terror House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990) are far superior to coolers so be careful.
