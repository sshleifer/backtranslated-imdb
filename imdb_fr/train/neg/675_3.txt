A city girl, Meg Tilly, receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, naturally shaken, returns home to the rural digs of her family. She has to face a mystery: why do all the inhabitants of their home act in a strange and disturbing way? The radiological thriller, with barely a wink to ecology, puts the inhabitants of a small town in a state of berserk, which includes (in a ridiculous way) two women who look at each other with desire in a public place and that Tim Matheson receives the attention of a girl sitting on a desk. The photo is too stupid for words, wasting Tilly's nostalgia and quiet intensity in the trash while throwing herself into a corner where she can not hope to escape. Part of Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography is good (especially a fire sequence inside a garage), although it is disappointed by the disjointed editing - and a rather bathetic finale. The simplistic scenario has no surprise or originality. * 1/2 of ****
