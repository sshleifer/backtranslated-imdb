"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King wrote a screenplay. Given this, and the excellent song of Santo & Johnny that they used as the theme of the film, you would expect a strange and ultimately rewarding viewing experience. Unfortunately, that's not what you would get. The thing is, they probably could have made a good movie. The beginning is intriguing with the phantasmagorical atmosphere of this small town. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the film. The film becomes funny for no apparent reason! From this moment, the atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is completely ruined. For those of you who have seen it, you can forget the good old Johnny screaming "COP KABOB !!" after having planted the pencil in the ear of this cop?!? But do not get me wrong, humor has no quality. I just rented it again to see if mabye had cheated on me the first time, considering the originality of the plot, but I was right. Man, what a mess. I can not believe they got the rights to this song from Santo & Johnny. I gave him a 2.
