A DVD was released in the United Kingdom in 2002, code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the record, no IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> <br /> Probably a direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is no need to comment on an adult film. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are credible. It was broadcast in the United States in normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw it in Pensylvannia in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of films. The DVD does not have special functions or subtitles. It was probably created with a VHS tape as a source.
