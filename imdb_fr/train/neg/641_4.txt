To my knowledge, Largo winch was a famous Belgian comic (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without the life of a spy! So when I had to choose a movie for a 5 year old kid, I chose it because this kid was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But just after the opening credits, I have great doubts: when American movies offer an incredible start, here, no action and a hot sex scene ?? Then, the story becomes very complicated with financial movements? I thought I had lost the kid. <br /> <br /> But strangely, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? The story of the multiple box in which friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he is very interested in Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
