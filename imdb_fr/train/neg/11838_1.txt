If your idea of ​​entertainment is to look at graphic sequences of people crushed by cars (you can see a woman go under the front wheel, get bent when the car passes over it before going under the rear wheel - and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time), this is the documentary for you. Certainly, I did not look at this very disturbing voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for television networks to start showing slush movies. Maybe game shows based on self-mutilation would be good. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things are happening. I do not need to see the evidence on television posing as entertainment.
