This will be best known for the Ferrari that crashed when Eddie Griffin was promoting. <br /> <br /> The history of the race and the bets is poorly done by the numbers that seem to have a director who could not see Numbers. Widely a filming affair with a group of actors for a paycheck. It's not a good movie, but it's not serious enough to be watched and to end up as a movie that is not worth bothering, no matter how you look at it. In fact, one of the main roles is a woman, it is a film that was clearly designed to bring the producer and the director of pretty girls. Do you want evidence? There are long shots of women in almost nothing that is useless if it is perhaps to make those who are too afraid to rent a porn or DVD of the swimsuit illustrated Sports. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
