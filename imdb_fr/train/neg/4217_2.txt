It was recently part of AMC's animated movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that revolves around "Journey to the heart of the Earth" and "Mysterious Island". I was deeply disappointed not only by the credentials of the actor, but also by the stupid story that can be read in the cartoon of a five-year-old. Do not forget to see the threads holding the Pterdactyl's wings as they grab "Ogar", a semi-foolish pre-modern man who befriends lost adventurers. The end left the possibility to rehash the same effects in "The people that time has forgotten". Do not waste your time.
