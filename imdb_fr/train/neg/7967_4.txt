I may not be a big admirer of the original "Creepshow", but his trashy sequel makes the anthology look like perfection! And to say that I expected to love this one more. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero takes the path of EC Comic style and writes on this output the scenario of the three stories of Steve King. However, the management is entrusted to Michael Gornick. The film falters mainly in this aspect with uneven Gornick brushes. But most reproaches would come back to Romero's terribly static and insensibly grumpy scenario (especially in the dialogues that cross the first and last story). The moralistic messages (which came mainly from a group of sour characters) simply took over the black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said of the lively rotten score accompanying the photo. Vaguely linking the three tales (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) is a slightly curious and effective wrapping story in the form of nostalgic animation (80s). I rather liked this segment and the Creep wisecracking character was a glowing light. <br /> <br /> # In the first story, "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two elderly owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) of a general store located in a dying Aboriginal community, Dead River. To be stolen and possibly killed by a couple of punks who are dying to party in Hollywood. In front of the store, a wooden statue of an Indian chief comes to live to avenge their death. <br /> <br /> -Listen George Kennedy waffle .. And tell him 10 minutes about how he committed to his "big" community. What a beautiful, delicate and delicate moment. Well, like Kennedy's speeches, it's a monotonous, colorless and overdeveloped element that never has a good premise. The overbearing scenario is completely meaningless and performance is good. These two factors really added to my headache. When the Indian comes alive and becomes vengeful, the henchmen meet a very fast (though macabre) death in the proper way. The effects have been remarkably well done, but what about the free movement of hair? How could Hollywood knock out that lock of hair? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # Second story "The raft" follows a group of yahoo smokers and teenagers heading for an isolated lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they found themselves stuck on the platform because of a sinister creature hiding in the water. <br /> <br /> -Now it's much better, MUCH better. What begins when your teenagers run badly turns into a mysteriously scary installation that is full of narrow, claustrophobic tensions. And he can not even avoid bursts of nudity or malicious splatters. It's quite morbid and it's also good for his sense of humor. The surprisingly ironic ending has a nice touch to it. The performance of the parts are acceptable without leaving a huge mark. The management of Gornick sticks to the mean side and rather gooey. While the alarming music score on that occasion was relying on the right chords. The mud-like creature in the lake (as many have mentioned) looks like a thick black tarp (yeah, you're reading right!) Floating on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, the number three ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexually absent woman is on her way home after being with her male gigolo, but she is late. Thinking of some ideas to explain her delay if necessary, she skids and accidentally hits a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she leaves hoping to go home before her husband. Soon, she is terrified by the mutilated corpse of the dead hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> - Not terrible, but I did not really get into this ridiculously ridiculous exercise. Compared to the first two, this one had such a different tone and was trying to tickle the funny bone instead. Lois Chiles played the leading role in the leading role, but this constant assurance and the little conversations she has with herself have become terribly aggravating and fatigued. The effects of bright makeup are well displayed and dripping vision. When she hits the hitchhiker, it is at that moment that her execution becomes agitated, old-fashioned and delirious. From there, we constantly hear our hitchhiker supposed to repeat death and repeat ?? and repeat the line, "Thank you for the lady tour!" This happens every time she decides to overtake it. Have a little courtesy for the darling death. <br /> <br /> In total, the second new "The Radt" and its unpleasant and well-designed effects are what raises this extremely inferior sequel.
