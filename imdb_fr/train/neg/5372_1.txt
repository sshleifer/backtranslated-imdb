One wonders why this picture was made: the plot as such is totally incredible, if not ridiculous, the characters (lonely police officer experienced against young, quite fascinated) are quite predictable, the end is totally dark and impossible to understand but it would have to have a masochistic tendency, the idea being to read the book to understand what all of this is) and the acting is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that includes "Seven" and "Silence of the agns"? If it is, it is a total failure. It was a success though (and has some kind of cult status as the first French serial killer film) and, it seems, considered a good product to export. Strange.
