I saw about four other Japanese horror movies and they were not too impressive. However, I could feel that there was a reasonable scenario guiding the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. This is a detective trying to associate similar murders with those that occurred. When he finds a suspect to question, he panics because he continues to see a ghost. Then, the ghost begins to follow the detective for ONE REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND TAKES MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad? Oh no. The film keeps changing perspectives for different characters who do not have much to do with the story. I have seen this in other films where it shows a different perspective. That is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Moreover, everything that happens on the screen is really tolerable ends quickly. For example, there are some scenes with a slight instrumental score that accumulates and ... then it goes to another scene. I realize that this can be a dramatic effect. This is certainly not the intention here. It's just a bad montage. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "ghost" who simply screams in a way that is neither frightening nor funny. It's annoying and it happens often throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the frights have been done before in a more efficient way so that you can see them all coming. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that time, a wave of confusion swept over the audience, as I could feel that we all felt like we were wasting our time. Someone made a simulated applause and the laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. In other words, to avoid.
