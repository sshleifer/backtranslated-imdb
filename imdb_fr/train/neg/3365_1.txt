This mediocre remake of the 1963 classic begins reasonably well, then replaces the suspense with confused and useless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most frightening moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening with terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of his hand because it hurts him. Nell then looks at Theo, who is several meters away and realizes it was not Theo who was holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she plunges out and slides on the floor. It is only when she tells the invisible force to stop pulling it that we realize what has happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean - "It's family, it's always been family"? <br /> <br /> The centerpiece is Lili Taylor's performance, but even that can not save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that under her pretty exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however, needs to clarify this, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt one that should be recorded in the useless graveyard of remakes.
