This film offers nothing to anyone. This does not succeed at ANY level. The acting is awful, dribbling dull and drab. Obviously, at the end of the sex scene, they were trying to be shocking, but they ended up being a travesty of what the movie was looking for. Full of the trash, I can not believe what movie it was laughable. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure Rosario Dawson played in this movie, because she thought it would be her stunning movie, a breathtaking movie on the NC-17. The problem is that no adult will stay with this movie, which is played as an uninteresting episode of organized crime or something aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
