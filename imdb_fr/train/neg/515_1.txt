Oh man, this movie is bad. It runs horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chain of fast-food chicken and, in so doing, not to love each other. He tries to get out of the contract and makes horrible and painfully impossible gags. Jim Nabors seems to be as though he was sleepwalking without acting. You will miss Burt's henchmen like Dom Delight and Jerry Reed while watching this lousy. Loni Anderson's hair is downright scary, proving that tons of hairspray did not come out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. Speaking of, Burt's wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst movie on Reynolds' car, ever, with the title "Cannonball Run 2". The original films "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, fortunately, had no follow-up) are excellent, fun movies. This one is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You'll want a naughty Jackie Gleason like it's fun to hate. And, notice, this is not one of those fun movies. It's ugly, pure and simple. Even the exits at the end were tiring and boring, and worse, not funny. And the least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhat reviving years later in "Boogie Nights," another film that, like "Deliverance" several years ago, shows that man can play very good when he has a decent platform to do it.
