I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this film by a Southern Baptist Preacher when I was a child, and even then, I loved his horror. It is designed to scare the poor suckers so they are "saved". The only thing that "saved me" was the fact that it finally ended and I could go out and have a real life. <br /> <br /> Check out the chapter of this film in Sarah Diamond's book "The Right Christian Policy." FASCINANT. And certainly more interesting than the movie!
