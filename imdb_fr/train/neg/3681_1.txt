My God is this bad movie. I was totally misled by my local film critic because it is certifiable waste. Yeah, yeah, the good guys are wearing white, the bad guys are wearing black ... and the good guys are always winning. Now go home and hug your kids and find out how good Hollywood has been. Blech! I can not believe this dead brain movie was made by Wes Craven. I guess he needed some money to pay the mortgage, so he made that piece of dung. This is the kind of production that regularly makes those who watch movies look as good or better than an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> See you, a bad guy wants a pretty girl who loves her dad doing a bad thing or he's going to hurt his dad. But being Ms. All American's next daughter, we know she's going to save the day and defeat the bad guys ... the end. Girl power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Come on, now, only an idiot could find that entertaining ... "a roller coaster ride", not to mention something new or new. All the "super-duper" reviews that you see on this site come from industry pirates who are making money with this movie, paying a favor, or selling their soul to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... yeah, that's all. Not a good performance, not a horrible one ... she's just cute. She should have shown a lot of skin to save this movie. She is not strong enough to be a good female action track. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was passable at least 28 days. But here he's playing a naughty idiot pretending to be clever. He gets kicked by the McAdams 5'5 '', because after all, she was a cheerleader ... and a hockey player ... and I'm sure she has all the tapes of Tae Bo ... So, she should be able to send an international terrorist to rent. I would not trust him to steal a pack of chewing gum from 7 to 11 years old. <br /> <br /> You see, this movie was done before, except before they did it well. Re-rent one of Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, with the exception of the characters who are more friendly and credible and the bad guys who are much more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can go on doing such bullshit, as if it were unaware of the proper patterns that it can easily copy. No surprise, movie revenues are down. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 in the bathroom and save 2 hours of your life that you will never find. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
