You have to like cheap, budget movies. This one comes with bad effects, accessories and a bad action (really bad). Plus, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister), I keep thinking, "Watch out! She is a vamp! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone in bad taste wants to waste money making a movie, the little spent of course. I do not know if I am sorry for the author of the film or for the producer who did not bring back money. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is good for the little children in his simplicity, but I do not know if I would like to submit a child ... <br /> <br /> uh ... 1/10 because it's the lowest.
