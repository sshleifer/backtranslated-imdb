Last night, I came here to make a review before choosing the TV movie to choose from, and the ones I found made it look irreplaceable. How I feel misled! <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be noted in advance that this is a housewife movie. The representations are wooden, each sentence is an attempt to "poignant" as are always the housewife's movies and bad serials, and it is based on the well-known and well-established premise that men (especially the soldiers) are essentially violent and unconditional. The entire film speaks of the apparent "drama" in times when male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this seems tolerable (or even pleasant), then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, though pretty good, distracts painfully - just like her face, for whatever reason. The other representations are undoubtedly a permanent source of embarrassment for their authors, with painfully lean and obvious characterizations on the agenda. There are few surprises, but expect the infinite amount of food and drinks "Monty Pythonesque" that miraculously appear in the backpacks of hungry soldiers! beautiful or texture or emotionally charged. What I had was a well-felt and particularly painful Christmas story that will appeal to an intelligent audience. That's what he has to say. <br /> <br /> Look at her in the following circumstances: 1: Nothing else. 2: You are a fan of the predictable housewife who "takes men and wins TV movies". 3: The only way you can enjoy a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have drunk enough so that your emotions are easily moved by unsophisticated stories.
