I was expecting a lot of this indie after reading the many reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are my "two cents" extra compared to the excellent review "lost in the translation" already published. Premise: Morgan is "stuck" in a small dusty town where he meets the pretty Scarlet who works in a local supermarket. Can Morgan help bring the beautiful Scarlet out of her trash life? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? DO NOT. How about this shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks inside the target as if he were entering Harrods. Then he went past a t-shirt, confirming that he was NEVER in any shop visited by the pretty Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any aspect of Scarlet's reality and is described as joyful in her ignorance of everything and anything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> A reviewer appreciated the fight scene between Scarlet and her ex-husband where her survival, In this case, a car demands that she physically attack her ex-hubbie. Freeman runs for his defense ... naw ... he curls up in disbelief and is totally unable to cope with such a brutal aspect of his real and desolate situation in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character thinks a car wash and a new revealing and tailored blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless "stage talk" in which all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or more other experiences related to Freeman was irritating. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right to point out that Scarlet is young with her future in front of her and that she then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces: no education, no skills and no white-collar experience, VERY POOR, without family support and a life of low self esteem. Scarlet learns life lessons from Freeman, for example: some people pay $ 100 for a t-shirt and a revealing blouse can open the doors instead of lack of education and professional white-collar skills. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet a little more than a strange "star" distraction, not even paying for the essence of Scarlet, which makes her life immutable in a city whose name is unfamiliar to her.
