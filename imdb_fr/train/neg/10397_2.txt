Just not the quality I was expecting from Morris (I love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It looks a lot like a not so bad student movie. What concerns me in all of this is why did he win a BAFTA ??? Morris laughs at the "entrenched mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) and yet, with this piece, he urinates on the back of the talents and tells us that it's raining! <br /> <br /> I only hope that he chooses a topic that I would like to discuss (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions), he will not put himself in this position, spoiling the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of ignorance and general opinion about this emotional and strongly turned phenomenon.
