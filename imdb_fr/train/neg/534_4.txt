This shit is like watching the paint dry. I am so disappointed because I was so impatient to see him. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not make sense. If this was never done, no one would notice or care. He's excited because of all the big names in it, but if there was no one, no one would want to give this movie any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the mid-point of the movie I was watching Vanessa Redgrave and thought, "Hurry up and die already!" It's like the "Joy Luck Club" without the slightest joy. This is the film "Ocean's 13" (a cast that has many names) of mother-daughter films and totally anti-climatic ... until it is finally over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they'll all be nominated for the Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses engage in this junk.
