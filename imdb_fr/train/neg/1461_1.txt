I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he did not hit people with his fist, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: it's too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was smarter, than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as a leader because he can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler did not show his evil side to the people. <br /> <br /> Did any of you, Yankees, watch the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? It's a very good movie, with incredible actors. And it's a German film. I think this theme of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film by people who know nothing about Germany. People! Look at "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie about a very sad time for people humans around the world.
