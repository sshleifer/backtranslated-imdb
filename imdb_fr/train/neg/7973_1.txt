I go to a lot of movies, I often bring my 5 year old son, I'm so glad I did not bring him to this one. There are a lot of references to sex and a skinny dive scene, however, that's not the main reason I would not bring it there. Trailers make you think it's a light comedy. nevertheless, almost all the fun moments are in the glimpses. I kept waiting until it became interesting, funny or anything but serious; However, I almost fell asleep while the story without intrigue was prolonged. I understand that dogs can be a great company. That said, the whole story focused on a dog with mediocre behavior that the owners were not savvy enough to be trained. If a human being caused so much damage and chaos, that person would be banned. The worst movie I have ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of their talent. The best way to summarize this film is, couple become unruly dog, couple falls in love with dog, dog dies, sad couple. The end.
