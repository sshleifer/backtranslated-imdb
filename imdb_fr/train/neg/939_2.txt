I loved the Batman TV series and I was really looking forward to seeing that. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> I did not understand why Adam West and Burt Ward had tried to recover the batmobile. I do not want to hit Burt or Adam for their current appearance ... It's been 35 years since they appeared to Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in suits and fighting with "badguys" was a bit sad. I would rather just see the ex-stars comment. The story of batmobile was stupid. <br /> <br /> Regarding the flashback movie, I think it was too short and too much left out. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed the penguin and the joker for about a minute each to tell the same things I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated him and was a former smoker. That was it on those 2. <br /> <br /> I would like to read the book. I'm sure he has more than it showed. Like why there were 2 Riddlers or 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes. Where were Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc.? As I said, even those who were in this one were barely there. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really cheesy.
