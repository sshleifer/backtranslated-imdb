Horrible, just horrible. This proves my theory about "star power". It's supposed to be a good TV because the guy who made (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. B O R I G <br /> <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting - for example, watch your TV without picture or sound. 1/10 (I judged it so high because there are no negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory "star power" is: the more the "star power" is used in a show, the lower the show. (This is called indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" gives a better quality, etc. Another way of looking at things is: "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
