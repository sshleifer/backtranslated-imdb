Basically, I went through the movie, but it was enough to catch the plot. To tell you the truth, it bothered me a bit and in some places it made no sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He was so hot, but in this movie, his hair was pretty weird. But still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite the heat of CHACE, the film was not compensated. I guess the plot is not so bad, but what really throws me on the head is the fact that they argue like every sentence. Is it so difficult to express your anger without saying the word "F" every time? Cusser was boring and anything that upset the camera was shaking my head. <br /> <br /> In all, even if the plot was OK I found the film boring and dramatic. That's why I only cut scenes with CHACE. LOL In any case, you do not have to be rented unless you're an unconditional fan of a specific cast member like me. Oh yes, the cast was hot. The girls were hot !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
