Why why! ... did I pick up this one? Well ... I needed some evidence in the heat of the summer and the blanket looked cool. <br /> <br /> Of course, I should have known better. It's a very, very bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when manufacturers know it's bad, and try to hide it by adding sexy / beautiful women and sex scenes. Well, guys ... it does not cut, it does! <br /> <br /> If you WANT a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good, well played and fun: go rent Lake Placid! (It's an order)
