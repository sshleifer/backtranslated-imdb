Let me start by saying how much I like the television series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing and manipulative father, he was incredibly light and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly one of the largest British sitcoms of all time. The popularity rating of my TV series is 10 out of 10. Unqualified. <br /> <br /> This film, however, is a tragedy in every sense of the word. Most of the TV show is hardly transferred to film. This film has a very sad and depressing tone that almost moved me to tears several times. Seeing Harold being beaten in a pub (and not comically) is not my idea of ​​comedy but it's certainly one of the reasons why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The film was painfully funny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely devoid of sound and I wonder if the producers of this film has ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the television series, Harold has always looked for respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's friends were absolutely invaluable in the television series. In the film, Albert says practically nothing when such an opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> Most of the spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be rather boring, with the exception of ON THE BUSES movies (which respects were actually better than the TV series itself! ). But STEPTOE AND SON must rank at the bottom of the stack, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this one and watch the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much clearer tone, is more faithful to the TV series and is actually very entertaining.
