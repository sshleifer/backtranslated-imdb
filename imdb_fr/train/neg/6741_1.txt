Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will be sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It does not mean anything !!!! And I do not even speak of the voluntary suspension of unbelief, which has no meaning. Why does her family live in England? Or, at the very least, why does not she have a British accent? She is comfortable with her father and he surprisingly forgives him for not being there for two years. (In this regard, no one has ever made much of the fact that she has been away so long). And what was there with crazy outfits at the bachelor party? I will not even get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her - it could have been overcome by a better movie. I'm just saying that the characters, the scenery and the plot are not detailed enough to create a story that is still a bit coherent. Oh, and the worst, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's systematic use of the less flattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose - I would have sued the filmmakers if I were her! Honestly, I totally agree that women are what they are, but why in seven years of fidelity to Will and Grace, did I ever notice how incredibly strange her nose was? Oh! Because these producers are nice to her! This film, like my other least favorite film, Armageddon, is the fault of filmmakers, not actors. I can see Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better screenwriter, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily makes my vote one of the worst movies I lost time on. I'm just happy that a friend lent me his DVD, so all I've lost is time. If there was a way to do this zero star review, I would do it.
