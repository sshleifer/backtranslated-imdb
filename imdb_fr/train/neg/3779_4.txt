Even if an animated film bored at least 6 people. <br /> <br /> As an adult growing up in a region populated by wild horses and Americans, it was a mix of PCs and too many fantastic movies created by people who did not have never lived in the area where they filmed. Speak to those who have lived on horseback, most treat their animals as members of the family, regardless of their origin. Regardless of the context, we have been dealing with good and bad wild horse breeders. I had to explain that it was a real life problem for us vis-Ã -vis the visions of filmmakers to children who were surprised to see how PC displayed a world different from what they actually knew. <br /> <br /> The normal Disney or Dreamworks rate of cute talking animals that burned the screen was nice from the viewer's point of view. But if you live in an area similar to the one shown, you may be able to answer questions.
