this movie was terrible. I thought that with all the decent actors, it would be better. Do not waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was horrible. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming an actor B. the mess he made in the movie, I could never be your wife was the embodiment of what I say. and Lake Bell, she was cute but certainly needed more drama lessons. Look like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a little better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful that you have not lost your precious time. PS I love you is also a good beyond the romantic grave! It's time to watch more than 7 out of 10 movies and listen to people who have already seen it.
