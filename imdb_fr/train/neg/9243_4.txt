To put it simply, I do not like westerns. And since I was never seated from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and watch it all the way, even though it was painful for me. At first, it was atrocious as expected. I found the actor's act laughable, the landscape (your usual dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its staggering timing at the edge of the painful. However, after having the courage to struggle mentally, after the first 20 minutes, it started to be a little easier for me. Focusing on cinematography, and on how John Ford managed to make even the most boring (boring in my opinion) situations, they sometimes seemed amazing, which made them much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I enjoyed the film in the end. However, it has been done well enough that I sit to the end, and that in itself impresses me.
