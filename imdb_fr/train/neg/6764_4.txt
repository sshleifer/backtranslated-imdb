KILL NATURAL KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Film cut: R <br /> <br /> Cutting director: NC-17 <br /> <br /> The image of Oliver Stone is unusual . read that he was drugged during filming, I needed no further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, insane film that we do not get often; strange, psychotic and artistic images. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" basically describes how two great killers were popularized and glorified by the media; There is a good scene where an interviewer interviews teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "The murder was wrong ... but if I were a mass murderer, I would be Mickey and Mallory". Mickey describes this as a situation of "Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Frankenstein is the medium that has turned them into monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films examine the flaws of America, the country the director loves and admires. I guess "Natural Born Killers" deals with the effect of mass media, technology and the obsession of our nation, Americans are (and most of the world) for events such as mass murderers and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The assassins played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed in a surprising way by two excellent actors who launch into the lives of two murderers of an interesting brutality. Mickey and Mallory think that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest). Mickey says in his interview in prison that other species commit murder. We, as human beings, are devastating other species and exploiting the environment; The scenario is interesting, but one may wonder how this film represents a reflection on society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of a two-hour bloodbath that we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of life in prison; the attitude of the director, etc., the overcrowding of prisons - perhaps Stone is questioning the future, the path taken by society. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a journalist who runs a show on "The Maniacs of America" ​​and is obsessed with improving ratings, bends over backwards to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is the policeman Scagnetti, a mad officer, perhaps sadistic, in love with Mallory. He also has a strange obsession with mass murderers, since his mother was killed during the Waco Massacre in Texas by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is superb; different colors, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the most obvious green color is green, to resemble the killer's disease (in the pharmacy when seeking an antidote for the rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is insane; fragile, dynamic, it takes determination to get used to it and accept it. Very unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" does not glorify the existence of senseless killers, he questions it and how we, as an audience, can nurture this attribute ... <br /> <Although the above review seems pretty positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, is not happy with the changed script and is asking for his name to be deleted. I can see why. Naturally interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
