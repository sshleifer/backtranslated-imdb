My first question after seeing this movie was: "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the point of view of the boy, it did not go well. Of course, there was the stereotyped use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside his field of vision. Having a main character unable to speak (which obviously suggests a child's dumb and impotent position) makes it difficult to deepen this character. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "a literary or other work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflicts", the LIAM corresponds to this definition to a T. and well-nourished priest who draws money from parishioners. (A stereotype that becomes very tiring.) Moreover, the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who did not think we would see Theresa rubbing the toilet after her mother said, "None of my daughters will rub the toilet? another woman!" I'm a fan of British realism if everything goes well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
