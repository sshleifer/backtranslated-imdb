I hated this movie so much that I remember it very well. It's not even funny. Any movie that relies on senseless sexual jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it happen. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. All I could think of was "he deserves it for making such a bad movie". Do not waste your time and money with this one.
