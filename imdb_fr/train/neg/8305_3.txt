Like most people, I like "A Christmas story". I had never heard of this film and maybe for a good reason: it's awful. Same place, same narrator, same director but the warm blur of the original was lacking. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone replacing him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story", Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun seems cute, but his obsession with this film is boring. Scud Farkus, the neighborhood's original bully, is replaced in this film by another child with suspenders and a strange hat, but with little threatening appeal from Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to match the original, even if this film had been shot with the original crew.
