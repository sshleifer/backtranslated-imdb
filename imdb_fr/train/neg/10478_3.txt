I sincerely consider this film as another poor effort of the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a bit funny, but when they change roles in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men usually do), the film falls. Become boring and not funny at all. They left a lot of things without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way as a Roberto Angel played his character and his little one either. I went to the cinema hoping to see a good job, but I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
