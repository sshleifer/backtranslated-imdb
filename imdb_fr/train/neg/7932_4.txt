Oh my God, what a disappointment. I've been watching old Westerns on British television for decades and I was not aware of it until it aired yesterday. Most other Westerners arrive after a few years and are usually worthy of rebroadcasting. The rich color and exterior decorations were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Many times, I wanted to turn it off and finally, halfway through, something I rarely do, it's over. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed strangely bold in the girls' charm, his two acolytes were annoying, as was the Mexican boy bandit. And I have the feeling that the uniforms of the army are at least 20 years old, even though it has upset the manufacturers of many other Westerners. <br /> <br /> Maybe the situation improved in the second half, but I could not be bothered to wait and see.
