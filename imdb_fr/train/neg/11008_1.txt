I bought this record from Tower Records after seeing the info-market about fifteen hundred times on Comedy Central. I was really looking forward to watching this. My God, where am I wrong? Now, before giving my opinion, let me just say that I am a person who can find good in all movies, God, I have more than 1,500 DVDs! That said, the underground comedy film ranks among the worst films I have ever seen. I tried to give him a chance, but it was not just funny. It made no sense, did not offend anything and was totally stupid. God who in their minds thought these pieces of shit were funny? it goes to the bottom of the trash ...
