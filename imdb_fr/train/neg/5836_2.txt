From the pen of Richard Condon (the Canadian Manchu candidate of 1962) comes this confused narrative of political intrigues and assassinations. The story, told almost like a comic book, is hard to swallow. If the casting was the best star, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and the team: the novel was filled with the same gaps. It seems that sometimes, the story actually makes fun of the more sincere efforts made in "Manchurian Candidate". A disappointment on all levels.
