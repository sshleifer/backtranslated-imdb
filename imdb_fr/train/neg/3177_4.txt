I must admit that Over Her Dead Body was not as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I was just thinking of going ahead and seeing the horror in front of my eyes, but in reality it was not so bad. I was just expecting this awful film, but it seems that the writers did not mean anything wrong, but the cast of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), she seems a little behind for the film. I think maybe I thought it was a little better without her, but she annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie pretty cool. But you have to admit that this movie does not make sense, it's one of those quick pay for the kind of actor. The movie could have been funnier if someone had really paid attention and had a better cast. <br /> <br /> Henry has lost his future wife, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister brings him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate haunts her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to go so fast and she'll make sure Ashley does not compromise him by torturing her day and night with her hikes, trust me, with Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Over Her Dead Body is an exciting movie, I do not know if it's worth it, but I'll rent you a rental if you want to see it or if you're curious. Eva Longoria simply does not have enough power to run the film, without wanting to offend those who love it, she belongs to the small screen on the big screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she still does not seem too nice with everything she pulls, or his friend "gay", Dan, again, not really friendly. With just a few rewrites and proper attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get the predictable romantic comedy that will leave a feeling of emptiness. <br /> <br /> 4/10
