It must be one of the worst movies of the 1990s. When my friends and I watched this movie (being the intended audience), we sat down and watched the first half hour, our jaws touching the ground, to how bad he really was. The rest of the time, everyone in the theater was just starting to talk to each other, leaving or screaming in their popcorn that they were actually paying the money they had earned to watch that weak excuse for a movie. It must have sounded like a great idea on paper, but on film, it seems like no one in the movie has an idea of ​​what's going on. Shit acting, shit suits. I can not understand how embarrassing it is to watch. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
