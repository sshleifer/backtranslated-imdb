(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely awful movie. First of all, he has this average guy. I guess he did his career playing super darling fathers. It was the first time he tried to frighten his son by pretending to be a monster ... but 10 minutes later, they did it again! And so on, this movie moves in real time unsustainable. At one point, I began to imagine that it was a few days later, until I was reminded that the plot was only the next day ... again in the early afternoon! I do not really know who this couple is supposed to be in real life. First, they are portrayed as a kind of Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These guys stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today, they lead Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they still did not fly the Volvo. <br /> <br /> Okay, so there is Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small magical statue of Wendigo and explains his powerful magic. Come on ... are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries? Just to take her home, they sweep each Indian statue in their tourist trap north of New York City. Native Americans are described in a way that has not been seen in this movie for decades! Oh, and about Wendigo. It is not really the cause of horror. He does not kill the father of the child, which is the most horrible thing in the film ... he has just been killed by an ordinary bad guy with a grudge and a high-powered rifle. The Wendigo only comes late in the movie to avenge the guy who killed the father ... oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was a little angry at the father, maybe because he killed a stag ... so Wendigo must have been happy that the father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so on ... insulting, boring and insane. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
