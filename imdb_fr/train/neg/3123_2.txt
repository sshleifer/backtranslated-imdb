I felt that mine was watching this ... but it seems that this is the reason for the madness that reigns in the family in this movie. It does not make much sense anyway, as others have already mentioned, it was one of the last films of Karloff and only its presence on the screen gives it all its credibility. It is unfortunate that all the great legends of the horror movies of the era of sound have finally been reduced to playing in garbage like this. At the limit, Boris did better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and recognizes the merit of trying to keep this mess in unison. Strident background music does not help or distract moments of lucidity. Aside from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is dubbed in a strange, cut-out English monotone reminiscent of the one used in pornographic movies of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's "Usher's House", but you'd be hard-pressed to find a lot of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> However, there are much better films with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and give them a large place, unless you also want the curse of the "shrinking brain" !
