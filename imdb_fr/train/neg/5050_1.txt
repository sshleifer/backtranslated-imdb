Oh dear, it was the worst reunion movie I have ever seen. (That says a lot.) I am ashamed to look. <br /> <br /> What happened during the script meetings? "Ooooooh, I know, let two stud muffins fall madly in love with the most annoying character ever - since Cousin-Oliver." "Yeah, it'll be cool!" <br /> <br /> Even for sitcoms, it was the most unlikely plot ever since Ron Popeil started painting bald men with pistols.
