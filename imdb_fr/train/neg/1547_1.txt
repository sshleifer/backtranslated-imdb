I could name a lot of fun movies. There are funny comedies that are funny. Some movies, like a Gymkata for example, try to be serious but end up being fun. The Ladies Man is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but it could not be less if it was a guy who had many girls in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust . It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think I laugh so much as laughing at anything in this movie. It's just not funny. It's boring, stupid, silly, boring, bewildering, but not funny. I do not really care about Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I was expecting better than that. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense. It's as if the writer had a bag on his head while he was typing and he could not see what keys he was hitting. They tell the "origin" of the women's man, but fail to motivate his bizarre fascination to act as if it were still the seventies. The film tries to draw humor from a man who seems to be having fun in porn, shortly after trying to hang himself. It's comedy? I like to think of myself as having a pretty keen sense of humor (spending a lot of time writing comedy like I do), but I may not be brilliant enough for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, so funny that Tucker in There's something about Mary, is shockingly bad here. I pleaded with him in my head to keep quiet. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hammered my chair, grumbling, and if the film had lasted longer, I probably would have tried to kill myself. This film may not be as serious as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first film I'm seeing that is getting closer. <br /> <br />
