Ronald Colman won an Oscar for Best Actor for his brilliant performance as a popular theater theatrical who is completely lost in his roles, notably in Shakespeare's Othello. Critically praised George Cukor's film has a wonderful pedigree, written by the esteemed team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty jokes are awkward here and the behind the scenes business is too ripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for her score and Shelley Winters has some good times like a tough waitress (when Colman speaks to her breathlessly, she asks him: "What are you?" A kind of crazy? "). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly slippery and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
