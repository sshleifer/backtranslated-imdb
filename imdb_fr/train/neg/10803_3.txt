OK, so after watching this invigorating film and lost an hour and so many minutes of my life, here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom box, gives this hairy kid 3 wishes, the kid wastes his wishes on I forget what, shaq fears rap, and I guess that's it. <br /> <br /> It was mostly me who laughed, I cried ...... but I mostly laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful talents of actor Player / rapper nba and boy with hairy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to college kids who drink beer with their close friends and who seriously need to laugh. <br /> <I'll give it a 3 out of 10 just because the movie is based on 3 magic wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, one would be to erase this horrible film and for everyone to claim that Hollywood did not waste money to do it.
