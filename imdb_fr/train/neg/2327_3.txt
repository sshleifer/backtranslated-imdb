This film comes straight from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90s by producing terribly bad and nerdy horror movies. The most famous disasters of their work are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and Dr. Mordrid is not, either. The hyperactive director Charles Band came in good company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly stupid and nerdy and almost humorless. I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that this can have several disadvantages if you are a fan of it. For every good film, he seems to have made 5 inferior films. Anyway, the story is about the battle between two ancient wizards. A good who has been here for 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and a villain called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for a reason that I had already forgotten. Combs gets his instructions from the mentor. This "guy" only exists with a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that's it! From time to time, a blinding light appears on the screen, but it's pretty much the only special effects form of this movie. All this is just a bit of complaint and harassment. When the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it ... I would expect the evil wizard to defend himself at least a little, but nooooooo .. .. In some scenes, you can really detect some originality and creativity (as, for example, Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals) and, if you pay attention, you could even find very small but enjoyable aspects (like the Raven). Edgar Allen), but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and he may be a superhero to me ... but he does not have to put on a stupid jersey for that.
