Sensational. That's about all I can say for the moment. Who writes this thing? Who produces this stuff? Which self-respecting actor would agree to act in these kinds of things? Oh my God! I do not know how I managed to get through this movie, but I guess the fact that I had drunk about eight cups of coffee that day was the key to keeping me awake. Lord! It's one of the most sordid and predictable cinematic scenes I've ever seen ... and for the record, I NEVER plan to "see" it again. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like it. She is cool. I will watch it as soon as I get home (error # 2). I tried to watch her without moaning every five minutes, wondering when that shit story would end, that's what I did. But I failed. It was one of the worst things I have ever seen. I mean ... what's with this thing where he imagines what would happen and then come back in real life? It was pretty boring when the father did it in 'Parenthood' as it was ten years ago. The "jokes" - and believe me, it takes me a lot to call them that - are stupid, the characters are banal and forgettable, the scenario is quite predictable ... all this gives a film that should be wiped HISTORY RECORDS ! I should have told myself that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. It was probably a DVD directly. <br /> <br /> For all those who are considering watching this, I have a tip. DO NOT! For God's sake ... do not do it !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, and I mean nobody wants to buy it! And I'm talking about second-hand and second-hand thrift stores that buy the mud from your shoes and stick it in the window. This should let you know how bad it is.
