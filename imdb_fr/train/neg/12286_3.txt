The summary provided by my cable TV guide made the sound much more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I have ever seen, a title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From the opening scene, I could say it was going to be really bad, but I was so bored that I did not care. This film contains laughable actors, especially from the tormented guy in his dreams, incredible as in the twists and turns of the credible plot, and the most rotten music I've heard, Nsync dominates the airwaves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. A film so dull and boring, and so not scary, because it would try to spice things up with some weird one-liners here and there, but no. We have an egocentric friend of the tormented guy trying to be funny, but that seemed boring. (spoiler) And please, tell me who in this crazy world is crazy enough and disgusting enough to visit a frightening prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you want to make a horror movie, make it at least believable. This one is anything but.
