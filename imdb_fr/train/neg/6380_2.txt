Well, what can I say about this movie? I am speechless. I could go on saying how stupid this movie is forever, but the only thing that REALLY discarded me was music. And to top it off, someone commented on how much they loved him. For them all I have to say is that he was snatched from one of the best martial arts movies of all time, Fistsof Fury with Bruce Lee. If he were still alive and he never came across this film, he would be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a loss of duct tape. I say tape because a movie like this could not have been shot. I feel stupid now to lose 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only reason I even saw this was that my roommate had downloaded it out of morbid curiosity. What is this world coming from?
