<br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror / science fiction movies, whatever the budget, but after watching countless horror movies late at night on cable and video, this movie must be the worst of all. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered with fake blood or ketchup that continued to be shown over and over again) and people running everywhere shouting from left to right then back to right It should have stayed with the convenience store scene beginning and stopped there for 15 minutes. Instead, he is dragged for a very long time. It's very, very small budget x5. Many scenes were way too long. The narrator looked very amateurish, as if a random person from high school was talking. This is the only movie to have a lower rating in my opinion in Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. Megalon despite higher budgets. 10 repeated repetitions, try to stay awake throughout the movie, or better yet, avoid it as if you were a brain-eating crowd of undead. Why did-never-never-seen-that-piece-of-zombies-dung-blues. Incarnation of bad nauseating films, etc. to infinity. -infinity / 10
