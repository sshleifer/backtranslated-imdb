First of all, I had doubts when I looked at the DVD box and read it saying it was a group of teenagers gathered around a lake where they would find something. All films whose principle is such that it failed miserably, even as a slasher film, with the exception of the first Friday, December 13. I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I kept thinking that it had to go a little better. It does not have. I usually think that every film has something you can draw from it. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself some pieces of paper or eat some dirt.
