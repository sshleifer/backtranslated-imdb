Oh my God, what happened here? !! I will not repeat it, but what kind of movie back is this? The dubbing in this movie is worse than the one in "King Kong vs. Godzilla", Linda Miller was to be the worst actress and the costumes are really ridiculous. He's talking about a villain called Dr.Who, who gets henchmen to build a robot A gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down, he builds another, then tries to kidnap Kong. Then Dr.Who sends the robot to his suite. <br /> <br /> Later, as I watched the movie, Linda Miller and the other clowns began to moan. I did not see the DVD well. While he was playing, I was hoping that the madness in the movie would end until the fight. The end must be really bad because they could have shown Kong again on his island fighting dinosaurs. <br /> Do not watch the film under any pretext or if you do it ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
