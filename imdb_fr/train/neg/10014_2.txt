I saw this film during a drive in 1959. Until "Howard the Duck", I considered this film as the worst film I had ever seen. This film tried to combine all genres into one; comedy, horror, teenage anxiety and the "hot rod" that must have spawned "My mother, the car" Maybe it deserves a second visit to see if it's a faithful reflection of his time.
