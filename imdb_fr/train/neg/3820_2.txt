Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. To see a writer, actor, comedian, director and stuntman as phenomenal, subject to this humiliating spectacle, is to see a Picasso used as a protective sheet, or perhaps more to see the most beautiful camembert adulterated with whey and transformed in Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is misinterpreted by Professor Post, whose excessive vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying, "Tell me about rabbits, George." (The message would have said something like, "Please inform me about the status of small mammals of the family of Leporidae of the Lagomorpha order, kind sir, who, in my opinion, is primarily treated with the epithet" George When Keaton created his own characters, they may have been ignorant of the situation, but they were not stupid. They were quick learners and became masters of their worlds. This is not the case for Post, who keeps on stumbling and has no more control over his destiny than a Titanic's hold-down. And while Keaton's original characters had a charming naivety and innocence, Post stands as a sexual retarder so deep that, if he gets really excited physically, he puts a bag of ice on the swelling and asks for medical assistance. . <br /> <br /> There are some small and redemptive moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of vampire Thema Todd or his suggestion of appropriate dress for a Greek dance, but that's not worth the hardly bear the whole film to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, drink and watch "Speak Facily" with friends, at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But other than that, stay with the silents. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.
