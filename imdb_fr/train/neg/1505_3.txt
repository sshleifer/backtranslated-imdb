A typical Italian-Western trash scenario, a stupid story full of clich√©s and lack of logic, mediocre actors, dirty decorations, numerous fist fights and people shot on a large scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my version translated into German, this German version of the DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and asks Macho Callaghan to fight against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed him (he is the only survivor ). Then Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fight each other because they fight and the gang splits. And you have Ironhead fighting everybody because anyway, he's the biggest and most greedy asshole. Yes, that's it, more intelligence in the scenario, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role of Klaus Kinski in the role of Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men who are fighting by hitting them and shouting "I said love!" and in another scene, he wins a horseshoe contest and goes crazy for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It's also remarkable that AMATO's JOE, aka Aristide Massaccesi, did the cinematography - I love this incompetent exploitation-thrash master, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
