Oscar Wilde's comedy of morals, perhaps the most spiritual play ever written, is almost wiped out by a second-rate cast. As might be expected, Sanders is brilliantly brilliant as Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries to accentuate his staging in alternative sentences and the other members of the group seem to believe that it is a melodrama and not a comedy. indeed, all production has notebooks that reduce it to a tragedy - the Hays office has no doubt insisted. Preminger's main goal seems to be to make sure that there are many servants and that even the music seems banal. Keep up with the visually perfect silent farce led by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the piece for the pleasure of words. But ignore this version.
