After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this inexpensive imitation. The story is drawn from great movies such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills Have Eyes". I like this kind of movies, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is corny and the music is stupid and totally lost. You do not care at all about what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are not interesting at all and are rather stereotyped. So what about blood and blood? There is, although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very badly. 2 points, just for blood and blood but understand that it's not worth watching, even for hunting dogs.
