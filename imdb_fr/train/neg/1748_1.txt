Do not waste your time with this movie. It's a total thrash in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a mess of performance from very good actors. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, did a very bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is this what you call playing? I mean, he should thank God for having a pretty face, otherwise he would win Razzie prizes in India if he existed in Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but he is exaggerating more and more. <br /> <br /> A scenario that was not a Boeing Boeing scam in 1965 was poorly framed. First of all, the people of Bollywood simply can not create something original. On top of that, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so exaggerated that it became painful to get through. Priyadarshan is perhaps a star in the south of the country, but he is simply not fit to make a good Hindi film. The sound editing is incredibly nil. I can go back and forth on this subject, but the fact is that Bollywood should be ashamed to make such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that some people seemed to like this movie. What's wrong with you guys? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood produces more movies than Hollywood every year? However, most movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one. I am an Indian and I am absolutely ashamed of Bollywood for producing this thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just great. They are timeless world class movies ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 in 10.
