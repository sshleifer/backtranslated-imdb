If I could give a zero, I would change my mind and give it a -10 instead. An absolutely horrible film without intrigue, does not make sense of what is happening. Just boring. Please do not waste your money on this one. Pleaseee !!! This film could have done so well if it truly described the story of the zodiac killer, but no, I felt nothing but disgust when I watched it. Do yourself a favor and rent classic movies instead, it's best to watch a movie you've seen three or four times already, rather than watching that shit! I do not understand why people bother to make such films when they know it's not going to be okay. The killer Zodiac should rather be called 'Boriac Killer' !!!
