This film was long and boring. Surprising that he was selected for Cannes, although they tend to like pretension. The fact is that unlike other Dutch arty stars like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels totally empty. Moreover, it has no cinematographic quality. A long opening stroke does not mean a cinematic depth, it's just a long and boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not identify at all. The actors did not shine under his direction and sometimes seemed lost. Leopold tried, but that's not the talent I was hoping for. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold has made another attempt.
