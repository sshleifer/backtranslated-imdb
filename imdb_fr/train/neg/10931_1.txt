I went to see this film with rather low expectations, thinking it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not even that. I could hardly sit in the movie without wanting to go out. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even continued asking, "How much longer?" After having lasted until the end, I kept asking myself who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard could not save the banal dialogue, jokes about the state and the banal plot. I would suggest to anyone who has written and directed this film (I use the term loosely) to take an online writing course or move to their local community college for a film class. At least, there are many books about making, scripting, and producing movies that teach them something about structure, intrigue, dialogue, and stimulation.
