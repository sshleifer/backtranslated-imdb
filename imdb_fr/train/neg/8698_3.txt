Okay, I remember watching the first movie, and the boy made it shit. After looking at it, I just laughed and said to myself, "Oh, just another low budget B movie, I'll never see part 2 of it." Then, about a year and a half later, the second part has arrived. It feared even more. But, I just laughed again and said, "It's impossible for me to ever see the third part of it." Then, about a year and a half later, the third part came out. I was stupid enough to praise him and boy, I just cracked after watching him. God, I never really realized how bad movies can be these days. Save $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
