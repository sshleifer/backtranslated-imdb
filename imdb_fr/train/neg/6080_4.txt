'Maladolescenza' looks like a dark fairy tale, with its protagonist children, its forest environment and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. Yet, basically, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study on teenagers. Opening a dreamlike sequence using Fabrizio's not-so-subtle metaphor struggling with his threatening hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised him his love, and his love affair with Sylvie, just as wicked. The psychological complexities of the film give merit to the film, but it is undeniable how the film is exploited unnecessarily in its representation of nudity and sex. The look of the film is based more on its superb locations than on its particular cinematographic talent, and no doubt the biggest asset of the film is its enhanced soundtrack, enriched with children's choir. With its strange dream quality, the film is at best interesting, but pale beside the brilliant surrealist and brilliant "Black Moon" by Louis Malle of the same era. The debate between art and pornography is certainly deserving of merit, because unlike many forbidden movies, like Salo de Pasolini or Ken Park Larry Clark, the film is rather banal from the artistic point of view. The cinema seems to gradually lose its shock capacity, so perhaps Maladolescenza should be admired for having retained this power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value is the only reason the movie is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. Yet Nazism too.
