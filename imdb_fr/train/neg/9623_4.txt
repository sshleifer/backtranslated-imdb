Ben Stiller does not act so much as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that is going on around him. In There, there's something about Mary, the trained hair scene only works because Stiller tries to keep a straight face. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the least funny guy in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by many talents in the field of comics. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, too few. That said, Hoffman relies a little too much on body humor - you know we have problems when they go to fart jokes to make people laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman is having fun is completely overplayed (although she creates a problem in the form of a shirtless opponent who causes a smile - visibly through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to act in a bubble, there are very few reactions. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller could have played a lot, much more. Aniston takes over Rachael, but Stiller is not Ross. This is more of a scenario of "Joey cracking for Rachael". <br /> <br /> Polly is a romantic comedy with numbers, it's his fault - he has a heartache. You do not hang for the characters. With a little more work, we could have had a deeper story, but in the end, the failure of the film is due to poor writing. It's worth watching if it appears on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret making money to see it.
