Not even worth looking at this corny spoiler ruins everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost depreciated by the badly written script and they feel bad at the production. It was very clearly done for television, but if I found it on my TV, I would pass it directly overhead. The children in the movie do a decent job, but the adults who play are incredible and the movie does not really appeal to you. This film lacked music / dance figures that made the original brilliant and really take on Annie's brilliance we all love. Johnson, as Annie is sometimes annoying and restless ... you can not convince yourself that she is really Annie. The differences in appearance of the characters continued to irritate me throughout the film. Sad to say, this sequel was a total failure.
