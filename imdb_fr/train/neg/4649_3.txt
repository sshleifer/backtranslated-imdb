A 1957 production (yes, that's the correct date). J. Arthur Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a sensational comedy, right? Oh, it's just horrible. It's a movie in itself: watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator. The music is thrown away, most inappropriately and forgivably. Jeannie Carson is a lively and competent dancer. But what was she doing in this movie? Diana Dors is here too, providing some very daring shots to use in the previews. Her level of actress is not bad, but she is in the movie to provide someone to ogle. Well, you have to do something next to moan during this movie. The film is now sold on VHS by people on e-Bay. Save yourself the expense and wasted time. A comedy without laughing. A musical without a song or a memorable dance.
