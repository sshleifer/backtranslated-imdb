I remember the time when Kim Basinger was a pretty face that adorned films with characters typical of Blondie mute, romantic interest or damsel in danger.But everything changed when she won an Oscar as Best Actress in a Supporting Role the LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one to be surprised by her strong performance. However, after that time, his career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the prestige she gained through this film made her participate in medium-high-profile films (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we've never seen her on an important character . The movie While She Out Out does not put her in a similar situation; and it is not only that his character is not too tasty, but also that the film is really bad. The scenario of this film could not be more hollow and basic. However, Basinger brings conviction to his character, which makes this poor movie to earn some points.This movie is full of generic cliches and naughty.The work of director Susan Montford is really disastrous for many reasons, but mostly , because the film never gets a good pace and tone.The end of this movie is extremely ridiculous.I do not recommend at all while she was outside.This movie engages the capital sin of being boring.
