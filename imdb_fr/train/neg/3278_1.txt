I must say that many people have argued that some of us have to stick to the weather because the new movie "Dukes" is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If that's what you consider modernized, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site also said that (and I quote) "You, the old fogies, you must rely on and exclude it as is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24 years old, so I'm far from OLD FOGIE, and I will not get over it, it was a disappointment for all of Hazard County . The only thing that is in the title of the movie was "HAZZARD". Was all profanity, smoking and alcohol consumption really necessary? The casting was terrible. Jessica has participated in several morning shows to discuss the film and, frankly, I think everything has fallen into her head. She is by no means a Daisy Duke, a chance maybe, but certainly not Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as a Bo. They should have included the original cast at least in the cameos, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve the script. I mean, people come even today, actors and actresses express a negative opinion, so why do some of you make positive remarks?
