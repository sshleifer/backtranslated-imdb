There is nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you away from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. It's very poor. The acting is awful, the scenario is terrible; and the special effects are overestimated. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat his audience with such contempt? And why did they do a sequel?
