Okay, "enjoy" is a relatively relative term, but flexibility is required when you're dealing with a filmmaker of the caliber of James Glickenhaus. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, extreme action movies I've ever seen, without the nasty side of The Exterminator. Other critics commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the heroic middle-aged commandos of the film, but how about making a film in the Philippines that takes place in Colombia? All extras are Filipino. In fact, the only character to have a Hispanic appearance is the good old Victor Argo, the very revered "El Presidente"! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso who went crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glory of American imperialism.
