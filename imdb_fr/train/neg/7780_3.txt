I could barely stop myself from sinking into my head or just turning that shit off, but I decided to ignore the situation, if only for the reasoning that * something * would happen. -be. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / fx special, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage while making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What turns out to be a lot of acts, slightly hammered or simply mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves like monsters Attacks in the waters of the river (oh, and how lucky a woman gets to be naked in there ... even if there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /> <br /> It's just a foolish thing, but I guess it's not too bad; it is not very odious at all and once or twice we have a semi-interesting glimpse of the Brazilian "culture" (the father who walks around town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of "Hey it's not America! "). But whatever the director's hope in Mitchum's or Carradine's cast, he lost himself at best in a pedestrian dialogue and at worst an atrociously banal and stupid dialogue. It does not help that when we finally get a glimpse of the monster and "action" happens, it is also staged stupidly and has only a shady appeal. Usually, I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of trouble getting an accurate picture - in this case, it took most of the mid-70s - but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it was call ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you get the dual function of the Elvira DVD of this product (bad printing with poor transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to ignore it. Unless, of course, you are an absolute Elvira and you can not help but hear her luscious comment. Personally, I would rather have Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots of the Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.
