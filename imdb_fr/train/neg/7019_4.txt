After seeing the Smother movie poster, I knew I was about to experience one of those intolerable movie experiences that make me want to leave my eyes. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mother is a horrible film, but he is not execrable. This is the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Smother's screenplay (written by The same guys at Sea, which explains why they do not have any talent for writing movies) is humorous, affordable and predictable. Seriously, I have not laughed even once while watching this movie.In addition, the solid cast that I mentioned before is absolutely After the large number of garbage in which it was mixed (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because that I said so), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career goes out. However, I can not forget the excellent performances she has brought previo for decades, on movies like Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother, she does her best for her performance, but her character is so horribly written that she can not do anything with it.Dax Shepard left me a good impression with his strong performances on the movies Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However, he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not go too far.He is a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I would have liked to see that he was one of the writers of this film, instead of acting solely on it.Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation as all the actors mentioned above: be ruined. <br /> <br /> The worst failure of Smother is to be completely boring and insane. His screenplay is nothing more than a set of scenes and forced situations we've seen on sit-coms.See yourself away from this shitty comedy.
