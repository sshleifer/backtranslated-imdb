Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone this Christmas. Drew is not just a millionaire; but also odious and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew returns to the house where he grew up and offers the Valco family, Valco's family, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about it, but learns to love Drew. It's not exactly the same feeling as her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but it also leaves room for change. Drew's girlfriend, Missy (Jennifer Morrison), meets Drew and wants her parents to meet her family. The real pleasure is at the rendezvous because a happy Christmas becomes a nightmare hilarious and dysfunctional. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comical, though strange.
