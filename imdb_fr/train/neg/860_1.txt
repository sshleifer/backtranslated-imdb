Kubrick meets King. It seemed so promising in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out and Kubrick cultists bickered with the king's cultists ever since. <br /> <br /> The King's cultists say that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and ruined it. Kubrick's cultists make fun of King's story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking plans, camera angles. It's a film, they insist: it should be considered alone. It turns out that both sides are correct. Sadly. <br /> <br /> If we consider it only as an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is indeed a failure, a missed opportunity, a series of sloppy narrative gambits. <br /> <br /> I used to blame this on Kubrick's screenwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Divorce, etc.) has the reputation of being a novelist of social morals. Perhaps she was chosen for her subtle understanding of conjugal relationships or family dynamics. But the small blue-collar town of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map of its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick, the Anglophile, probably found him sympathetic. He is of course the real author. And his own scenario for "The Shining" - with his mix of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and implicit reincarnation - does not stand up to logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to consider Kubrick's "Shining" on his own terms. I'm even ready to take it as something other than a conventional horror movie. But it does not succeed either as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness. The film collapses in almost every direction. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind - first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as hallucinations of his father? We notice that every time Jack Torrance is seen talking to a "ghost", he actually looks in a mirror. Note how the maze of topiary hedges of the hotel seems to symbolize Jack's stunted and stunted psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if indeed the "ghosts" of the Overlook are only manifestations of the growing madness of Jack Torrance, then that leaves exactly the prisoner trapped in the closet of the hotel kitchen , while he can continue his fierce fight against the ax? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain, with an impassive face, this Nicholson black-and-white photograph (nicely labeled "1921") as part of a tuxedo - a spectator who left the left field and is on the wall of a ballroom during the last seconds of the film? Should we seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from some sort of "past life" experience? (And if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas of their past?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick did not care about his scenario. Maybe I just wanted to evoke a horror mood. Anyway, the film tries to cover its narrative wagers - to have it in both directions, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This film has not improved with age and certainly does not improve after repeated viewing. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia and goosebumps are scattered, long film. But these gushing Elevators o 'Blood, seen several times in the visions of little Danny, are absurd and laughable. And Jack Torrance's famous slogans ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Only pique the dramatic tension of the film and dispel its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and I heard the audience laughing with relief: "Whew, I'm glad I did not take it seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or completely cynical - during these scenes where Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to mash their son. A hall filled with mummified guests, all sitting in their party hat? Yes, now, I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, we can only assume that he gave exactly the kind of performance that rolls the eyes, frowns and dazzles the landscapes, that the director wanted. The performance of Shelley Duvall, as a female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Poulet", is best missed. <br /> <br /> This film simply does not succeed - not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably deserves a 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it has been so overvalued in this forum.
