I bought leeches on eBay a while ago. I looked at some passages and found it too silly to read it again. The excessive amount of "blood" water at the beginning is simply obsolete - not to mention the sounds of wind "whip". My friends and I made a very low budget movie and the effects always surpassed this crappy festival. <br /> <br /> As for the number of errors in this film, there are too many to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my theater teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: Do not bother with this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of 73 possible)
