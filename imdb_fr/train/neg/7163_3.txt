<br /> <br /> After finishing my "Trance" or "The Eternal", or what the producers call this film, I asked myself: "Of all the bad movies I could have seen could not I have seen at least one that is entertaining? "Even if a movie is not well done in terms of acting, direction, writing or whatever otherwise, it can at least be fun and therefore useful. But this film is not only bad in artistic value, it is incredibly boring. For a plot of such finesse, it moves terribly slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, during a small-eyed entertainment attempt, the death of the characters might have been cold and / or bloody, but the creators of this thing failed in that department as well. <br /> <br /> Does this film go for that? Almost nothing, unless you enjoy watching Christopher Walken, who is able to shine, invests so little in his game that he falls into parody (WHY he decided to do this movie anyway?). I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, worse movies have already been made.
