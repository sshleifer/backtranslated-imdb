It's really one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a huge fan of zombie movie and I generally tolerate bad effects, a stupid story and all you can see in second-rate movies, as long as the movie has a good mood / story / suspension or anything to offer. This one has basically no positive aspect and is third or fourth, or even worse. Some of my friends and I did a little movie for a week of vacation and definitely did a better job (no zombie movie, though). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny, it does not talk about anything else. Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except a white skin drawn on their face), A LOT OF fake blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies being debatable, but the presented gore is just stupid). The camera is quite long with meal scenes, it gets boring and you can not help wondering why zombies use WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the details of dubbing (others have already done so). Although I'm German myself and I'm at least a little curious about the original version, I will not waste any more time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away, as far as possible.
