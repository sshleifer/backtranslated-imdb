Famous writer Mark Redfield (Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer old outbuildings and start a new life as a magazine publisher in Baltimore, Maryland. However, power outages, delirium and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts. He would also like to revive romance with an old love, a perspective tainted with mistakes, as it should be. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses a lot of black and white photographs, color and tricks to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) works well, relatively speaking. It is not enough.
