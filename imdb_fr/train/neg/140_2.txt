Valentine is a horrible movie. That's what I thought: <br /> <br /> Interpretation: very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The other was not much better. <br /> <br /> History: The story was going well, but it could have been more developed. This film had the potential to be a good movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name "Paige Prescott" recognizes Prescott? <br /> <br /> Final result: Do not see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
