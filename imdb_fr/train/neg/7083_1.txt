My husband rented this at a video store thinking it was suspense. (He never reads the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be funny if the thing was visible. It's just not. The same thing again and again, no intrigue, and O did they find the leading man? Michael Des Barres, the main man, is not even really handsome, especially for this role. In addition, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent "Disclosure" from Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is generally observable, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also cheaper lighting effects than your webcam at home. Do not even waste time renting this. 0/10.
