This film is hard work, but it's totally lacking in the 1960s TV show, which I'm sure people remember fondly. Even though I'm 17, I watched some YouTube shows a long time ago and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film does little justice to the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rather mediocre, and the work of the flat camera did not help. The script was also dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humor. Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and The Magic Railroad, and Addams Family Reunion are some of the other films that lack the script. <br /> <br /> Now, I would say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately, was poorly executed and ran out of breath much too early, and honestly, I'm not sure for this is why the family will be able to enjoy it. And the costume annoyed me, despite the enthusiastic voice of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But what annoys me the most in this film is that the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah have been lost. , all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has done a good performance before, but he did not seem to have a clue what he was supposed to do. The character of Elizabeth Hurley has unfortunately seemed useless. Daryl Hannah is a charming actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea that it is the love interest, but unfortunately, you see very little (not to mention the Monster attack that could scare children than to delight them) Shawn as a type of government agent. Christopher Lloyd does it better, and as an actor, I really like Lloyd (he has participated in two of my favorite movies, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love Back to the Future), but he did not have a lot of work with him, and tended to react wildly. <br /> <br /> Overall, even though I wanted to love this movie, I was not impressed. Instead of being fun, it seemed useless, and it's a shame, because it had a lot of potential, with talented actors and a good idea, but wasted by bad execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
