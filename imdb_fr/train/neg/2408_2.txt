This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. He uses it for the first time on his brother when he is shot in a car. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some scenes, the zombies walk very slowly and in others, they run fast enough, which does not make much sense. The acting is mediocre but the story does not help the film. Makeup is made of blood on the faces of zombies. I'm sure the budget for this movie was very limited. I think the film could have been better done if the story had been more original and with a better budget. If you do not want to see a good movie of zombies, do not see it.
