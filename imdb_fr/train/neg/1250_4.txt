I must admit that this "reinvention" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Especially when you consider that this is a Tim Burton movie. He is without doubt one of the most original and cool filmmakers Hollywood has produced. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm a big fan of his work, but obviously his latest film, The Planet, went wrong. monkeys. I really enjoyed the original movie. When it appeared, people were expecting another science fiction movie from the 70s, but a very surprise proved that this theory was wrong. The message was clear. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it carried the world, and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played an important role in the minds of filmmakers. These reasons made the film exceeded all expectations and became an instant classic. Although the new film, the "re-making" or other, leaves us nothing. No message, no ideal behind. It's just another summer blockbuster for profit. <br /> <br /> Visually, Tim Burton will not let you down. The dark and scary decorations were excellent and of course, the makeup was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Obviously, that's not enough to keep the audience in a movie. There must be a plot or an exciting storyline. In this film, the plot is extremely uninteresting and extremely misguided. The script is very lame and it is full of gaps. Looks like this film was written very quickly. The explanation of why the monkeys were there and the reason the planet was governing was indeed very stupid and proved the writers' ignorance. <br /> <br /> This raised many questions, which did not have a reasonable answer. <br /> <br /> For example; Why do monkeys speak English? Why were there other species of monkeys than chimpanzees on the planet (knowing that there were only chimpanzees in the spacecraft that crashed on the planet) Where did all these humans come from? How have some chimpanzees been transformed into a huge increase of all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years? (I mean, it took us a few million years to move from monkey to man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the bad surprise ended just like a silent airplane. This was probably added because the original film had such an end, so they felt that the audience was expecting the same kind of end. The end also raises many questions, which, I know, do not have intelligent answers. Did Theid learn to work with the spaceship, which was powerless, and learned to fly in time and seize the hand of the world? "And what did it do to breed with all the women? And let's say that would happen, I doubt very much that the story would remain the same, as if Washington would be built in exactly the same way as today. Hui! (I mean there would not be a huge banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something positive about the movie Some of the actors were great The character of Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well played, as for Tim Roth in Theid, he was very good, a little exasperated at times in the movie Michael Clark Duncan was just as good I was not happy with Marc Whalberg He is not really an actor and plays a colorless, very macho character here, very impossible to understand and is nothing compared to the character of Hestons in the original. place in the movie, it was just cast for the eyes. a word throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I think in the future, when people think of Planet of the Apes, they will think of the original. The last ones will soon be forgotten.
