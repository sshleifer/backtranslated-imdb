Basically, this is a comedy / action too long and not very funny. First of all, I would like to say that I liked Brother Wayans Scary Movie (1) and that the following took a few moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even give half a laugh. <br /> <br /> The humor is absolutely raw. If you like cunning, foolish and stupid expressions, you should probably look at this. When it's not rude, it's silly. The first 10 minutes of the movie revealed everything to me, totally insane, just stupid. <br /> <br /> However, I have watched everything since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not have worried). The story is undeniably thin, it was in a horror movie too but at least the laughter was fast and constant. I think this is probably one of the main problems of this film, the laughter does not come fast enough. Some jokes are dragged too long when they are more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comedy with some brain cells, avoid it. If you want a silly comedy with more laughs, watch scary movie, plane, 1 + 2 photos. 1/10 Completely without fantasy, Thin storyline, A movie that seems to be based on an idea (ie if we disguised ourselves as white chicks for a movie?) but simply did not have enough material.
