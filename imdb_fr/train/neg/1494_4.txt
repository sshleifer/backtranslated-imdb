Yes, certainly better than my vision of Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the dead were quite original and the gore was decent. It was a bit like Wrong Turn was meeting the Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When "children" (high school or college?) discuss horror movies in the kitchen, all that Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about busty girls, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Was not Steve a Randy Scream bootleg? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what did the film have to do with Samhain? Quite useless if you ask me. I find it funny to see these 80s horror movies explaining things by pointing fingers at druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) They made a reference to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? These are characters who have nothing to do. And he's so psychic that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at that time, the dead simply became Troma-licious) how could she hear the screams when she was down but did not hear them when she stood in front of the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on the Haggis, mostly a Scottish and non-Irish dish. <br /> <br /> 8.) The lesson, then, is if you are like Shae and you do not have fun or smile at the whole movie, will you live it? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like plates of con carne chile. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve HAD was tied there and wondering where he came from? 11.) Was there not more than one killer? Shae beat him, but did not meet him anymore. <br /> <br /> 12.) What was the turning back for these other people? Half of them, Shae, did not know if they were dead or alive, so what was going on with that? 13.) Why did not they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why did no one ever call the police? And apparently everyone knew that these people lived in the woods, why did they never organize a kind of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires. How could she "transform" herself at the end? I'm with everyone on the giant "huh?" at the end. <br /> <br /> Much better than the tunnel of death, but still very sloppy. I still do not understand why they even placed it in Ireland, considering that Samhain had virtually nothing to do with the plot.
