After watching many "Next Action Star" reality shows, TiVo filmed this horrible tripe for me. For some strange reason - and I can only blame myself - I watched everything, hoping there would be a single event in the whole movie. After so much fuss over Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action movies, he might want to make sure he's doing his alchemy well. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only value that bought the whole movie was Billy Zane. and even he could not lift the neglected writing of the crapper. That said, Zane's performance wobbles about two-thirds of the race, as he does not even seem to know what to do other than look blissful. <br /> <br /> But I can not blame him here. The writing, frankly, was nil. Let's take the ideas of "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and any bad gambling movie you can think of and reorganize simply. And who had the brilliant idea to have two sequences of pursuit bridge in a footprint? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, "the man of the hour" of "The Next Action Star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the cast. Administrators mention throughout the series of the series. One note at a time, Sean plays the stupid jock very well, but struggles to support the weight of the movie. Quite frankly, we never really seem to care whether he lives or dies about halfway through, because Carrigan gives no reason to his audience to love him. His idiotic but lucky routine is getting old, because there is really nothing about the character itself. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the stiff and woody Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell him to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I was still expecting her to quote Arnie. His character "performance" can only be compared to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered", although much less developed. The camera likes it in dark, dark limousines, but in the light of day, its behavior sucks all the energy from the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five-minute role that Corinne did not show at any time of her appearance on the screen. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sean has the good-looking sturdy look to provide a good lead in an overall cast, but should not have been left to do this solo. It was just too big a task for him. Next Action Star colleague Jared Elliot may not have had more luck with a more dynamic characterization, but it is hard to say given Jeff Welch's lame scenario. Someone should take Welch's iMac before he gets hurt or hurts someone. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outclassed and out of reach, even for a full game like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
