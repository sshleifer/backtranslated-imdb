This film is so bad and gets worse in every way imaginable. It's not just the poor actors and the scenario, nor the lame and perverse time that we lose to watch it. What really puts this film in my shame is the apparent struggle that writers and producers make with the film to try to make it funny. The actress replacing the descendant of Jean Reno is too old and learned her lesson in the first film so that they add a new girl who has to get married. Almost all the extras and original gags come back, but this time, I want to get my eyes out of my sockets because it is a waste of perfect film. The torture of the cuts and constant shots in all the scenes of this film can lead the spectator to violent turns. This second film takes the original to success and the fate of his coffin, scrolls the corpse in the public square and degrades perverse not only the original idea and its heritage, but also our intelligence. Unlike spruce, this movie could not fly because there was no intrigue in the principles that came back for a "necklace". No script because it has apparently been written and added to the daily newspaper. No attention to the camera or the shots in mind. Bad lighting and special effects made to do it. This film would not even pass for a student film in the base film 101. How did this pile go through, no one can tell. It was a big investment in decline and it seems that no one had the strength to repair this cruel and unnatural mistake of our miseries. This film has a good part ... its END! This movie is my worst movie of all time. Finally, "Howard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
