What is ...........? This is without a doubt the biggest waste of film, settings and camera. I know you can not set your expectations for a High Slasher 80, but it's too stupid to be true. I bought this film for $ 0.89 and I still feel the need to go and claim my money. Can you imagine who has the STINS? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motives ??? In fact, you could not worry less. And why should you? The makers of this trash can not care less. They did not try to create a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that) also directed the film Kindred (1986), which was rather nice and recently, he made Soul Survivors. Full shit too, but at least this one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the beginnings of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Which ??) Yeah that's right, the Melrose Place chick. His very memorable character dies about 15 min. after opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly at the first minute, but no one seems to mention it or miss it after, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the term actors in fact, are completely uninteresting. You hope they die quickly and painfully ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
