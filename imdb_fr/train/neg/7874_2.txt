In a way, Corridors of Time is a success because the film reaches its goal: to be seen by thousands of people. But that does not manage to make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> The Visitors were successful, because the subject was an original way to consider the journey in time: forget the Return to the future of Zemeckis, here is the old France, the middle-aged knight and his almost barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the rest. <br /> <br /> No one had foreseen the tremendous success of The Visitors, the first. And there is no point in being a movie expert at realizing that Corridors of Time were created for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of the Visitors and immediately attempts to justify the continuation over time. paradox that would have needed a second thought. Explanation: There is no point trying to recover the jewels stolen by Jacquouille; You do not remember that beautiful bright and expensive red car he bought at the end of the 1st episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​jewelry ... And this is just one of the many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde ... it's another story: Valerie Lemercier decided not to compromise in this sequel to not get stuck in the role of the bourgeois. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I find so pitiful that I almost hurt her. And Poiré does not realize that a cast of comedians is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget the time travel, the digital effects, focus on the story and you'll see that there is enough room on a postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A film for young people, say up to 13 years old.
