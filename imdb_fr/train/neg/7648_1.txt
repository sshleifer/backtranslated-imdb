It is considered a way of highlighting all the social ills resulting from patriarchy and male domination, as ridiculous as this illogical "logic" may be. However, in the story and the theme of the film, there is no gray area and the woman who should be called the antagonist of the film is the "villain of history". In any case, what she has done can not be justified. The sexuality of women is a hype in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It is a betrayal of the ultimate kind. The man ends up devoting his resources and his time to the useless breeding of the offspring of another man. To top it off, the weakest of the arguments raised by the 3 female characters "liberated" from the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs do not allow her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and, worse yet, there are no other children. So, in essence, his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations lead to the execution of unfairness.
