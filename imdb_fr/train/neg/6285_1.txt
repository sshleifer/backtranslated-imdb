Horror movie ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what is the purpose of this movie ??? the movie almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes, it's just that Lena walks with that stupid look on her face after an accident ... does not talk much, not even a lot of actions at all .. I must say, the last 20 menus were very tiny ... and were still stupid ....... and the end oh my god, I do not know where to start, it also ends up that stupid look on Lena's face lol .. do not get me wrong, I love Lena Headey, I think she's a great actress, but I do not know what pushed her to do this movie .. do not waste your time to watch because this film has no history, has no role to play ... and makes no sense ... not to mention the slowness of this film and it has the impression that you look at it forever .
