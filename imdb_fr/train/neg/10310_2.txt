Lorenzo Lamas embodies a certain type of CIA agent, who captures an exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps his daughter and forces her to fight against her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on the verge of providing a touch of interim credibility to the less talented ensemble. I must admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. He smells bad. However, compared to Kinmont, the comic wife of O.J Simpson and Lamas, Lamas seems to be ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because of the renewed interest in the O.J Simpson trial, you see, because if your parents had extra cable and channels, you could not escape that movie. in 1994, you could go to an Amish community and some morons would play in their portable TV. The film itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intriguing although the shock value of O.J Simpson who jumps after fireballs and exchange is a dubbing that provides some unintentional humor. Also, where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make it a camp classic? <br /> <br /> * on 4- (bad)
