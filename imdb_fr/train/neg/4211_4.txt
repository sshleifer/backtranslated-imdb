About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it again and again and again. But now ... I do not do it. In fact, I think this film would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It contains many highly commented actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a nice complacent script. My favorite part is when Culkin rides a bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler, where are you going?" Also look for the classic line "Do you have the feeling of being in your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than "The good son".
