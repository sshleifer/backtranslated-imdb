My first clue to the seriousness of the situation was when the story of the video was told by the people who brought us the Blair Witch project, a masterpiece compared to this garbage can. The acting was of the caliber of a Grade 6 Oklahoma production and the plot, as it existed before, is predictable, boring and inept. 85% of the script is composed of four letter words and innumerable variations. Mother F seems to be the favorite of "the writer" because it is used constantly. It took 10 minutes to write this script during a dive on the last call. Thank goodness, I rented it and I was able to skip the essentials in advance. Do not waste your time and money with that.
