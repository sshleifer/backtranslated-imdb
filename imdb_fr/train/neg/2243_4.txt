This does not even merit criticism, except as a warning to potential viewers. It's a generic generic story about an actress who haunts a studio during the filming of a drama of the Second World War. There is no fear, no suspense, no surprises. A shocking moment that seems a little too silly to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and dull, although there are very good montages from time to time. The story never comes together, and the movies are really a total collapse. 4/10.
