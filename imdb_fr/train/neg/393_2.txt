For all those who want to remake Slaves of New York in 1989. What is it, seven of you? Here it is ... it was. <br /> <br /> This undercooked film presents studiously insipid characters (well, they are club kids, a big cunt!) who are in keeping patterns. The big question is: How long can a young adult stay a minor? It took three people to write this "story"? God, it was easier to find Citizen Kane. Rather than bringing viewers back into the background, this film should simply embarrass anyone who was staged in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> the era is the world as only absorbed by oneself even twenty years could imagine it. The odd sidebar on library work is not the expected sub-parcel of Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo equivalent. His "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper squeaks her, she is hysterical. Posey's shtick is always fun, but there are projects below her. I was asleep before he broke the 40-minute mark.
