Movies on dinosaurs can be entertaining. Whoopi Goldberg can too. But whoopi AND the dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to a conclusion: this film is diabolical. Maleficent, vile, nasty and reprehensible in his spite for the public. Nothing so serious is done by accident. This is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not do good action movies (look at "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the directors do not have it is a tough cop here, again. <br /> <br /> Have you seen a million cop cop movies this week? Well, here's the number one and one, buddy. <br /> <br /> You do not like animated, cute and humanistic dinosaurs since this Spielberg TV show about them? Too bad, here's another one and he's also a cop! <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who hate car chases, shootings, sloppy dialogues, the boring effects of futurists and the talented people Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a deduction tax? A big tax deduction? <br /> <br /> And you read this review until the end. You deserve a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really follow "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a flock of cracked foam rubber dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now, I would pay to see it.
