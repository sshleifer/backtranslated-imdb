The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that just does not work in part with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow runs through the whole movie with a confused look, and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer sees even in her. <br /> <br /> However, The Pallbearer is sometimes funny, especially the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer only for these scenes and quickly advance the rest. Believe me, you do not miss a lot.
