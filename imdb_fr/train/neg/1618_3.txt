I went to see this film with the most positive expectations. I had already seen Jacquet's previous film (The Penguin March) and heard a very positive review of it on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. Above all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally, nothing happens. I tried to describe the content of the film to a friend, and we ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like "then winter comes, then spring, and then there is an eagle and a river, and once it's dark and the girl goes into a cave, and another time, the fox has babies "and so on. After about half an hour, I began to sigh, yawn, roll my eyes, cursing the critic on the radio, and hoping it would be over soon. But the film continued again and again. In the end, I had sunk so deep into my chair that I had to look a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most boring parts of the film are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give the children an identity with which to identify themselves. She wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, there is no doubt. However, a film about the beauty of nature like this would have gone better without his too human presence. I found myself constantly hoping it could be eaten by a bear, drowning in the river, or something so terrible. (b) The commentary of the adult voice of the girl, who tells us nothing but trivial things, obvious, boring and redundant. c) Music, which is sorely lacking in subtlety. When the girl jumps happily, the music jumps too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music also becomes threatening. It reminded me of the early days of movie making and was too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many children who saw the film with me liked it, at least they got involved in one way or another. So, my warning is only for adults: if you're over ten, avoid this movie. You can sleep better (and cheaper) in most other places.
