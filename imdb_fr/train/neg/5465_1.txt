This film occupies a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It's about as much fun as doing hard manual work with stomach cramps. The film starts badly (I would say that the first minutes of the film were 1/10) and then it gradually gets worse, minute after minute. The only way to note it would be a kind of abyssal spiral negative number that would swell for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video. In one way or another, the video even manages to make grotesque and unpleasant women cute and slightly dressed. This movie is incredibly bad. I would say that it would be better to stay locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over again and with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM THE buzzing in your ear rather than watching this movie. The suites are not so bad. If you have to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliet or Combat Shock. I would rather watch 5 infomercials of Tony Little back to back rather than review CLASS of NUKEM HIGH. Do not get me wrong, it took a criminal genius to make such a dreadful movie and if ever a movie deserved a price for being awful, that's all.
