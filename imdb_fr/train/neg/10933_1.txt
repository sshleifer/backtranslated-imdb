Destroy all the stereotypes and misrepresentations you've heard about semi-devout Mormons and you'll see that they all played in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally, the fortune of Kurt Hale has changed (thank God) and we hope that the film will not be shown in cinemas long before. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amateurish (I think they used a camcorder for basketball scenes). The plot was soft and very funny. You really did not understand why someone was doing something. It was like sand in my eyes and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this movie a negative note was because the scale will not let me.
