Sometimes I rest my head and think about why killer shark and / or crocodile movies are still being made today. They have been making these lame "bite" copies since the 1970s, it's not like we like them better. The idea is always exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts to murder people. First, he destroys secondary characters, then he begins to attack the main characters, usually played by a few unknowns, except for the one who was a little more famous and who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill the animal, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid, etc. etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you count the fact that the "specialist" is captain in this variant, your criteria are rather low. It's funny that he was played by Duncan Regehr, he's totally used to being Zorro. Well, I'll give him a bonus point for that.
