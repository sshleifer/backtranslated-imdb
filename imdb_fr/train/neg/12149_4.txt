Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses is a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, this could apply to the way the United States tries to control the media during the war in Iraq, but it sounds hollow. There is never much tension in the story and the acting is never very good. Worse still, the direction of the film is atrocious, focus more on odd camera angles that transmit nothing beyond "Is not that a strange way to hold the camera." The special effects are pretty bad ... at one point, the video of an explosion is projected in green on the city, and it is at best laughable. <br /> <br /> The film has some bright spots ... namely advertisements for post-zombie services (including a recovery service and a party bus). But it is far too little for the film is worth it. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same low production value, but there is a lot more wit, humor and talent behind that.
