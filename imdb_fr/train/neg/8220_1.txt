Less than 10 minutes after the beginning of the film, I wanted to finish it because it was painful. All this "horror" movie was about a group of whiny bitches who were doing silly things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let the positive reviews fool you, because it's really a terrible movie and you really should not watch it. <br /> <br /> The movie script had the potential to be awesome, but it simply does not happen. A group of five "teenagers" come home on a car night while they are chased by a crazy driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes after the beginning of the film, the characters are already arguing and it does not stop. For 90 minutes, all we have is a group of girls who moan, cry, scream, "play" and argue. None of the dialogues is so interesting, so you do not really have to know these characters or appreciate them. <br /> <br /> The action was terrible and I was shocked to discover that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women appeared to be under the age of 20, and one of them easily made her feel almost 30 years old. Get at least people who are old. None of them even gave decent shows, and just seemed to have been picked on the street or be friends of the director without any ability to act. The actress who played the killer abused her, but she at least showed something the other girls did not do: a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny and stupid bitches. That's all I can say about them, and it did not help everyone survive. If I have to go into details, in a scene, the girls are chased by the killer and their car is often hit. A girl gets hurt and moans about it ... four of them do not wear a seatbelt ... what are you waiting for? One of your friends is brutally attacked by the killer ... and you are all comfortable "too hurt" to help? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> The filming is absolutely terrible. I do not care if this movie had a peanut-sized budget, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed somewhere against a window and the number of times that the camera faded, trembled and brushed against an "actress" was horrible. It was also grainy, and sometimes you could not hear what the characters were saying (not that it was worth listening to). <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the killer's car in the movie (who would have been affected even though we only heard about the crash) is actually the director's car in real life astonishing that they did not show the car hit! This film is so cheap, they can not even show a car a bit scuffed. Oh, I must mention the soundtrack too ... if that's what it was. It was horrible ... sad a second, then hard rock the next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes looks like a terrible home movie shot in the middle of the road at night with a group of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. It does not help when the scenario is terrible, the fear / tension / suspense and (that there is no cure to compensate) are absent, that the action is terrible and that the quality of the image and filming are horrendous. <br /> It was a horrible film on a budget. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
