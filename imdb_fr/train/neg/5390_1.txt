Make no mistake, it's not a horror or a movie. I strongly advise against looking at this 82-minute failure; The only reason he deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a movement of surprise, a hint of surprise, a plot that is emerging - but no. <br /> <br /> The characters take irregular turns in their actions and Do not have time to develop - thanks to frugal editors and writers frankly ashamed - before returning to an idyllic and playful state (bring the teen rock montage). The only thing that could have aggravated the situation would be to add the perishable symbolic ethnic "companion". <br /> <br /> Their encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are brief, confusing and totally useless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine fights to stay on the surface of the earth while drowning under the weight of a light melt. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be drier if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada Desert. <br /> <br /> Look at "The Road", look at "28 days later", watch TV during the day ... everything but that; I beg you. Suffer from boredom, contrary to what you might believe in the film, this movie is not a cure.
