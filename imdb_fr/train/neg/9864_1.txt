As a player, I can not say that I like this movie. The fact is, I hate that. I tried to watch it as open as possible, but when you get there, you feel pretty insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons for this. <br /> 1. The characters do not look natural. I met a lot of players from all walks of life. I do not know anyone who behaves like one of the characters in the movie. It's as if the producers of the film had taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and have all grouped them into 5 people. Most players are rather social people, some with a rather active life. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The fake documentary style is poorly adapted to the subject of the film. A documentary about players would work better. Although it is beautiful (that is to say well designed), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack real context. Players swear, I admit, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is lacking. Although self-disparaging humor is one of the pillars of my group and many other groups I've met, it's less about self-depredation and more like toilet humor. Similarly, much of the player's humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, no toilet humor. Most players hesitate and flee from anyone who makes such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: accuracy. I do not speak of rules, but of dynamics. Invariably, this film will be compared to even more economical films, The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, which both present the players as real players. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie presents a situation in which you want to beat the insane gamers against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Uh, I know a guy like that ... Yeah, it's really like Gary. "
