Could not go to sleep the other night. So I got up, I shot the tube and the movie started. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers bit more than they could chew. As ambitious as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump reads like a fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era. TGMB relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to block it. The goal of each character was to fill a silly 1960s archetype. <br /> <br /> Find out how we discovered Finnegan: hugging his darkroom maid and receiving a framed MLK picture. Criminey, talking about badass. Why not just give him a t-shirt saying "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Is not this a free love, man? Oh no, I did not get my period." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not in UCLA's place." Uh, excuse me? LA in the 60s was nothing like it. Rather than taking the time to demonstrate how Berkeley is unique, we simply hear this kid whining about not going there. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the black kid. It was just an accessory used to show how much other children were tolerant of the breed. <br /> <br /> That's right, vintage pieces do not have to be so old-fashioned. Take "Dazed & Confused". Watch how we introduced football hero Randall Floyd. We do not see him first on the football field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We were introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish friends to poker for a party. <br /> <br /> In "Dazed", feminism is not an occasional by-product of some type being overthrown. It's a lot more organic, more serious than that. In the ladies' room, the debate was refined during an informal discussion on Gilligan Island. Serious ideas can develop in the most mundane environments. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here note that the themes of this film are still relevant. I agree! That's the reason why I'm so disappointed by this piece of Baby Boomer pornostalgia.
