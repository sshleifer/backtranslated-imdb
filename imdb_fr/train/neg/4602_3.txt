A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a gangster for money. Then they cross him. In the meantime, he falls in love with the deceased's wife and, without her knowing that he is the killer, settles with her. Then he "kills" her by accident when she finds out. Then, in a kind of heroism, he takes revenge on the mobsters who have doubled him. The first problem is that by agreeing to murder by lease, the vagrant loses all sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We can not accept any goodness in him and therefore the rest of society has no moral center. We just can not care about that kind of guy. And his wife (well played by the chore Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff of EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class woman who runs a homeless mission, also loses some sympathy by throwing herself in bed with the vagabond obviously weakened after the death of her husband). And when she discovers he's the guy ?? What is she doing? She locked him up at her house (as if ALL the houses had locks that you could not open from inside) with her and started scolding him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is terrific in his role as a sturdy thug. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
