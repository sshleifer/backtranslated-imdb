It's very amusing to watch "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural garbage film. It's like a response to Jess Franko's movie type B. Bodybuilders hit (! Face to face!) The pushers.The shot very very very stupid! Action: Incredibly bad shooting scenes are even better than hand-to-hand combat. Ridiculous scenes. Save scenes of incredibly stupid beauties. Erotic scenes are very sober. Do not miss: the joke of Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of the film and the list of parents of Franco Columbu at the end. Special attraction: bare chest.Almoust has forgotten - Franco knows how to sing!
