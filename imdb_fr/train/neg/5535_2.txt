I think the biggest fault can be boring. Evil is actually better than boring This thing has no breath. It is interesting to take place in Cambodia. How many American movies of the 30s are taking place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict is a bit difficult to understand. Even troop movements are a bit confusing. The love story is the biggest hindrance. I do not know why these two guys are so completely annihilated by the hot blonde. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (as they are) and forget everything about him. The film is moving fast. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest across the water to the secret place where hieroglyphs (or something else) are kept that explain how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never make it. A guy walks two steps. He stops. He looks around him. The other guy is hiding behind columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around him. The other guy is hiding behind bushes. It's the film in a few words. Then there is the bad acting and the insipid dialogue. In fact, I have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is unbearable. By the way, a more appropriate title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.
