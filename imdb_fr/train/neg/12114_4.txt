The strange inhabitants of a city live their lives pretty much. There is the licker, a guy who licks everything, a dumpster diver who finds a body he takes to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean girls from their bad ways ... shifted to the extreme, this black and white film is better without the color. Monochrome attenuates the feel of home theater. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun in jolts but most of the time, it's weird for strange reasons and quickly becomes boring, since you see the fixtures that you can guess where it's happening often - not always - but enough so that it is not fun (although I did not see the purification coming). It's worth it if you have nothing else to watch and you're waiting for the next Netflix Golden Girls series.
