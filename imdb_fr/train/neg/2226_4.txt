DD's films were pretty tacky, really stupid and had a plot that seemed thin, but at the time it was at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a comedy, but a mix of melodrama, romance, all <All theater scenes are out of proportion </ b> <br /> Comedy is funny but cheesy too. Yet, the film is entertaining you. On those days, Govinda's films were noisy, rude and yet amusing. moments that people have appreciated <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is fine <br /> <br /> Govinda plays well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in places and annoys by Kader places is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra are typecast Shakti is hilarious
