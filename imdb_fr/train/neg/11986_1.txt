What horrible writing and acting. No personality. What, you can not make a good movie with one character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with personal dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this kid goes on a trip to see his father. The kid, Jason, is flying. The pilot has a heart attack and dies in midair. Then the boy crashes into a lake and survives. Then he runs, surviving in the desert until his rescue. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he fights a bear twice. The first time, he fights in the lake. The second time he makes a spear with a branch and throws the bear. Two shots of fake blood gushing from the bear's chest reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". <br /> <br /> The kid has also decided to kick a porcupine into a predictable kick. <br /> Gag.
