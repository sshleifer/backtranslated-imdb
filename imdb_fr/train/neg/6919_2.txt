My roommates and I almost shifted our television to the many pin plugs we took while watching this hilarious play of self-important pseudo-zen dreck from the 1970s. I've been reading this festival for chandeliers and scanned my local TV channels late at night looking for YEARS looking for that elusive shit. Several years ago, our local affiliate ABC was known for its cool movies for its late-night weekend (eg, "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). And then one day, it happened: it was 1:40 on Saturday night (more than 5 years ago)! We had more than 15 people and the movie did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith as the most foolish and least threatening villain since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> You see! William Shatner carries above his head a variety of things that resemble weakly human hair (or anything organic in this case). <br /> <br /> Listen! a stupid jaw of the 1970s, a psychobabble that gives BF Skinner's "Chicken Soup For The Soul" <br /> <br /> Feel! Content that any decade was better than that of the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who still read ... the plot identifies a group of middle-class tits who decide to reach theirs --- The business leader (Griffith) joining him in a cross-dessert race that covers California and Mexico. They all wear a leather jacket and look more like Christopher Street. Along the way, they stop at a cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (Robert "Mike Brady", Reed, smoke a joint is an image you will not soon forget), fight, try to rape and act as a group of suburban outlets of the middle class. Although I have a great copy that I recorded on TV, I want it to be broadcast on video so that the whole world can enjoy its half-fooled idiot.
