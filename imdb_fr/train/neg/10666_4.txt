I'm a big movie fan of the 1930s and I'll watch almost everything I see on Turner Classic Movies, which is new to me. So I tried it. After all, it was the great Harold Lloyd who competed with Chaplin as a great silent film comic. I watched Lloyd's silent films a lot less than Chaplins, but I have to say that I'm a much bigger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie fell so flat for me that I did not finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he did not have a very good material with which to work. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, the Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy doing periodontal boxing (or violence in general), this one is very memorable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou because I really enjoyed it in Paths Of Glory, but his role here also brought me nothing special. Maybe they should have gone into boxing earlier because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed like that) is before he gets into a ring. I can say that there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and it will not be a popular critic, but I have to evaluate that compared to what was at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not look that with someone you are trying to watch. like old movies, because they may not be able to watch another one again, very flat. For an alternative to those who really like it or who are looking for lesser-known comedies in general, I recommend "Kelly The Second" directed a few years ago, another person does not become a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role with Charles Chase. Both have been shown on Turner Classic Movies.
