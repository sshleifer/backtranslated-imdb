... so you'd better not watch this movie. They completely ruined the scene of the show. In the movie, Duke's boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg can, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are faithful to the original characters. At least Enos is a bit close. <br /> <br /> At one point, they open the doors of General Lee - nuff, he says. <br /> <br /> The original show may not have been great, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This film is like Dumb & Dumber meets the simple life.
