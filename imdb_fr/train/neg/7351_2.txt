Sometimes you need to see a bad movie to enjoy the good ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This one will always be in the category of bad films, simply because everything, except the performance of Shu Qi, has been terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel talks about Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who turned right after leaving her lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years ago. But her past comes back to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for ransom security software belonging to the Cat company. In order to save him, she calls her old friends from her orphanage, six other brave women, to save the situation ... <br /> <br /> I may have said in the synopsis an air of cheese, but is a cheese story. In fact, the script and the direction did not present any quality. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and was associated with a plot as thin as rice paper in the water. If I can summarize, take a bad film from Jackie Chan, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a stereotypical work without imagination. <br /> <br /> Notice, I have to acknowledge the merit, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to come out unscathed from this terrible action, because it was his performance that shone. Okay, you can not say she was great - after all, she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she managed to get a character out of her role. Apart from that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin have left another impression, although they are mostly glimmers and very brief. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the film has just fallen apart. The scenes and dialogues were completely artificial and incredible, special effects were obviously done cheaply, without attempting to clean the contours of people and the mask of the blue screen, a mediocre editing with many discontinuities in the fight scenes , basic and unflattering angles of view. and direction that I have seen better from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I guess this movie was a case of too many cooks. Most likely, the budget was blown away by the excitement of having seven girls on the same silver screen. It did not leave much else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was designed as a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's angels, it's not. In fact, although the sisters could do it themselves, none of this was really obvious here. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, something to forget.
