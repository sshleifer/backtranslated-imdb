I came to this film with great expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and "The Tempest" and I was interested in an adaptation. I first wanted to turn off after ten minutes, but I thought it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but where do you think a little boy is pissing over a toy boat? It's symbolic of what? I continued for another ten minutes to wave my finger on the 'off' button, somewhere something would attract my interest. It's not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. There is a time and a place for that, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for that in my Shakespeare studies. After twenty-five minutes, I gave up and it was the end. I then read all the comments on this site and the claim of the film is matched only by its accused. 'It's a painting ..... then put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage then'. Shakespeare can be played intelligently, and the plays were performed before a mass audience, they were accessible, and this version creates a gap between Shakespeare and the general population - and I do not think the bard would be happy.
