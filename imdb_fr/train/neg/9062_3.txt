This film was different in that it did not show the typical gay stereotypes that I'm used to seeing. But that does not change the fact that it is totally missing a scenario. I'm sure there are a lot of gay men who are just happy to be represented on the screen, because black gay characters are rarely seen and when they are, the characters are usually not fully developed. But how difficult would it have been for the writer to write a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Or how about a story that has been targeted. There really does not seem to be any purpose to this film, and even if it's a low-budget movie, it's still not an excuse for lack of story or plot.
