This comedy contains pretty funny stuff, surrounded by a lot of crazy things. Almost all the scenes involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics are a waste of time. And the plot is so sloppy that one wonders if they had a script ready before starting to film the film, or if they invented everything as they went. (* 1/2)
