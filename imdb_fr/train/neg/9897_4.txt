I thought it was a good movie to spend your time, but no chance of historical value. The portrait of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The turn of events is ... funny! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? O please ... A pregnant Egyptian queen (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to another for this reason! They tried to make him appear a saint for the sake of God! And the way they tried to justify his murder of his own sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. His decisions were based on something other than his feelings and his morals. It did everything for just two reasons: power and self-preservation! She was born into a family where she had to struggle to survive, which she did very well. Everything that happened to him was murdered (his brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to be killed and too ... gay to be seduced. So, it was his end ...
