I can not believe that this kind of unusual and jingoistic material is passed on to the Americans as art house material. From the beginning, from revealing lines such as "we want to make sure they play for the right team" and a framing and a manipulative light, A Love Divided shows that this is the real face. The crude way in which Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemonic, Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is a portrayal of history as poor as that of early American westerns portraying the fight between cowboys and American Indians . The truth of history is distorted by stereotypes and the pure and simple flogging of Irish Catholics in history; corruption accepted by the filmmakers themselves! It is unfortunate that people today still think that they can gain moral influence by making a film so easily recognized for its obvious purpose, far from wanting to attempt by art. This film has nothing to do in cinemas and legitimate libraries.
