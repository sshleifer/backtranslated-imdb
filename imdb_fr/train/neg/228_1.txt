I thought it was a movie in New York: fake! It's a bit of the British countryside. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a tragedy ... until the last third, because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word of a French presidential term. That means, almost absurd even if the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What's left? Maybe a good pair of actresses: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a little invisible to me. The great doctoral student surprises by his punch and McDowell plays as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost silent. This sweetness leaves me perplexed because, like other artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. In his case, it's like, whatever the film, it's always the same character defined by his feelings, his values, who lives an infinity of different stories. I still do not know how to define the limit (or fusion) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this film is its feminine touch and its different interesting points of view. Women each have their own way of life, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to see how one and the same reality can be perceived in all possible ways, just as people do. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is quite visible, but the grand finale cuts the desire for a future vision.
