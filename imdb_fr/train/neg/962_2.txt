It's very likely that if I look at it again, I'm in danger of getting physically sick, the movie is so boring ... unless you believe in the psyche, reincarnation and other interest that it's makes a big deal. The "recycling of souls", they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has already been told many times with such films as "Heaven Can Wait". It has also been done a lot better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least, it's a rather docile film, linguistically. This is pretty much the only redemptive quality of this film.
