I rented this movie after hearing about it not being presented for an Academy Award, but after viewing it, it's easy to understand why. Despite the beauty of the photos, the film moves incredibly slowly, despite the fact that it has almost no plot. <br /> <br /> The plot tells the plot of a young boy trying to cope with the death of his parents in what may or may not have been the case. was an accident (the movie is never clear about it), and how his grandfather told him fairy tales. Fairy tales contain the only elements of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not really seem to have any interest. <br /> <br /> The first fairy story is about a boy trying to save a life for his dying girlfriend to save his life, but he is slow to taste the flower to make sure it is not poisonous, which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then states that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that makes no sense because it was an excess of caution and a slowness that led to his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> Skye's photography is beautiful, but Stardust, which came out this year, is another fairytale film shot in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this.
