Let me be clear. I used IMDb for years. But it is only today that I had the trouble to register on the site, just to give this film the lowest possible rating. I have seen hundreds of movies, some bad, some terrible. Never, however, have I seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, high intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is horribly defended as a princess, but totally amazing as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is still a funny character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood so far, and we should keep it from this way). <BR /> <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Léontine is a brilliant and passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from one beaker to another, shouting names. of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even more stupid. For this, the couple should receive a common prize "Clair Danes", which in a fair world would be awarded for a gratuitous, anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teenagers from literature as children of the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Misérables). <br /> <br /> In addition to the atrocious intrigue and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are times when a handful of spectators are immersed in the observation of the action, sitting on chairs, observing the main characters. The director wants us to realize that she adapted a play. I understood. But that does not happen until the beginning of the film. At this point, seeing a crowd of people sitting on chairs for a moment, then disappearing is disturbing and distracting. They are like a crowd of scary zombies, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible singers and songs that end this movie, you'll want to wake up your own zombie crowd and kill them all for the serious injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
