Fiction film (the story is based on a story, although it has a "documented by" credit) about a group of scientists going to the Canadian wilderness to find a Bigfoot (they want to capture one and then join it) a trace). device). His lot of scientific mumbo jumbo is mixed up in what is really a dull movie of a group of people wandering in nature. There have been some attempts to create tension and fears, but to be quite honest, nothing else to visit is outside beautiful beautiful shots of nature. This is the perfect definition of a movie exploitation, it promises a lot, a look at Bigfoot, but it is actually very little. Recommended for insomniacs only
