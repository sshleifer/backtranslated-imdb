It was not nice to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on hold and gets a normal job (boring!) Just so his son-in-law can go to film school, but his stepson decides to make a humiliating documentary about the man. A documentary director must point the camera and simply film, not manipulate and comment with captions. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather are obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank look stupid and pathetic. It is rather the most human of the three personalities presented. <br /> <br /> A smear campaign appeared to be a lot smarter and more daring than her. it is true. This left me with a deep dislike for the filmmaker.
