I saw this film at Sundance 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was, even though, from the catalog description, I was excited to see it. Supposedly a "fake documentary" of two high school students making a documentary on life in high school, the film featured a bad acting, a bad staging, a complete lack of endearing characters as they are written and a total collapse. I like good movies on high school, and it's not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and consciously "cool" although they are supposed to be outcasts. You have the general impression that a lot of people are sitting around a movie that is deliberately bad to show to their friends, but that somehow the film has arrived at Sundance. Mystifying.
