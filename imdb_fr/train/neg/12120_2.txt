In what might have been a mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle period of "free-love"), the creators of this film pile up ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and run the tiny cherry on top, fortunately forever. At no time have I felt sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their difficult life without middle-class care, nor for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The plot of the story slowly advances to its predictable and pathetic conclusion and the only interesting and observable thing about this film is the impressive Diane Lane topless. Here is a hint: this happens about 30 minutes after the beginning of the movie. Fast forward to this part and skip the rest.
