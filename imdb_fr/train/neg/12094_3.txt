This film claims to be a study of perversion on the characters. Some critics have been led to believe that, because perversion is represented, the film is psychologically profound; In fact, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and superficial, without motivating substance. Why is the main character like she is? You will not know from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
