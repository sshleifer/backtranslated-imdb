I thought they should have called this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed with themselves and think that their life is so important ... Give me a break. Such a casting of white lilies as Glenn Close was the most ethnical character ever, this movie really implored that someone from real come steal it ... casting (I thought he was an albino at first) that is supposed to be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this film is the kind of film that can deceive many people into believing it's worth it because it looks like something more ambitious. Better to fill movie theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious shit ... it must have been a better game because you can not fall off the ground.
