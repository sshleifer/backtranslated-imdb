I will not approach and criticize the theories of RAW. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie offers or is well done, not a philosophy of debate on the site. <br /> <br /> That said, this video is really blowing. It's a talking whim of RAW after another. Part is an archive video, so you can see how it has aged over the years, and it's pretty cool. But, otherwise, viewing is pitilessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison, but I was still thinking of Sunday afternoon when I watched Barbra Streisand's star vehicle * Funny Lady * movie). After a while, I was so tired of Barbra that I wanted there to be a scene in which she would not appear: you know, a "Meanwhile, other characters in the movie were preparing something else. ." moment. But everything was about Barbra. Well this video is * Funny Lady * from RAW. <br /> <br /> So, if your idea of ​​the good time is to look at several shots and angles of RAW's face as he argues with his theories, assembled in a lame structure that adds no interest or insight, so be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
