Strictly a routine, Western digits (led by Andrew V. McLaglen-like leader, is not it amazing?). Army Colonel Brian Keith trains with the evil bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped his wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his place after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Hand fights, shots on goal, steal flights and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Keith is talking to a prostitute (a shock after she's been on the "Family Affair" on TV), but otherwise, this low-rent material is wasting her lovable talent. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice it. Direction of hacking, bad writing and several funny little lowball humor attempts. * from ****
