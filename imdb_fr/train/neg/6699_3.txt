"Algie, the miner" is a silent comedy, bad and not funny. The timing of the slapstick is completely off. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they are supposed to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the movie is unimportant. This is a mandatory viewing for moviegoers, mainly because it is one of the first examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an effeminate guy, who looks a lot like the stereotypical "pansy" common to many early movies. The film has the homophobic attitude of the time. "Algie, the miner" is quite horrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
