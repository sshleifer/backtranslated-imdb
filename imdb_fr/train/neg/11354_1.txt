Having also endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, I think it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I now want to explain to my children that Russia is not "the bad guys". Moreover, these rude Russian names such as "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The grandfather Fly's birthday party scene contained an almost sexist joke in which he implied that men drink beer and that women chat on the phone. Two other flies also needlessly use the word "shit" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The film as a whole contains much of the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s, for which I thought we, as a country, were proud to be passed over. <All in all, it's just brutal, badly animated, even worse written and not worth wasting time watching.
