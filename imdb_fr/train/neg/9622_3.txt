When I saw that this movie was on television, I was really looking forward to seeing it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like everyone who grew up at that time, I saw all the movies from the 80s on teenagers and summer camps. So I can not wait to see this film that completely distorts this kind of film. What a desappointment!! The movie was nothing more than a bunch of really vicious jokes and gags, without much intrigue or substance. And the filmmakers' attempts at black humor have totally failed. Some of these so-called jokes did not seem to be just cruel and offensive. The only advantages of this movie were the wardrobe, the music and the acting. It was nice to take a nostalgic trip and see all the summer clothing styles of the 80s, and the same goes for music. And the acting was top notch: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they did not have the best equipment to work with.
