Although the title of this film includes flying guillotines, it has no connection with the original flying guillotines (1975) and its sequel, Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of the kung-fu film and remain a classic. It's a much inferior copy of the original, and even as ordinary kung-fu film, it's below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie does not have a lot of acting. It's an insane fight scene after another, and the flying guillotine does not even play a major role. The story is about Shaolin monks tracking down villains who took off with a sacred book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince intends to attract the monks and use them with flying guillotines. <br /> <br /> There are four films whose title is "Flying Guillotine". This in my opinion is of lower quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film is different from that of the other three, which indicates that this film was produced by a different entity than the other three. <br /> <br /> bad production. <br /> <br /> It's best to skip this and look at the two originals.
