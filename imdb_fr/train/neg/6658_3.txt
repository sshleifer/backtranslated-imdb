There are some qualities that redeem this show. The first is that the melody of the theme has a decent melody. The show has a beautiful premise. Also, I'm probably in the minority, but I like Wanda. I like the fact that she cares and that she is more of a maternal figure for Timmy. However, despite everything, I do not like this show, it is not about feces, but I find it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I would not say it's the best animated show on planet Earth. When I use this term for an animated television show, I think of Peter Pan and the Pirates, I think of Darkwing Duck, Scooby Doo and Talespin. And I hope I'm not the only one who really likes the Wild Thornberry and feels the fact that he's making fun of me. I also do not think Fairly Odd Parents is the worst animated show on planet Earth. I admit it's annoying, and in some ways overvalued, but it's not the worst show on Nickolodean. This is Chalk Zone, god the show is unassailable. But the worst animation show I've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a grossly animated clue, not very funny and downright ashamed. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not like in this show is the animation. The characters, forgive me if I offend, have very strange facial features, and most of the backgrounds are dull and do not have the color that makes Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberry as pleasant to watch. The characters, with the exception of Wanda, are very annoying. I can not believe a talented dubber like Tara Strong (aka Charendoff) said Timmy. Timmy, I do not find the main character very friendly, he's boring and sometimes condescending, and he's also a bad decision maker. And his voice annoys me. In fact, I like Strong but not in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, the supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes are as insignificant as they could be. They are either a) artificial or b) too familiar. Timmy's parents are awful characters, who make fun of their son and who have a lean personality. <br /> <br /> The story is very original, and I keep thinking, where I've seen it before. The episodes that followed the arrival of the baby seemed unassailable to me. The scenario is even worse, very funny, childish, unintelligent and totally devoid of energy. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not the worst show of all time, but it is quite mediocre for a fan of animation and quite uncomfortable. sit across. 3/10 - there are redemptive qualities, and I totally understand if people like it.
