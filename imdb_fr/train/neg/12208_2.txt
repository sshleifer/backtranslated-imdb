As a veteran of the army, this film deeply offended me. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who fought during the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this shit is a euphemism. If the film had been presented as a satire or even a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But this has been taken seriously by my many people, especially abroad. As stupid as it may seem, wherever I went to Europe in the late '80s, people seemed to judge me and the Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A muscular monosyllabic moron is detached from a gang of prisoners to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to free American prisoners of war. In an ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never misses ammunition and never overheats. And he never fails to run with a 32lb rifle raised from one arm. I could go on, but my head hurts. I gave it a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than Rambo III.
