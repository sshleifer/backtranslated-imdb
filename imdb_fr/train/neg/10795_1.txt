Would anyone tell Shaq to stick to what he's good at in basketball? This movie was not even entertaining at a stupid level. In this film, Shaq plays a genius who lives in a basic box is what is not an original genius in a basic box instead of a lamp. He is supposed to help a little boy played by the French cappra, just as annoying. This film had the most fragile story since the aquatic world, the acting was awful and I think anyone who loves this flim would be afraid to admit it.
