"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games, a series of adventure games about the paranormal writer / inspector Gabriel Knight. Prince James of Albany asked Gabriel and his mate, Grace, to investigate a series of mysterious attacks perpetrated by so-called "nocturnal visitors". When Prince James' son is kidnapped, Gabriel chases visitors at night to Rennes-le-Ch창teau, where he begins to reconstruct a mystery of the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite marketing, this game is not about vampires. . Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but never command the center of the stage, such as voodoo hounfor in "Sins of the Pathers" or werewolves in "The Beast Within". Gabriel and Grace do not try to discover the true nature of vampires, nor to research the tradition of vampires. Although vampires murder three people during the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight verses were in the relationships that Gabriel tied with the bad guys. Thanks to these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and he was thus transformed into a human being and less than a monster. However, in "Blood of the Sacred", Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single cheese interview, which does nothing to make the villain endearing the player. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gabriel and Grace in this mystery are rather futile. Gabriel spends his time digging through the identity of members of a group of treasure hunters staying at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing more than a red trap. Grace spends her time searching for the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexed ally who has known for centuries the answer to this mystery. <br /> <br /> The actions of this perplexed ally and his polar opposite - the vampire leader - are unbearable. The ally reveals allusions to the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch창teau and expects Grace (and not the other treasure hunters of the group) to find them. However, he could have revealed the whole mystery to Grace from the first day, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for another 48 hours. And in the end, he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the vampire leader does not achieve the goals of centuries of machination, as he chooses to abstain from action two days after the kidnapping of the child. The only reason given for his decision to delay the action is his willingness to savor his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been better if it had focused solely on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and the vampires should have been omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican to uncover the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. Since Gabriel is described more than once as a Catholic reluctantly, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> In the end, the game was a disappointing episode of the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight's voice.
