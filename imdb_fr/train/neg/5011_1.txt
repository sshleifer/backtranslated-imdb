... and I never thought a movie deserves a 1! But this one is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. My wife picked it up because of the casting, but the scenario, from the DVD box, seemed pretty predictable. This is not a mystery, nor a film about young people. It does not include any sensuality, if that's what the title could suggest remotely to any of you. This is just a total no-no. Do not waste your time and money unless you want to watch a group of young people in an adult Gothic setting, where a murderer will pursue them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makowski is the worst of Nick Stahl.
