I mean really. This will not help the Australian film industry to make this type of film worthless. Okay, if you are a stoner and have nothing better to do, then maybe. I think filmmakers here should try to show the rest of the world what talent we have, and it's not the vehicle for them. Go now, this movie is just ugly.
