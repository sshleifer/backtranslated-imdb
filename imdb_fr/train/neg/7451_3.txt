Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It starts interesting, but he loses his way a few minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> This does not help much that none of the usual big players (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) offers a very good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be because I saw a dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was particularly wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover is not really a bad guy credible. Moreover, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story (save save the life of a main character at a given moment, but this scene is as necessary as a wiper on a submarine; ) <br /> <br /> Speaking of useless scenes - the main criticism is actually the tangled and sown scenario: the detective (of course!) must settle a personal case with the villain and is (of course! ) Suspended from his official duties with the permission of his personal entanglement. The killer (of course!) * Wants * to be found and plays a game of cat-and-mouse with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies rely on a similar scenario - most of 'between them are better, However, <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes and many scenes totally unbelievable and useless that do not contribute or do not work at all with the plot (eg the scene from the truck stop or the car to the edge of the cliff, etc..) <br /> <br /> To top it off, the end is trying to be original and exciting, but completely fails in this regard. We have seen * many * finals with a similar type of ultimate configuration of the ultimate battle on a train in an abandoned winter landscape ... In the end, there is the supposedly moving meeting of a parent and a child. ... hokey, at least.
