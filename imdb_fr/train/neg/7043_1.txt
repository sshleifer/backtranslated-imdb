I was ready to laugh all through this movie, like a mystery science theater experience, but it was boring. It seems that the producers had many biker friends and decided to make a film casually. <br /> <br /> It's often impossible to watch. Many biker sequences on a dirt road, with the same music played over and over. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon would probably have animated things. Maybe she had other commitments on the day of the screening of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikers terrorize a small town. Fighting, murder, cowardly policeman, clumsy mechanic, etc. One biker always wears a football helmet, which is a weak attempt to distinguish him from other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. A scene shows a biker attacking a woman, shouting in her face, "You're all the same, you're all the same!" We return to the scene a minute later and he declares again "You are all the same!" Could not the author think of something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys killed the bad guys. We also learn that the marriage between mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still happening (but with a different wife). End.
