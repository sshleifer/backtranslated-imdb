When the film started, I was shocked to see that it was filmed using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than a homemade movie. Even movies directly on DVD should have better production values ​​than that! Heck, a large percentage of personal videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, the film seems to be seriously realized by sticking the camera on a tripod and lighting it - without a camera! Close-ups and everything that looks like camera work are missing in some scenes where they could have worked and in others, there are too many or too few badly framed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gay men who want to get married. As if it had been done almost ten years ago, their only option was to get married in Vermont - the times have definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of same-sex marriage can in no way be attributed to this film. Supporters of same-sex marriage have been reinstated instead of helping while the film stinks and never really tries to solve the problem seriously. According to the film, religious are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles everywhere and shoot people, as well as the wives of homosexual husbands. I'm glad it gives an honest chance to both sides of the issue! <br /> <br /> Bottom line - nothing in the film shows professionalism and I even hesitate to call it a movie. This is more like a movie at home and does not even deserve a listing on IMDb or even inclusion on the list of the 100 lowest rated movies of all time by IMDb. The acting is awful, the writing is awful, the direction (if any) is horrible, the work of the camera is horrible and the plot is horrible. It's a movie at home !! I can not say anything positive about it, except that Ed Wood's films look like Oscar contenders and I'm sure Mr. Wood's ghost smiles every time someone looks at this mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care if you're gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how they managed to create DVDs. I guess one of the actors burns them on his computer at home during his free time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word "bad"! <br /> <br /> Moreover, if the only lady of the film was a real lawyer, the ability to read would not it be a prerequisite ?! I say simply. <br /> <br /> Finally, since gay marriage is such a serious and important subject, can not we have a better film than EC that addresses the issue ?! This one, unfortunately, only invites to laugh.
