The writers and producers of this small outing plunged into new depths of depravity. Did the writer get stuck so bad OR had such dry ideas that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecated on the back seat of a van, and then quickly threw away the feces on the car behind you at least that sums up what this movie is worth). We had already treated one of the other women who were urinating under the arms of one of her friends, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have been enough ... we got the message! It really takes toilet humor to another level! If the scenario and the game had been better, I could have easily forgotten that I was watching a movie shot entirely on low budget video. It was a rather original scenario, with an intelligent trick (the only one) in that we could never take the point of view of the interior of the van; making it so much more real. We never had the chance to see inside other places, such as the shop or the land where several women disappeared, which could have added a much needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Lines like: "I do not feel well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was chased by a psychopath; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and fired, seems a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was diabolical (except the maniac). Did the 5 main actresses of this region learn to play by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire movie with the subtitles turned on. <br /> <br /> The director seemed to have the easy task. It seems that the only direction he had to give was "Shout the girls". <br /> <br /> AND AS REGARDS SCREENING ...... If you look at this, make sure you have paracetamol on hand!
