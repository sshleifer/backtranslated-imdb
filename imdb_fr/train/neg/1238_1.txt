This remake by Tim Burton of the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" (and featuring Charleton Heston) is far from the quality and intrigue of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the special effects have improved since 1968, but the writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was awful. I sat around the whole movie with a friend (who, thankfully, only rented it) and I fully understood why, before Christmas, all of Target's "Planet of the Apes" toys were in the bin. customs clearance. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: do not put that on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to all others: watch the original 1968 film "The Planet of the Apes".
