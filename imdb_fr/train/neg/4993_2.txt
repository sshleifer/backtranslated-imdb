I went to see this film while waiting for a "really big" action movie, but I'm still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a little action with a touch of comedy. This allows you to stay hooked during the first half, until you expect the time has come for the action to begin. Well, nothing like that happens. The film hangs in length and the end of the film disgusts you to a point that annoys you. Had no sense watsoever. The film was missing from every point of view, had no real scenario and seemed very hollow, even if "Rambo" was included, I do not think he could have helped the ranking. There is simply no logic in the film. An ideal way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating film I have ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view after having endured it. Certainly not for people who have a little sense of cinema in them.
