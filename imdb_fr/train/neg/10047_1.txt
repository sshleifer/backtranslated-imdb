I have now written reviews for several episodes of MoH, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned at the time of the passage of credits. If you are looking at things that people never see in real life are having fun ("let's check the basement!"), Then this is your show. Except that it is neither amusing nor entertaining, but simply annoying. <br /> <br /> The extent of the virus has never been demonstrated. I can really forget the fact that it only concerns men, because the resulting situation is extremely frightening. But then, things get worse as her daughter lets a father evade disturbed at home and finally dies in his hands. The woman flees to the north and faces a few dozen situations. Then a kind of spirit or extraterrestrial or something appears and saves it (things that push you to go HUH?). Or something. Then she snuggles in the heat. The end. <br /> <br /> Awful. These administrators send this tripe by mail.
