Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel to the hit. Yet this TV movie was finally shot with too much melodrama and just does not know when to stop. The troubled artist Meg Tilly is suddenly employed by the rich and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a painted mural on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last rally held there - the release night of Ellen - Tilly 's daughter decides her artistic theme, never dreaming that her daughter dies mysteriously even before the ceremony begins! Two gorgeous actresses lend their services to an incredible thread that does not stand up to scrutiny, which does not match any of the emotionally intense women. Burstyn's role wobbles at the camp, while Tilly is stuck in the dream routine. Only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the end of the mural) is charged with honesty, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
