The roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by threatening guys as they shop one day and are taken back to a secluded island where the girls reluctantly tell that they visited the thugs the last time when they were ten years old and a fortune. All of that makes you think about a movie that's pretty much a long flashback about the girls' first visit to the island and the ensuing fight with a cannibalistic family. <br /> <br /> This one is extremely horribly played by all the people involved at Hank Worden, who really deserved MUCH better. Even though I did not like "Barracuda" (it's on the same DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of tits (they may belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: old ads for various foods delivered by car; and trailers for "Bonnie's Kids", "Centerfold Girls", "Part Time Woman" (nudity features), "Psychic Killer", and "Eaten Live". The DVD also comes with "Barracuda" from 1978
