It's one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. John Carradine has very little time before him. All the characters are boring and the story is horrible. In addition, I could see the two twists in the end arrive miles! The beautiful setting and the terrifying house would certainly have helped if it was not so boring, and there was not a single character on which to base, nor hope, but I hope it will go until 100, because it deserves to be there. In my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, the scene is pretty good, but it's already too late. The only other time he had on the screen was in flashback, and the only really bloody scene of the movie is when a character takes his face. bored by Bee's because it was pretty bloody. I got it in a set of horror DVDs called Back From The Grave and everyone is overexploited in my opinion. In addition, it is lucky that it was included in a set that I bought, otherwise I would have thrown it out of the window! It's one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. It's really horrible, John Carradine has very little time in front of the screen and I told him to avoid it like the plague! You do not want to be tortured. The management is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson is an absolutely terrible! my job here, making everything seem cheap, wasting all of its potential to create a frightening atmosphere and keep the film at an incredibly boring pace. The game is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but other than that, he's barely in the movie, apart from flashback scenes. (Carradine ruled !!). Merry Anders exaggerates terribly here as Laura, because she did not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is fine, and a little scary, but also too agitated, she still had a scary smile in the end. For the rest of the cast, I did not pay enough attention too, I had a lot of trouble crossing it, but they were all really bad. Overall, avoid that, it's not worth it! BOMB on 5
