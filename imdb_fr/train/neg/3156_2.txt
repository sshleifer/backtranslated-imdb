I just want to clarify one thing: I like Michael Vartan! But this movie really lets him down. His acting is always superb, he is always charming and he always looks great. But the film itself is a load of waste! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say, comes a little manly ... you're constantly waiting for her to run away with her best friend, whose sub-scenario is a bit strange. My family (who sat down and watched the movie with me) was also put off by the film's soundtrack; sometimes, the music did not match what was happening in the scenes. However, even that was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the main lady the finesse, the weird characters that were thrown into the fray and the mediocre choice of musical accompaniment, but who chose to cut the entire central part of the film and go straight to the end ?? ? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but the way we get there is left nameless. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy a poster instead.
