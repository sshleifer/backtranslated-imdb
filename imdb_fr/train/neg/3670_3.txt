For a scare science movie to work properly, it must be either truly original or very faithful. This film is neither one nor the other. Of course, there is a pseudo-original twist in the fact that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of an illness, but it's a very minor twist. There is the government's conspiracy angle, the protagonist of the Crusader who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And one of the real disadvantages of this film is that the tainted man has no pathos. Although the character was designed to be a person to be pitied, he is not. Without pity, the film is useless. The other characters are so seductive that they are ridiculous. Secondary intrigues are complicated and annoying. And the sad thing is that the film is too flat for us to enjoy. Make the movie a 45-minute short film and it might be interesting to watch.
