OK, I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go see most things, now that the multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember old single-screen cinemas "chips" and I'm the healthy side of 40). In England, this film came out under the name of "Liar", it's a dog. This is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for the photo and set only.
