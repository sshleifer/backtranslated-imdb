This movie was so bad that I could not sit without doing anything else. There was no plot and no point. I was bored a lot and for a movie about a comedian, I did not remember a joke or a fun phrase worthy of the description. Politicians without technical jargon speaking of charisma could not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how was that done? Is there no quality control in the film? Watching girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in good comedies, was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny at all in this film, so it proves that writing is so essential in an effective comedy.
