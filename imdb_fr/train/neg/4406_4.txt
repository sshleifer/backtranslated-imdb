David Warbeck is an Italian reporter from Miami, chosen by the ghosts of the population of Atlantis (!) To prevent a perverse businessman (John Ireland, Oscar nominee) from using a telepathic fetus grown. using the spores of an asteroid to rule the world. Do you have all this? Despite such a plot, it is really a nuisance and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS despise it with contempt. Honestly, the most creative thing (intentionally) about this film is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's theme, the movie "BEVERLY HILLS COP", for the first titles. The most unintentionally creative part involves a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown twice in a row. Director Alberto De Martino may have wanted to introduce us to the avant-garde at the twilight of his career? I was going to declare the worst Irish film on his resume, but then I saw that SATAN's CHEERLEADERS were there. I would also like to safely declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a dual feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
