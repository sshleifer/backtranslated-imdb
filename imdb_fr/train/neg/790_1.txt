Here is what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The manager of BBC3 must create programs for a different audience of BBC1 and BBC2 to keep his license and his work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry unsunny up. <br /> <br /> 3) The head of the BBC3 takes them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, it's racist, as all characters play up bad stereotypes. If a white person did this kind of thing, there would be some heckling! <br /> <br /> A basket.
