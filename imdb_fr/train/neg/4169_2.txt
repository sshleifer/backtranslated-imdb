I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as Quintana vampireess) looks so sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little logic in this film, but most sci-fi vampires are too. movies. The movie has probably tried too much to break with the stories of traditional vampires. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of gore and scam scenes that made me sick. A good vampire movie should make more sense that you do not need to see a lot of blood - we all know that when a vampire jumps on a human, he / she will do what a vampire will do. Just a few moans or cries to describe the scene (like the one in Quintana trying to sexually awaken Rosa, just a few moans, the rest of your imagination). In any case, it's just my personal taste.
