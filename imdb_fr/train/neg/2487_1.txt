Take "Rambo", mix a few "Miami Vice", divide the budget to about 80%, and you have something that a few ten year old boys could propose if they have a large back yard and too much access to " Penthouse ". The cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as tough as he came) is recruited to retrieve an American supertank that was stolen and stashed in Mexico. Captured with the tank, Sgt. The former love of Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain, Devon (Fluegel), the Chief Officer and now the meat for depraved terrorists / spies / drug dealers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and little sex. The joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently, the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor did he think to give McBain a pretense of intelligence. Even for a budget actor, the production values ​​are poor, with distant shots during the dialogue and very little movement. The main propeller, the tank, is stupid enough for Ed Wood's production. Fluegel, who could have been a blonde Julia Roberts (her role in "Crime Story" is far more important than Julia's!) Must stop shaking to become scared and kick in the feet and come back at any time. Jones, who has taken part in an astonishing selection of films, is almost in the background here. Busey and he had probably come out for easy money and some laughter. Look for the talented actor of future character Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once upon a time in Mexico") in a stereotypical and threatening part. Although too boring, even for guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is noisy enough for you to play when you leave your home, but you want people to think there is someone at home.
