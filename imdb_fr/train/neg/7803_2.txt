"The Secretary" is one of those tacky "thrillers", clich√©s, that one is subjected to surveillance on a Sunday afternoon, while there is practically nothing else. If the plot (a mad woman becomes jealous of all those who succeed in the office and decides to do everything in her power to prevent them) is perhaps unique, I have recognized innumerable twists, probably from other TV shows had been submitted for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not crazy about distribution. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in so many TV movies as a "mother" or some kind of "victim" of a criminal act or abuse, that one has to wonder what kind of life she leads. In this one, she has the joy of playing a mother AND a victim of the psycho secretary, Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has made good career choices (Singles, Breaking In and Law and Order, I suppose, Law and Order), she's also beset by a series of pitiful TV movie roles, and this one is just add to that. As for the others, I do not have clear memories, so it must say something. <br /> <br /> This one will play on the network for life (I think that's where I saw it), but do not bother to watch it, unless you're bored too much for words. Not that it will make you more excited ...
