This fragment of fecal matter brings together so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end, it's a laugh of absolute hilarity. Too bad, because the premise is promising (as often happens at Duhllywood), but in the hands of this writer, he gets lost in the earth. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in jail serving a drunken driving sentence that killed his mistress. We see him having nightmares so that we know he feels really bad about it. Then his cell neighbor hangs himself. Or does it? Lowe has suspicions but drops them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the wicked have nothing to fear. So why did they then prepare to be killed? Ah, that's where this story could become interesting. This is where it falls off the rails and once the rails stopped, he decides that he can get away by insulting the attention of viewers for the next hour of numbness. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* **** <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with an endless narrative of the irrationality of the following, but contemplate this end. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on a train. They want a band he has, because this band is going to screw their boss, and them. So, in the train, 3 cops, unsheathed rifles, are ready to save Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops, in front of half of the passengers, and then ... continue chasing Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! kill 3 cops in public will plunge you into a deep doodo, to hell with the tape. Still, they go through a mall to film the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end, Lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the band !!!
