Norma Shearer, in her forties, plays in this forgotten trifle a flirt, a socialite girl in Monte Carlo, caught in a showdown between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film on the dull and talkative scenario or on the director George Cukor, who never seems interested in enlivening the comatose state of the film. Most of the time, it's Shearer's fault herself, who desperately wanted to continue playing "young" roles as long as she could get away with it. Inadvertently, this makes "Her Cardboard Lover" a strange monument to the vanity of an aging woman.
