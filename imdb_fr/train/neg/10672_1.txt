He had all the clich√©s of movies of this type and no substance. The plot came to nothing and at the end of the film, I felt like a sucker. The production was good; however, the script and the acting were B-movie quality. The cast was mediocre because there were good actors mixed with crumby actors. Good actors do not keep the road and do not lift others. <br /> <br /> This film does not deserve more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for crazy entertainment, I would not recommend this movie.
