I can not believe that some people really like that. Still, they are still called Batman fans. Even going so far as to say that it's better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be a plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of shit. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The goal of the series is "If you can not defeat someone, get a more powerful weapon to help you". Batman is not just about guns. He uses his batarang and grapple and Batmobile, that's all. He does not offer ingenious new technologies every time he can not beat someone. I do not know where they got the idea of ​​a Batbot. or whatever. They ruined all the bad guys. Mr. Freeze went from a friendly scientist to a small criminal who fell into a cryogenic freezing case. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman wearing a dumb costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50-foot top hat. The ventriloquist is now called Scarface, making the model the centerpiece of the character. They even had a silly idea of ​​making him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are those of The Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler into a retro teenager monster. and the Joker to an acrobat with dreads. He looks like a marley wannabe bob. they completely and completely ruined batman even more than B & R! I wish I could meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show to be able to hit the head with a metal baseball bat.
