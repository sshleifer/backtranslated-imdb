I saw bad movies but it took p ***. That makes no sense, and all the characters swear every two seconds, oh and I think we have a low sperm count. Its good. A Welsh plays an insipid cockney. A classy English guy plays an impassable thug in the mouth, and some small lights play tarts. <br /> <br /> And there are Russian gangsters. Oh yes, someone has a gun and may be talking garbage while he's drugged. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
