I was very excited to see this film, anticipating a visual tour of the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, containing types of wisdom like "Rivers and Tides". However, that's not what I received. Instead, I get a rather uninspired film about the fact that human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly an unorthodox statement. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to be in conflict over the aesthetic qualities of his images and the so-called "ethical duty" he has towards the workers to occasionally populate the images along the periphery. And frankly, the images are not usually so impressive. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, a stupid movie. For people who would like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for those who would like to think about the complexity of the problems around them.
