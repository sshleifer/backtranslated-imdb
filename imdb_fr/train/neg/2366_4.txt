I'm a fan of the Nightmare series but this one is horrible. The dead are so fashionable. If you look at it 20 years later, the whole Nintendo scene is outdated. I liked the flashbacks. I think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive. It would have been more interesting. It's a movie you can take or leave. It depends on your free time.
