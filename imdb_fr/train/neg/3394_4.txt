This film presents Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride in Russia, receives Nicole Kidman by mail and gets more than he expected when, surprise, she is not what she is. The story is pretty predictable and Chaplin is undertreating too much to become a little scary. Kidman is pretty good at this role, making his character the only interesting thing in this movie. Rank: C
