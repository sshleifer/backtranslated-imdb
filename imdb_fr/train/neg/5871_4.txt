For me, the only reason to watch this remake was to see how funny and funny it was. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad, because I had seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Will we start? Here we are ... <br /> <br /> Pierre Bezukhov by Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a skinny guy who lacks the depth of the original; Natasha Rostova by Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia; Andrej Bolkonsky of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - an OK incarnation who, like the lean comrade (see above), lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "inner struggle"; Napoleon of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - an unimpressive leader; Robert Dornhelm and Bolkonsky Prince of Brendan Donnison - an English-faced shit; Count Bezukhov of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a show of endless mannequins ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious. They behave like modern European citizens dressed in a one-day masquerade. All this looks cheap and never approaches the standards of our Russian men and women of the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> A good entertainment to watch and make fun of. We had some laughs in our office remembering this modern product, which had been presented the day before on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User Rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I suppose, many young people have never watched our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or have a strange sense of quality "Tarantino-Spielberg". Do you remember the scene where our hussar is rescuing his friend, turning around, shooting and the bridge exploding? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no sense or profession to make a better version of the novel, which has already been properly screened in our country. But I would be happy to watch a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hey directors, wake up and get busy with that, instead of messing up our classics. <br /> <br /> Now, back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is not new, although excessively lethal. <br /> <br /> Making foreign players try to be Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a gross mistake and filmmakers make this mistake. again and again. Of course, it results in many bursts of laughter - especially Clémence Poésy is ridiculously uncomfortable and his dances and songs are reminiscent of a Russian viewer: "It's so bad that it's funny!"). <br /> <br /> To say something New, I would like to mention the rhythm of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very uneven. Narration and scenes are not smooth - they stagger and appear as in a modern video. Again I have to remember our "Voyna i Mir", where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy "going with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought maybe The battle of Borodino would be a good thing (to rehabilitate many disadvantages), but it has nothing to envy to the war scenes filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> After all, there should be something good in this movie. And here. The actors seem to be trying to make everything work. They had no chance from the beginning but they still joined the "losers team". Plus 1 point for this carelessness. This makes the Russian viewer uncomfortable: some scenes are ironically ridiculous, although they are dramatically powerful and the actors do their best. All this evokes pity and sometimes bursts of laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this soap opera is its last part. This shows very clearly how everyone perceives their "salary and taxes". In addition, judging by the trailers, I thought the film would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the entire project. But fortunately, he does not have such garbage. And it's a huge advantage. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not a "Harry Potter" and, even today, even in present-day Russia, we do not have enough talent to film it properly. Shall I say that the moral quality of our life has been immensely degraded? Fortunately, a good movie was screened during the Soviet era. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - ours did not even exist yet. There were then extenuating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 (1 point is given from the beginning, 1 point is for recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the series) Thank you for your attention.
