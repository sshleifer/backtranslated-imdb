Unreasonable effects are generally not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, but it is necessary. The Haunting received the computer treatment courtesy of a once-promising director-turner-director-director (Jan de Bont-Speed), who has since produced a series of high-budget rubbish (Twister, Speed 2). <Br /> <br /> The actors are superfluous in a film of this type and seem to understand it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as they would like to be elsewhere than in this film. Lili Taylor tries to add something to the procedure, but we ignore anything, because the script gives the impression that it is missing half. Events occur, good and bad ghosts occur without rhyme or reason, and then the story ends with a most unsatisfactory non-event intended to conclude the previous 90 minutes of inanity. <br /> <br /> Not even a reason to see this for the effects since we all know that everything can now be displayed on the screen. Why not look at effects in the service of a good story rather than for themselves?
