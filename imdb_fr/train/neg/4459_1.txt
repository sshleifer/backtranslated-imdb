I do not say that because the production values ​​were so low, but because the film was terribly filmed. That girl's blow washing her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for a long shot and watch it do that for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You could hardly see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Have I watched the whole movie? Of course, I did not fail to do that and I do not want anyone to say that I have to look first to be able to judge. This film was so badly done and executed that even with independent and low-budget standards, it's just terrible. A horrible film ... do not waste time unless you want to laugh, but even in this case, it's not because of the "funny" replicas of the actors, but because of the quality of the production .
