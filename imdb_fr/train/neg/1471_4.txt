This kind of movie has become old hat now, is not it? All the nostalgia is syrupy and folded back on itself in a kind of feedback loop. <br /> <br /> This certainly sounds like a good idea: a superb cast, good gags and a human drama about what could have been / could have been. Unfortunately, no central event binds them all, like in "The Big Chill", one of those star movies that gave birth to copied movies like this one. You end up wanting to see more than one or two people in particular instead of making concise decisions about everyone. The superficiality created is not only annoying, it's exasperating. The below-average script does not help.
