This film is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story hardly exists, the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special-FX just makes you laugh. The only thing remarkable about this film is the rapper Coolio's appearance as a police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie was supposed to be a comedy, I did not understand very well. If you want to watch this movie: please drink first and get ready to laugh ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like trashy movies made on the cheap: this movie is a must for you.
