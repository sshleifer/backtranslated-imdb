The first is the highest rating I could have given this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee Yew, a useless mess of a movie with a lot of lost actors doing the best job, written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a twelve-year-old boy who smiles and laughs at stupid puns, and jokes of shit and fart. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat of All in the Family) who tells Marilu Henner's character that she "swings from both sides" is a humble attempt to try humor that reflects the general lameness of the movie ... You want good, shameless humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (first part only), Old School or Office Space.
