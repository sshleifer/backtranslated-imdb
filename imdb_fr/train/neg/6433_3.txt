A hard-to-find film inspired by the still ubiquitous mythology of Senator Joe McCarthy as the political demon king. Boyle (like Joe) gives a convincing but historically inaccurate portrayal of the Wisconsin senator, the caricature that McCarthy often sees as the real one. Meredith, like army lawyer Joseph Welch, who had foiled McCarthy at the army hearings in 1954, are very good, as always. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were right to be concerned about the appalling security situation in the military, and the 1954 army hearings mingled with the smoke curtain used by the army. to divert the investigation from the security breaches, which the committee was investigating, accusing McCarthy and Cohn of seeking favors for their employee, David Schine, while on duty. <br /> <br /> The film is a resolute polemic, inspired by a determined program, based on the ubiquitous myths that have been passed down for the truth with many people for decades - that the "red fear" was essentially fake and McCarthy, HUAC, etc. were still raging against the bad targets, being nothing but lying, hunting dogs ruining the publicity, trampling on the constitutional rights of innocent, stunned liberals accused of security risks / com munists. <br /> <br /> People who know little about it are always convinced to repeat misinformation about McCarthy and the "red fear" that still reigns today. Clooney's Murrow hagiography is an example. Misinformation is omnipresent, it is not surprising that people have swallowed it. A recent obituary by Budd Schulberg in the British newspaper "The Guardian" revealed that the Hollywood writer "gave his name" to "McCarthy" - perpetuating the lie that McCarthy "investigated" Hollywood as head of the HUAC. In truth, McCarthy has never been a member of HUAC and has little interest in Hollywood-style politics. His investigations were confined almost exclusively to the arms of the United States Government. <br /> <br /> The mythology that the "red fear" is unfounded is now completely destroyed by documents recently published by the Soviet and American governments, if something is underestimated by McCarthy and the magnitude itself Soviet infiltration and its traveling companions in the United States, but decades of public misinformation over this period will be difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> One day, perhaps a truly brave Hollywood soul will make a film that will tell the truth about the number of American men and women helping clandestinely the Stalin mass murderer and working to impose his perverse system of government I may talk about Joe McCarthy's career in the Western world, but I will not hold my breath. Until then, we have this mythical and drunkard of popular imagination so familiar in the media ... "Tail Gunner Joe".
