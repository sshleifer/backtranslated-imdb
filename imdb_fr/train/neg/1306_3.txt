(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Designed for Italian television although shot in English, it was never designed to be a continuation of previous DEMONS movies. He was supposed to simply wear the title, THE OGRE, this is how the director Lamberto Bava published it. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of being a little girl going to the old wine cellar of this villa and meeting this cocoon-like structure suspended from the ceiling. It shines and is covered with spider webs and has what looks like hanging spider or insect legs. It drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe it. The villa is just old and crack and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like a kind of 16th century costume with what It looks like a wolf's head attached to it and attracted by the smell of orchids . <br /> <br /> The movies are not so bad and at least the dialogue is half intelligent without the ridiculous and clumsy phrases that dubbing would bring. There is no real coolness, except for some skeletons that rot in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself simply disappears after being knocked over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was faulty. The photo went black for a few seconds about half an hour after the movie started. A defect Shriek has corrected since. The supplements include a brief interview with Lamberto Bava in which he explains that this is not a sequel, etc., etc., as well as DVD trailers released. It's pretty standard. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
