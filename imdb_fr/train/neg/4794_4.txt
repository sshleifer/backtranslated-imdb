Why look at this? There is only one reason, it is the greatness of John Saxon. I like his acting. His favorite appearances by him are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1, and 7 as the father of a Nancy cop, Black Christmas as a cop and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop. While digging into the video outlet of my local mall, I came across the Zombie Death House movie and quickly rejected it, but before moving on, I noticed that John Saxon was not just a actor in this movie, but for the first time in my life. heard of a director. It intrigued me (also the $ 9.00 price tag) and me and I had to have it. When I got home, I realized that this film was not up to the other work of Saxon, not even his acting, which may have been confused by the additional pressures of the staging. But it was not only him, the other actors were also nil. It looked like they were all out of a recent porn shoot and they were telling guys now that you really have to do something. The film even has a porn quality from the 80s. I can not, in good faith, recommend this film to casual viewers, but if you are an obsessed 80s fan who missed the culture of that era by being born too late , or a shitty movie fan that this one is for. Also, if you like John Saxon, like me.
