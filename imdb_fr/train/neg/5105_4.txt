I imagine there are some who remember Nicole Eggert since childhood on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles in charge, and who is the boss? You pervert, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. No matter, you will certainly forget it in this supposed comedy about the devouring extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the stranger? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why did not the alien eat it? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the stranger eats his boyfriend and assumes his identity, you must see it in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to look at this basket. Stay for the shower scene and boyfriend and continue for your business.
