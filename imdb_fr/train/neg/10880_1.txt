This is probably the worst film I have ever seen and I have a taste for horrible (and good) movies. He would have (just) managed some kind of teen humor if he had always been ironic - at the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other films, like PLAN NINE DE L'EXTÃ‰RIEUR, manage to be fun while trying (apparently) to be serious. As far as acting is concerned, it seems that they have brought together adolescents who are brain dead and have asked them to add all the production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the older one breaking the ghouls on the bike.
