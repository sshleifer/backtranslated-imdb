Dear Richard, I know we all loved you when making habitat improvements with Tim Allen. But seriously, do not you have anything to do but lame suites at Air Bud? I would have thought Tim might have already given you a role or even become his personal assistant. I know it sounds ironic, but the pay benefits are far more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Tim and instantly think of "Tool Time". You would even more often have roles with Bob Vila. Instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smiling. I know there was not a lot of script, but you could have added it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this film does nothing for the Air Bud range. On the contrary, false puppies who speak are tougher than seeing dogs playing sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know it better than anyone. <br /> <br /> It's an "F" movie.
