This film is very important because it suggested me this consideration: sometimes you may wish to be sick ... sometimes you may wish to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may wish to have Goldfield syndrome .. . like this. I do not remember this boring movie ... and most of all you would not remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler ... Sometimes you can just wish ... to have rented another movie ... <br /> < My vote? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke, it does not exist, Adam Sandler fan ... I want to hope so), save yourself .. Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... perhaps.
