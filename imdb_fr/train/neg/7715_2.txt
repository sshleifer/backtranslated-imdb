Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned up the trash of their minds and imagined the worst comedy comedy and horror Sc-Fi. If there is a role, it is terrible or above. Special effects; make your choice ... very small budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliche thought is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point your finger at the radiation if you need an excuse. The mutant tomatoes are almost the size of a tow truck and are beginning to attack humanity. San Diego is a good place to start. Scientists and a distracted army must find a way to end this glaring threat. The favorite features of this cult are David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
