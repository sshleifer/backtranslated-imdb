Back to the cabin by the lake just .... was lacking. His budget had to be very low, because a good part of the film had to have been filmed with a normal video camera. Thus, in the same scene, you will get video quality shots AND simple shots. It's a very strange mix! I think they should have found a way not to make the effect of "home video"! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you've seen the original CBTL because you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL ... you will not want to see it if you see it first! It will probably sound way too old and dissuade you from worrying about the original.
