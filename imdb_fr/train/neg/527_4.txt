Cast to die in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying, but before leaving, she begins to tell her daughter the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that look and expectations to be a good movie, simply because they have so many great actors and actresses, so it seems to be for something other than the boiler. Not bad as such, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (who give great performances), you expect to more than a tear-shaped story that is little more than a harlequin novel. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cable.
