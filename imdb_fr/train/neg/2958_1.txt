This movie was amazing. It's beyond atrocious. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horrendous movies to watch for their comic value. My friend suggested this one, but looking at it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just to be able to say that I did it, but I was unable to do it. It's so bad. Terrible gags, lame games. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather watch Costener's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of that movie. I think they're trying to fix some of the issues of dinosaur discrimination, but the part of the film that really stands out is that the dinosaur is constantly turning things around with its tail, and then fame about it. It hurts. Look at him if you are a budding masochist, otherwise leave him alone.
