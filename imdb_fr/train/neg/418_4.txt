One might wish that an idea as good as "the invisible man" would work better and be treated more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally, the last 20 minutes of the film are almost as fresh as a crazy science movie from the early 50s. There are some really good moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and the the very idea of ​​an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we are back in the narrow confinement of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of remakes of old movies or TV shows in the last 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it is becoming more and more clear for every film that the idea of ​​putting old classics under the nose of greedy lunatics like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is very bad. It is obvious that money is the key question here: the time and energy spent on the screenplay are far from sufficient and, therefore, "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined by clichés, lousy characters, predictability and lack of depth. . <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that impressed me, aside from special effects, was swearing. When producing this type of film, modern producers are very keen on seeing the children. As a result, language (and sometimes violence and sex) is greatly diminished. When the whole world explodes, good guys go "Oh damn!" and "Oh my God". "Hollow Man" gratefully eliminates this kind of hypocrisy and the characters are free to say what seems most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something that's wrong is to swear - but it makes it more credible if someone swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
