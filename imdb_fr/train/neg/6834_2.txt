Damn, what a movie! ... I said that I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies of all decades, so I decided to start with this one. It was a pretty good choice. I entered this adventure to find lost precious stones and misunderstood masterpieces, but I have not seen anything like it in this pastel-colored mess. I have not really watched a lot of bad movies before, but I feel like it's called "so bad it's good", probably because it's so unintentionally funny! First of all, there are the inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies related to the plot, physical inaccuracies and psychological inaccuracies. These in particular are as crazy as the buttocks of Van Damme inside this blue spandex. The extremely sticky lines also exist and I will not even start talking about some of the hilarious action moves. There is not really a bad mood on the part of everyone involved in this mess of a movie, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, who is a completely stupid character. And, to tell the truth, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing with the twins. He managed to get a different tone and mood in both roles that convinced me. But the film was generally very bad and the sad thing is that it was produced by a big movie studio ... which is now bankrupt.
