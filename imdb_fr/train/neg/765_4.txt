Seriously, what were they thinking? Over the years, the Columbo series has tried new things and moved away from the usual hit formula, but this movie is too much. This film is fundamentally different from any other Columbo film, but the differences are not for the sake of the film. <br /> <br /> The main thing that makes this movie different from any other Columbo film is of course the fact that no murder is committed. The premises of this film are totally different and place the character of Columbo in a totally different environment and situation. In addition, the combination is totally different and more "modernized". <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has already shot in Columbo, which has remained faithful to the usual formula. It is also a strange choice that he was chosen to direct this film. <br /> <br /> The character of Columbo himself also feels very different, perhaps because of the reason why he is placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps his nephew after the disappearance of his wife just after the marriage. The lack of relief and hallmark of Columbo humor does not make this watch a good or pleasing watch either. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the film does not start too badly, but the film begins to become more and more ridiculous with its story as it progresses. It's a stupid thriller writing kidnapping with a story that is starting to get more and more unlikely. It also makes the film more and more unassailable. This is a very uninteresting entry in Columbo that does not know how to entertain its viewers either. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that secondary actors are not the most talented of the moment. . Despite the fact that his character is in a totally different situation and that the film is shot in a totally different style, Peter Falk still resists and his presence saves a little bit this film. Can you imagine how this film would have been without him? I can tell you that it would have been an extremely bad and ridiculous film at a cheap price. <br /> <br /> A strange entrance to Columbo, which could be described as a missed experience to turn away from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
