No plot, shitty acting, and useless gore .... <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear, no suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, so it's done. Some marines are in the desert for a strange and crappy reason and they are stalked by the mutant animals of the first film, which was good and should have been left like that. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money, and the use of unnecessary violence, just like the sequels of "Saw". They know that intrigue is useless, and that the more they can add, the more people will see it. I miss good horror thrillers. Go Hollywood, you can do a lot, a lot better.
