Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, do you have it? This is called a useless prefiguration. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the road) Basket: This is your doll, little girl. You really should not be so careless with your business. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Crackle?? Cart: I think something serious is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What is the ?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! My ex-girl's writing really improved. And look, his missing daughter looks a bit like the girl with the doll. I was accidentally somehow responsible for the murder, in a way. And she has somehow my hair. I wonder if I should torture myself and go get her? Let's see what my friends think of the police station. <br /> <br /> The basketball policeman: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basketball: I think something serious is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What does the bag contain? AHHH. <br /> <br /> The name of the tree: This is not his daughter, however. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Cart: Can you change that? Daughter of the tavern with big trees and trees: Huh? Basket: (crushes a bee). Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> A pretty actress, once promising, sensually pretty, playing a good maid in a tavern: that's good. Honey is not a plant, however. <br /> <br /> (On the lawn) Willow: Oh yes, and I forgot, you're the father, my child, Conan, uh, I mean Rowen. (Yawn.) I could have stayed and have a life with you. But I have not got. I wanted to be the princess of the hive. I mean, too bad. (Nods, wakes up, widens the eyes to the proportions of the animation). Mwah, kiss-kiss. I love you! What were we talking about? Basketball: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Blink. Why. Are. You. Yelling. AT. Me? Is it because I fired your Vicodin? Sniff. Snort. What were we talking about? Cart: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (In the classroom) Rose: What is the man? Twins without appeal, in unison: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Shopping Cart: Stay away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Cart: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> (To the hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh, bother. Stupid old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> (At the Queen Bee Manor) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Was not that the guy that Cher slapped in the face to Moonstruck? (He licks his lips.) Basket: I was going to ask you the same thing. Where is the girl? Sister Summersisle: How are you zooming. Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous "s". Basket: Look for this semi-trailer truck that is heading towards us! Aaaaah! Oh. It does not matter. For God Sake! (Opens another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back to the tavern) Beautiful, stubborn, stubborn tavern: I've tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I've always been wearing a bear costume since last year. <br /> <br /> A tree named: HAHAHA. All the best to roast this curious cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Busty girl: Totally. <br /> <br /> Basket: It's the last straw that broke the camel's back! Take that, girl! (He strikes her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind) Voluptuous Tavern Girl: EEEE! Change your position! Leave the island already and take me with you! Do I have to attack or what? Get out, I say! EEEE! Cart: Take it, girl! (She kicks him in the face, his eyes roll in his head and become cartoons.) Voluptuous Woman: Snore ?? (To Nicolas Cage roast) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basketball's cell phone rings in the middle of the scene of his bear costume, then the call is interrupted. It's like a wireless ad: help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the bullets I fired from the Basketball weapon? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your things, Nick. Hahaha. And your choice of movies. <br /> <br /> All: The drone must die! Basketball: (screaming) Oh, yes, you sluts? Well, roasting me is not going to help your fucking honey! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (darling, do you understand?) Lower that torch and get away from the basket. Honey! Smokey Bear says not to play with matches. Hahaha. What ??? Beware of this semi-truck that rolls! Ahh! Oh. God, these flashbacks of my drug experiment phase in the 70's are getting old! Where is my heroine? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad is about to happen. Can you hear me now? I am ready for my close up. For God Sake! (Six months later) Voluptuous girl in modern slut costume: I told Basket Case to take me with him. <br /> <br /> Young innocent drone: I like helping people. <br /> <br /> Flying Girl: So get me out of my contract for the sequel! I think something bad is about to happen. EEEEE!
