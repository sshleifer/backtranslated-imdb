Tierney is a real tough guy, but this film missed by a normally competent RKO minimizes its impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a dinner at the tenth ceremony. Just count the number of times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow a lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old clich√© that "it only happens in movies" applies here all goes. Then there is the guy who plays the goalkeeper, who seems to have gone astray in a boozy comedy of WC Fields, thus spoiling the threatening atmosphere that emanated. Static, one-piece decors are no help, nor is Feist's obvious lack of director for the material. Then add a final pursuit by car, lacking both imagination and profitability, and the results are rather flat. In fact, the film only goes in the scenes of the station where hardened cops discover the hidden powers of firefighters looking innocent. Too bad that Tieney's career has never really been gelled. I guess that's due in large part to the fact that it's as difficult as being a hard man off the screen and getting involved. His icy way and the clarity of his emotions remind me sometimes Lee Marvin at his best badass. Anyway, this project could have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising black title, it's a disappointment.
