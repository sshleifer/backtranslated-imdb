The only thing that often comes to mind as I write this article is that I will never have this hour and a half back !!! to indicate that I'm not only blowing air, I'm going to compare the film to the other films in the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube)! cube was not great but it was original and made up for some technical flaws! hypercube as a result lost the advantage of originality, but it came out pretty bright and I even liked it better than cube (the story was better)! but the cube zero compared to its predecessors is not worth it to be missed: a total lack of good special effects, a very f * ck * d up script and simply bad old actors do not combine well! example: all the time during the movie, I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... was to happen and it would happen, so it's not very original either! my advice: do not lose this hour and a half that I lost !!!!!!!! oh and I hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
