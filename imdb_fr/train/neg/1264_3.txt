This film does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because there was a good premise of giant robots fighting against each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film and instead offers a totally bland story that is not very original or intelligently written. Too bad he really tried to be so different from his predecessor, otherwise this movie could have been more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Just like "Robot Jox", it is a B movie but with a big difference, it's just not very good. Perhaps this is also due to the fact that "Robot Jox" was created in the 80s, while the B-series still had a bit of charm and class, although the film was released in 1990. says about this movie. It's just bad, badly done, mediocre and not exciting enough. It also has an end that lets you think 'This is it? That's all? . <br /> <br /> What's missing in the film is a good main story. Perhaps a good bad master would have been a good idea and other items such as a real point in the story, an action or some nice main characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what were they thinking about when they chose the actors for this movie? All are just not friendly in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as a main character, who behaves as if it were a gift of God for the woman and Mr. Perfect who could compete with anyone. Had not they even just managed to get the actors in the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic film, with the concept of great battle droids, the film surely lacks action. If they had put more action into the film, the film would have been at least more fun to watch. Instead, we now have a film that fails to impress fundamentally. <br /> <br /> You can better watch an episode of "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers", for more action and sympathy. <br /> 3/10
