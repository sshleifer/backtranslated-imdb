Since this picture is classified as "pure entertainment" and there are already a lot of comments on it, I would like to address a topic related to humor misuse. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of joker in this film. Certainly, as long as he was involved in the casting, he always acted like a little man: an actor can change his usual outfit but can hardly change his physical appearance. The latter can be an advantage when it is necessary. Although far from what I expected, I saw a very disguised image, purporting to expose different aspects of a baby's life by mistake from a forty-year-old criminal. And with a happy ending ridiculous. So what's the point? Many elements are mixed, the main ones being violence, sex and criminal activities, among which the story is badly composed and, to some extent, devoid of common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is raped and that her husband's life is being pursued? Plus, the diamond is even bigger than the world's # 1 Cullinan! But the most disgusting facet is the continued attempt to make the little man a superman by showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it can not be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the warm blood of a goat. It is no longer a diamond but debris.
