I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate just about everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone says nat and alex wolff are heroes in the world of music and they're going to do things big. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS DO YOU TAKE ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will finish either as hobos or as Jane Hudson in "What Happened to Baby Jane?" I could only go through no less than 20 minutes of it, just 30 seconds from the series and I managed to survive about half an hour from "Battle of the Bands". I have no idea how anyone could cheer these guys on the public at the Kid's Choice Awards. A few days before the film premiere on Nick, most of Nick's teen actresses (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in an ad influencing brain dead children on how awesome nat are and alex wolff. First of all, they did not deceive me, and secondly, nat and alex probably drugged them or gave them a lot of money to be able to say and convince, because I do not see how we could find this show / entertaining film. the music is just horrible. Nat's song is like a sick and dying moose. alex is the most boring movie / TV character of all time. he's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird, he thinks he's sexy and knows everything about girls. this guy is lucky if he manages to get laid. you know that this show is wrong when you discover that some characters (in real life) do not even exist !! the Jesse character is actually played by Nat's cousin and Alex, Jesse Draper (they had to have a budget problem). Their father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the series, which suggests that the Wolff are motherless. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the Naked Brothers are going to be in a deep state when their "fans" will discover that everything is staged. 0/10
