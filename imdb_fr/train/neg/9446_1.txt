An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. A crude and inappropriate humor, scary passages and a sickening anecdote of the mother's boyfriend wanting to send him to the military school to get him out of the way, is totally inappropriate for children who will probably want to see him because of the book (3-8) years. Do not waste your money, time, or good judgment.
