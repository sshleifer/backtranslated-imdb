I really did not really expect this type of movie outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turning it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (which I had already admired before) circulating as a kind of Rambo that saved children was ignorant and insulting to all sexually exploited children in the world. <br /> <br /> What is even more depressing is that the stunning and the depth The movie "Happiness" came out the year before this movie. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments of the most intelligent viewers. They could see the mediocre and ridiculous treatment of this subject. Those of you who think this is a big cinema are displaying a disgusting amount of ignorance and you have to watch "Happiness" to open your mind to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even parent? Hmm ... I wonder. If they want to make a film about international child slavery, whatever the type, they have to make it all realistic and emotionally involving instead of that shit that pushes the buttons. 1/10
