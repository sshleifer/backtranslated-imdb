This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a group of crazy characters on a stupid mission. Its climax is the signature of the entire movie that meets and fights in a crazy moshpit for hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money at Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" at Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not mistake yourself; Even if his films are clich√©s and absurd, I usually end up enjoying comedy. However, in most of his previous films, there was good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are remarkable people). Now, the hilarity of his films fades because he uses the same formula again and again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is irritating and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is fine and Sharman Joshi is the best.
