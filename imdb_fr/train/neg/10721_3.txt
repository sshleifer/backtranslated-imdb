An expedition led by the famous Captain Storm (Mark Dana) goes to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to discover what happened to a previous expedition. They meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves facing a mother who drinks blood ... and only Simira seems to know what is happening. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I caught this on TV late at night when I was about 10 years old. It fell asleep! By seeing him again all these years later, I can see why. It's slow, the mummy does not even show up before 40 minutes (and it's only 66 minutes!), The acting goes from bad (Dana) to really bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to find. This film focuses more on second-rate drama (involving a silly love triangle) than on horror. <br /> <br /> That gives three stars because it looks really good, everyone is playing straight ahead, there's good Diane Brewster acting, it's short and the scenes Mummy attack (the three) are not bad. They are not scary just a little scary. Nevertheless, this film is rather bad. A safe remedy against insomnia.
