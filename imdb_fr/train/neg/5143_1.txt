Even if 99.99% of people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, I will follow English because it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This film is a piece of cr * p. The worst game I've seen in a long time. The children are terrible. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and only one voice, like a 5-year-old reading in front of the class. How can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie? The scenario is so shallow that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It's so simple that you could write it on a towel in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-adolescent; 2) Globo's stupidities have so thoroughly brainwashed that you think that everyone with Globo's seal is awesome; 3) you have severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A shame for the Brazilian film scene.
