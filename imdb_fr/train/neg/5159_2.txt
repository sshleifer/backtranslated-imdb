Watching this movie is like eating a meringue banquet. At first, it looks great but gives NO satisfaction - no. <br /> <br /> The plot is a confusing jumble about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams, the movie still runs so badly ?! This is because the image is all-out, without any substance - just like Williams' terrible image of Popeye at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but perhaps there was not enough money left to hire writers who graduated from primary school. <br /> <br /> The movie is a funny little joke that lasts again and again. I'm really not sure why this was done in the first place - it certainly was not done to provide some kind of entertainment.
