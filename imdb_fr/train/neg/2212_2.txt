The plot of land of this small budget watchmaker includes all the amenities - a mad scientist with a sidekick, the malicious greed of the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering, and information technology ... can not leave it out. <br /> Start with a strange sequence of uncontrollable boaters who are foolishly seeking to swim in the waters near an unknown island and end up being filled by the swarm of hammerhead sharks. .... <br /> <br /> Cut to force back story involving the declining stocks of a generic pharmaceutical company that motivates its nasty Shakespeare citing the CEO to receive an unsolicited bid made by a former employee / scientist who was fired from his position as head of research and who happens to be also a nut ... of course (total Herbert West wannabe). He is proposing a new stem cell technology that could yield a lot of money ... or so, it seems ... That attracts several employees from his island of Moreau-ish (it must have been a pretty impressive release package when he was released to allow him to buy an island) to validate his scientific discoveries, including the CEO and, by the way, the ex-fianc√© of the son of the mad scientist has now turned into sharkuman (what a practice) .... <br /> <The plan is, in a way, to revive the lost love between the former couple and to avenge the former colleague of his dismissal. (Shey, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own island, after all ...). <br /> <br /> Soon, everyone is on the run (because of the countless security guards loaded with heavy weapons, can there be an unknown island without man-eating plants?), from Sharky Son's appetite for carnage, from quack breeding plans, and lack of cellphone signal) ... and they must all learn to work together to get out of the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will someone escape? Will a new species be created? Look at him and discover him. <br /> <br /> This film has an entertainment value, but do not expect much ... for the real fan of Combs, not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
