This film will be a hit with those who love sophomoronic, stupid, explicitly boasting sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like a comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from Whipped. It was so bad that I left after about half an hour. I saw two children who seemed to be about 10 years old - very dangerous - it deserves an X.
