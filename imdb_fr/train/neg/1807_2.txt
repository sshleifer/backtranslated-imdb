I admit that, having reached its majority in the hippie age, I am a sucker for this kind of films. I can appreciate the hippie schlock much more than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply appalling in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> Every ordinary perception of hippie foolishness is presented as a gospel, the cops killing a young hair when it lands on a plane. This film is so horrible that it's not even funny to look like a blunder on the excesses of the hippie drone. It's like a left version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars is because there are some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack. In addition, I could not find a choice for negative stars. <br /> <br /> No actor, almost no plot, sheeze, hardly even a script ... you have it, a movie "art" .... All this is done slowly drilling the root canal, trailing each scene meaningless just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> strange twist of life imitating art, the film's "non-actress" star joined a common in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his co-burglars has was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident" ..... and just think, he must leave this behind him as an inheritance ... Oy vey.
