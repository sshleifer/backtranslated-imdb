T.Z. Post, a university professor, receives a false letter claiming to have inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial means, he withdraws his life savings of $ 4,000 and decides to go out and live at last. After sending his luggage on a train bound for Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe and decides to do so, allowing him to stage a show on Broadway. On the night of the show, poor Professor Post must hide from his creditors, solve the problem of relations between his girlfriend Pansy and diva Eleanor, and ensure that the show continues. After watching a lot of Keaton's silent gems, this one is painful to watch, but I thought it might have been a lot worse. Durante, Todd and Selwyn are very annoying at times, but remain friendly. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as a frustrated show director. 90% of the screenplay is poorly written because MGM is trying to get this film for a film by Marx Bros. of a poor man, in whom many visual gags fall flat from the beginning. Compiled with Keaton's alcohol problems at the time, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Note- 3.
