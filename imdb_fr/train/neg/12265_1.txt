The special effects of this film are, especially regarding its time, laughable and used in such a way that you can not deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The acting game redefines the term "terribly excessive" at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff are redefining the word "bad". <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charm of this The film can be found in two things: the first is the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken in the role of the mysterious Gaunt, a psychic who can feel where and when people will die and is still there. <br /> <br /> The seconds are The original finds, the combination SF-Western are obviously original, but terrible, but other discoveries are more original, as the shooter Zack Stone is able to feel the pain of people who he shoots (although his role is insufficient here). <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not see this film, unless you like this brutal old man, Carel Struycken, as any self-respecting Dutchman should be.
