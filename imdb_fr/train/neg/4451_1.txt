This movie was probably as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Example: <br /> <br /> 1. To simulate drowning, Roberts secretly follows swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death," the YWCA calls her husband to work to offer her condolences. HELLO how did they get his work number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving town, she leaves her wedding ring in the bathroom. Days or weeks later, her husband finds him in the John. Does this mean that toilets have never been flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given about how she pays for her mother's care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her husband RICH). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tedious movie, Roberts suspects her husband of being at home. Instead of running for her life, she runs to the kitchen to see if the cans are stacked well.
