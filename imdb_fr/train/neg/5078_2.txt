If "The Exorcist II: The Heretic" of 1977 does not serve him, it is difficult to imagine what the extraordinary hopeful Richard Burton saw in this dull, no-frills exercise. You've already seen it all: Burton plays a writer who discovered early on that he has the power to move inanimate objects by the force of his mind (and you thought that "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" behaves like recycled products, although the special effects of the end of the cathedral are solid (although typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the support distribution is extremely weak. Burton is tired, but tired ... not even telekinesis could save him at this point. * 1/2 of ****
