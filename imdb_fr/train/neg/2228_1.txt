This film is weak, the box-cover says that it is the hardest gang of the east of Los Angeles and that it is really that of Santa Ana, James Cahill acts like a queen of the cupboards which slaughter all the hard ones from the hard gang of Chlo. It's wrong, boring, insane and crazy, I tried to get my money back in the video store, this movie was so bad. It was also on the homoerotic point far from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill should play in Gay Porno. James is in all scenes, he can not act to save his life. The film stars Eva Longoria who is hot but James can not even score with her !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt that I was watching gay porn and that the whole movie had upset her. James clearly wants to be with men but rather than submitting to his gay desires, he beats gang members again and again. His martial arts skills are at best minimal. Real gang members would take him with his weak skills and tear him a new one.
