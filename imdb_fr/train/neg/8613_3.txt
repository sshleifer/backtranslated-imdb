I almost burst into tears watching this movie. No laughing but memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money did it his best and Back To School is by far a classic 80s masterpiece. Then there were ladybugs and that's where moment that it started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a slight progress for Ladybugs but did not say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives, Rodney plays Monte (a name he must like because he was so called in Easy Money), a rich man (he does not always have) who loves women and get married as if nothing had happened. Well, now he inherits an immense piece of land and since it is run by the Amish, he inherits 5 wives. This seems like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The script is so mediocre that Rodney seems to say that his linings do not go to the camera and that all the secondary characters have nothing to do. It looks like the film was shot on video with some really bad stunt sequences that are obviously not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems to mean the word F (which he should do since the movie is rated R but plays as if it were PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice cameo. 2 minutes. Do not get me wrong, I sometimes laughed at some of Rodney's jokes, but the poor man got way too old and slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles away. And the film turns out too much PC that, thanks to the horrible 1990s, Rodney of the 70s and 80s, does not work anymore.
