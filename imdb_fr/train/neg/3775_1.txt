As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are bold comics. I think that the director was carried away by his "artistic vision" by the look of the film, instead of attracting the necessary attention to the content. Despite its exceptional distribution, the performances are mediocre and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was probably interpreted as a simple waterfall to get a press before its release. A good thing, because his appearance here gave a little credibility to his album "I'm Breathless" (Music inspired by the movie Dick Tracy), which was a stratospheric success is not in, nor has any relationship with this film). I guess most of the money in this movie comes from links to Madonna's album "I'm Breathless". <br /> <br /> If you watch it at home, eventually headlines, you think "there are two hours of my life, I'd like to come back." Save yourself the time lost - do not bother with that.
