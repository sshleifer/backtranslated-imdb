There's really no way around that, Lady Death: the movie is really bad. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well-endowed blonde who runs around hell in a leather bikini with occasional splinters of graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of a cartoon of the years. 1980 based on a line of figurines. The villain himself even speaks as a Skeletor midshipman, has the inept obligatory servant and lives in a den that appears to have been modeled after the villain's field of the old Saturday morning cartoon Blackstar. Do not expect a humor other than the sometimes screaming dialogue. At other times, it's like an anime tale more suited to hentai, but there is no sex, no rape tentacle (thank God!) And very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the main character. This material simply does not benefit adults, unless you count half-naked heroin and bloody dead. What we have here is essentially a long episode of She-Ra, princess of power, but with skimpy clothes and more gore.
