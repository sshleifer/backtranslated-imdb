After seeing and loving Postal (yes, I loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I chose Seed because I stumbled into a local DVD store and c is supposed to be one of his best films. <br /> <br /> While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed to be the beginning of a not too traditional psychological thriller, it quickly broke down from this film and eventually became one of the most I have seen so far generic slasher films, including a huge amount of holes in the plot, unrealistic emotional reactions and poor interpretation. It seems that Boll did his best to come up with a decent plot, but after a while, he just gave up. Maybe he should stick to comedy ?! What's good about this movie is that it manages to create a frightening overall atmosphere, that the special effects are better than expected and that the soundtrack is well suited to the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced pace of this film , combined with its generic nature makes it takes half an hour tedious enough to look at, which has completely ruined my experience. There are shocking scenes very well done, but they seem to be there only for the shock value. And let's not forget the work of the camera which was sometimes quite nauseating. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will know one day what makes a good movie, because between a lot of horrible movies, he seems to look good from time to time. The seed is not part of it.
