SPOILERS: I'm always surprised how many people have given this game good reviews. It was horrible. The script and the voice acting alone have ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unpleasant characters in the game. You almost prayed for their death. And even worse, there are fewer vampires in this game than werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The absence of real vampires was unbelievably disappointing. If you're waiting for some kind of Anne Rice vampire story, forget it. The story of this game has very little to do with vampires. You will not even see them before the end and you will not even be able to fight them. <br /> <br /> History has a radical and rather blasphemous vision of Christianity. I'm surprised he came out of the drawing board. I am not even a Christian and I found it offensive. The story revolves around the search for the Holy Grail and the buried treasure. The kidnapping of a royal baby, which should have been the focus of concern, is really being put aside. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, it almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few blocks of time. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. The characters move with turtle, even on the best systems. They are big and obsolete. And it's hard to switch from The Beast Within JVM to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace is also taking a terrible turn. I really do not know why it was so rushed, but they sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spends most of his time telling his best friend Mosely how he regards Grace as a sister and does not think she is his. And it seems really collapsed that they slept together. But he's so unfriendly throughout the game that you do not care much anymore. His dialogue was the worst of the game. And he was constantly making stupid sexual insinuations to all that was feminine the whole game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him what appears to be a letter to Cher John. I guess she was as fed up with him as most players. <br /> <br /> I found the story boring and boring. I was expecting to play the story of a royal baby kidnapped by vampires. And I was expecting to see and fight the vampires, maybe even Gabriel or Grace become one. But no. Instead, the story focused on the author's distorted vision of Christianity. Too bad. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and we got some. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end. We have some action-style puzzles in the end. But it was not worth the pain all the way through the game. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this game. I had it back when it came out years ago, and I I hated the game engine so much that I left it in abeyance for years. I only recently dusted it off to see what I missed. And now, I'm really sorry for doing it. My favorite characters have been ruined. I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series. And I hope they succeed next time. It would be a terrible shame to finish the series with this payment.
