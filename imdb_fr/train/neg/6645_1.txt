This guy has no idea of ​​cinema. Okay, it seems that he did some interesting plays in his youth, and about two acceptable films that were more politically successful because they cheated communist censorship. All this is fine, but look good: HE IS NOT KNOWING HIS WORK! The scenes are unbalanced, with no proper beginning and and, with messy content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he authorizes himself with violence, nudity and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive a rotten corpse who has never understood anything about the art profession and cinematographic profession? Why do not they let him succumb?
