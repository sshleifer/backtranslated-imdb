I caught "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty lame. The poor lighting and camera work, as well as the poor quality of the editing and the music, make the film seem of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and the rest of the film? the technical production is tied with the FX! You can not simply escape with cool FX shorts, it's been 5 years that "405" caused a sensation. At least this short fast, cool and was even a little funny! None of this can be said about "Lost Pains".
