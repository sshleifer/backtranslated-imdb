Any movie that has nudity scenes from Karen Allen and I'm always so bored that I'm going out, it's a stink! <br /> <br /> Karen finds herself stuck in Paris and befriends a very attractive French girl with whom she has sex soon. Of course, he is married ("But, dear, why would that be a problem?") What could be an interesting crop shock is (believe it or not) just boring. I came out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie improved a lot after I left; but it would have been much better to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this situation, run, do not walk, for the exit. Save your time and energy Surely save your money. It's a shame that the production company did not save money.
