I did not really know what to expect from a Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi genre, but, given the actors involved, I thought I was going to give impetus. The tone of the movie was embarrassing, going through every genre but never feeling quite balanced. I finally stopped trying to focus on cinematography and individual performances, which I found good, considering each character. had little depth because of the nature of the story (do not reveal anything here). I must say that it seemed MUCH longer than its 96 minutes of execution, and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for a conclusion, a measure of satisfaction, but that did not prove to be the ingenious or ingenious element that I had hoped for. I think Tony mistakenly thought that what he did at the end of the film gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to validate the previous 95 minutes with that ill-conceived conclusion. In the end I feel cheated. IMO, it would have been better to leave it without the "end" as a piece of art ... just. Or ... I may have missed the point :)
