The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the end made me laugh. I had high hopes, because I really like the horror films of holidays in the countryside, but that does not correspond to the criteria. It's really a bad attempt to show a character who slowly slips into madness, which, again, is not a bad plot, but hurts here. There are scenes (like the end) that are not meant to be funny, but that made me laugh out loud. On several occasions, I thought the film was going in an interesting direction, but it never fills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
