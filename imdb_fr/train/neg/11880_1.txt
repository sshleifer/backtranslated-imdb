Office work, especially in the age of computers, multifunctional photocopiers, e-mails, voice mail, postal mail and e-mail, is a territory rich in satirical possibilities. Office space "and with great success. Haiku Tunnel, directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, has failed to live up to its predecessors and leaves the laughter behind the door, waiting for an opportunity to sneak. Unfortunately for the public, this chance never comes up; So, what you get is a good try, but as the man once said, no cigar. <br /> <br /> As the narrator / star of the movie, Josh Kornbluth (performer Josh Kornbluth), indicates in the early frames (in a monologue delivered directly to the camera), this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of "San Franc'l'isco". It is an innovative disclaimer, if not presented with a lot of imagination, and not so funny. This is however a harbinger of what will follow, and all this - like the disclaimer - is just not so funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who feeds on his work as "temp." It's a job that suits him and gives him time to take care of his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does too much work on the first day, and Shelby sends Secretary General Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to sue 'L' The idea of ​​working full time for the same company, however, arouses fear in Kornbluth's heart, but he gives in and commits to the job. He is nervous about this, but at least now the other secretaries recognize his presence (which they would of course never do with an interim), and if things get complicated, he has seventeen important letters he has typed - they have to be sent by mail - he holds them back (he holds them back because the mailings are easy, and he needs "something easy to do" in reserve, in case everything becomes too difficult for him ). These are "important" letters, however, and at the end of the week, Kornbluth always has them on his desk. And it does not take a genius to understand that when Shelby will know, Kornbluth's time as a blond-haired boy will be over. And fast. <br /> <br /> The Kornbluth brothers, who have not only directed the film, but also John Bellucci, also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page from the comedy book Ben Stiller where it says ` If you play it right, they will laugh. But they did not do it and the public will not do it. Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) "plays" funny - as in, he "knows" that he is funny - he is never. And that's exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being "funny", it appears as sincere and pretentious, a serious error of judgment on the part of the Kornbluth, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own film. <br /> <br /> In trying to determine exactly why this movie does not work, it boils down to two basic reasons: Achievement, which - if not necessarily "bad" - is at least negligent; and secondly, performances, starting with Josh Kornbluth's. Kornbluth just seems too impressed by himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin - both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively - Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not fit that lens; he seems to need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is actually much smarter than the character of Kornbluth. And being unable to pass that makes him go back, as well as the movie. Rather than giving millions of clerical workers a chance to see someone in this film with whom they can relate or identify with, Kornbluth's attitude is patronizing and serves only to alienate those who he is trying to reach. So all this comes down to a bad actor and a mediocre actor, and when you take into account that the scenario itself was initially weak, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the rich subject's potential), it's easy to understand why this one just does not fly. <br /> <br /> The grace of this film is the performance of Warren Keith in the role of Shelby, whose subtle interpretation is convincing and which - in itself - is quite humorous. Its effectiveness is however diminished to the extent that Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which automatically cancels his positive contribution to the project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads out of the water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not memorable; at least they make their scenes watchable, and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily. But it's still not enough to save the day or the movie. <br /> <br /> Secondary distribution includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk), with the appearance of Harry Shearer, scruffy, in as leader of guidance - a role that calls for an answer to the question: What was he thinking when he accepted that? In any work environment, there will always be situations that, one way or another, will inevitably become fodder for someone's comic cannon, and the movies describing those situations will always be with us ; the good ones (see paragraph 1) can even become classics in their own right. "Haiku Tunnel" will however remain very long among them, because his destiny is elsewhere - in a domain known as "Darkness". I note this one 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
