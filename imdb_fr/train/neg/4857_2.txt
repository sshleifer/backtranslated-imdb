I really liked ZB1. I really did it. I have no problem with very low budget movies, and I liked movies with lower production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, check out 'wiseguys vs zombies' if you're interested ). Indeed, I prefer low budget zombie movies, because I doubt that Hollywood directors do not understand what are zombies. "<br /> <br /> But ZB3 was so bad, it was delayed, I do not want to take the trouble to be worthy of my critics, I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it does not really took only about 80 minutes, because I put it in 1.4X quickly. <br /> <br /> Okay, here are some reviews. <br /> 1. The pace was terrible Everyone spoke in monologues, even when someone had only one line, camera work, editing, and inserting multiple F bombs in each sentence made the FEEL line a monologue At first, I was excited about the 90 minutes of the 70 minutes of ZB1, but there were actually fewer events in ZB3 - it's all about conversation. <br /> <br /> 2 The gore effects have become more stupid, just slip on the belly of people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, there was no real intrigue. is really epic! I will not spoil it, if you go to watch it. (Do not look at him.) But then it's just a group of lame people walking and bickering for about 80 minutes. or less, if you wish.
