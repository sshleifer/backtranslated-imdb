Here is a review for people like me. This film is void from beginning to end. I threw popcorn on the screen and had fun entertaining myself at the MSF2000. The plot is based on chance and relies on stupidity on the part of people supposed to be intelligent. Lead falls for a scammer and it does not occur to her that she could get scammed ????? And she is rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Go. She enters the bar at the most opportune moment when everyone is gathered to talk about threatening her ??? It was so staged that it looked like a slap to the audience, even half-empty. The man of the rain would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise the dialogue with Mamet with the kind of passion that some feel for carnivores, war fighters and fur carriers. My hate is so complete that it defies logic. But I will try it. That it does not seem to be real, that's good. I do not care. It's because everyone is talking the same thing. Mamet can not create characters. all he can do is impose his voice relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confused about everyone being the same character. (However, his latest movies are improving.)
