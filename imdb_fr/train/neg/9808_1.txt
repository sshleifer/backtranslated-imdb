The worst show I have ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have super powers, and when they use a special device, they turn into strange and poorly designed costumes. The acting game when they are not in the costumes with the delayed appearance is decent. It's really not good, but not the worst acting game I've ever seen. However, when they wear their costumes, the acting goes from bad to worse; a lot, much worse. Hyper-animated fools have a myriad of useless movements. Even when they talk, it looks like they have seizures. The bad guys are more stupid than the Rangers. Each episode, a weak and silly villain proposes a plan to destroy the Rangers. He then sends a force of hyper-animated extraterrestrials to attack the rangers. The Rangers then initialize their transformation animation of 10 hours, then annihilate the extraterrestrials. Then, the badly-conceived villain, who can be an armored villain who looks and acts really badly, to a humanoid creature looking like a ladybug with trumpets tied on his back and showing obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the villain, who then turns into Godzilla, either by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot nuclear weapons at creatures and creatures turn into giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and invoking their Zords, which are obviously toys on which the producers of the series have used special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets angry, they all teach a "valuable" lesson and the series ends. That's all. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake fights of kung fu.
