What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well, I watched on a Seattle-Tokyo flight, and as this flight was long and boring, the movie definitely did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost totally implausible even with his takeover at the end. The two hours and more of the movie waste most of the time on the screen with random garbage that only binds the plot as slowly as possible. In the defense of movies, the character of Rosario Dawson adds a little life to the film, but not much. I do not understand how anyone could really cry during this movie when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish, proving that killing himself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
