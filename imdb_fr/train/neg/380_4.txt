I wonder if there is any sense in this film. It's a big joke. Good .. It's entertaining .. You can see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which audience group this film is primarily intended for. <br /> <br />) plays a surrogate mother for a happy couple, Salman / Rani, who wants a child but can not. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real takeoff from the life of a real couple. <br /> <br /> Rani seems happy with another pretty woman in her house who was brought to make a kid for her and Salman. She takes care of Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they have a little romance. When will the public be fed up with Salman's nakhras? <br /> <br /> Although it's a good hobby, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
