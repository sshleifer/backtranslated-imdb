Hello everyone, If you saw "Sing in the rain", you remember the scene where Gene Kelly danced in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make 'em Laugh". If you saw "Royal Wedding", you will remember that Fred Astaire had danced on the ceiling. If you have seen "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the dance number of the title choreographed by the king himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. There could have been some successful dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was "I Can Do That" by Chuck McGowan. the mere fact that talented people move on the stage does not make a good dance film. Richard Attenborough was responsible for this failure. He pointed the camera at the stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Shouting to people who are auditioning for a role in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as bad if he took part in a western or a comedy. He's good when he's in a Michael Douglas movie where you see him screaming after someone you want to scream at. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The distribution was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been done even using the songs from the theatrical production, but someone should have thought about how to film it. <br /> <br /> The next time they do, I hope they'll call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
