This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of bric-a-brac shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment industry. The idea that the public paid to see this film (and like an idiot I rented the film) is also discouraging. <br /> <br /> An obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills a teenager's family because he wants it. Without any reason, he kills the mother, the father and the brother. From the first five minutes you see the wrong game and the wrong direction. Years later, an obsessed teacher escapes from prison. HMM - usual bad writing - no one in the city he terrorized knows until the last minute. An obsessed teacher becomes sort of like a SEAL of the Navy and can sneak around, sniff people and with a knife, he's a great killer. Sure!!! Now, an obsessed professor kills the hotel maid for no reason, drops a knife on the fly for fun, and starts chasing down the teenager's friends. There is now the ideal way for the girl to love you. The obsessed teacher sneaks out of the hotel - again, that's stupid, never would a policeman know his face - but he misses them. Now, he kills two cops in front of the teenager's house and sneaks into his bedroom and kills his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive element about this trash. If another profession performed a job of this poor quality, it would be fired. Yet these idiots earn hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this garbage.
