This movie may have been the biggest disappointment I had in renting movies based on IMDb critics. Overall, I just found it to be a second-rate movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly passable because the anti-hero and Ma Wu treat her character with a playful skill. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so blatantly wrong that I simply could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager in disguise for Halloween, with a $ 4.95 beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were mediocre, even if the "undead" of the cellar were pretty good. The tongue of the tree looked like a bad monster movie of the 1950s, though POV views of the tongue look more like Sam Raimi's branded pictures in the more recent "Evil Dead" trilogy. Pyrotechnics have worked wonders and the final battle is about as boring as possible. (In fact, it reminded me by far the episode "Lost in Space" where the Robinson were caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no twists. In fact, you know right away that you are introduced to characters who are good, who are bad and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just made this movie to Netflix, then I sat down writing this review. The first thing I did was check the production date. Yes, that says 1987 ... not the 1967 that I thought. And that sums up the situation pretty well: production values ​​and currency effects are typical of the 1960s. The plot and the action seem much older, whereas Hollywood produced interesting and stimulating films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** on *****
