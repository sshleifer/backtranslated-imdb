Baldwin really bent down to make such films. The script, the music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound effects do not really sound, they come out too much (technical gadgets, etc.) If they try to make a movie about this stuff, try at least to make it a reality and remove those extra beeps and beeps because these gadgets do not produce such loud sounds. Natural sounds such as footsteps and the like are non-existent, giving it an atmosphere of emptiness. <br /> <br /> The staging seems suitable for a low-budget film (I hope it was a low-budget production), although it sometimes seems quite amateurish. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and wrong, they just did not really interpret this movie. I would imagine that it would have been a better idea to make Spanish speak in Baldwin than to make Spanish speakers speak English, when we all know that their language is more alive and more alive, which is why the actors' performance can suffer greatly if a strange language is used. Finally, could anyone finally realize how stupid it is to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? It would have long been a body buried in film production. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film still manages to portray the European police as lazy and corrupt, societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot still looks like "Interpol can not do anything, then let's call an American to take down this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures follows the same path as Columbia before producing movies for hell. I imagine they respect each other too. Are buyers supposed to buy all dirty titles just because Sony publishes something good several times a year ?! Maybe they should have used the same team that made up Di Que Si - Say I Do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job in keeping the film afloat. Look and look a lot better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
