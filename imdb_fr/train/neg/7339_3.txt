Maya is a woman without any interest. She dreams about her life and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting subject. This would require a good story, a pleasant setting and good dialogues. There are not any. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climax. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. But although I'm a big fan of him, I could not stand this movie. Even if he can not bring out this movie. The movie is not as bad as "King Oncle" and if you're a fan of Art-house or if you like to slow it down, you might like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not surprising. My recommendation: do not look at it.
