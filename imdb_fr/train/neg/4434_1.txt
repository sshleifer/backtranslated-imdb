I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully charming historical piece. What I had was pure waste. This movie was confusing in most places, jerky in almost every place and terrible in all places. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young scholar was at best depressing. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely continue to play Petunia Dursley; at least, Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than what they call a play in a movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography looks like a student who has taken a course on Cinematography 101 and has failed miserably. Almost all scenes in the movie are chopped for some effect. the end result being of course the most mordant editing I have ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; Too bad he had a script so bad to work. Rachael Stirling makes her best efforts as an almost credulous woman waiting. In the end, I really want Blockbuster Video to be repaid. I'm so glad I did not spend $ 10 watching this fiasco at the theater. If they play this piece of Marivaux since the 18th century, I wonder how many people through the ages have had their best naps during this piece. If I had been there, they would not have heard the room about snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can ignore boring or awful scenes. I guess that means I only looked at the beginning and the end!
