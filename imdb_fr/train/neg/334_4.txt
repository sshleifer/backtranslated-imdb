Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of mediocre special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one, for example) and a real time. (Charles Dance) is awful like the bad guy and he's much better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) makes a non-comic joke, and I heard that this chasm had already succeeded, a great success ?? !! I will never understand why or how ?! In a TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for a 2007 Oscar, regretted it in a comical way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... it's the 1980s!). Well, no, my friend. It's the cinematic folly that has made a lot of RAZZIE films over the years, whether in the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this film. The first is that I'll never forget the fascinating long legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was in bed before the bad guys attack her house, just dressed in a blue shirt and OH BOY CA should be. But it's strange! As I watched in the following movies and she was not so beautiful anymore? !! Anyway, the second reason is that I recently found the title of this movie in my list of the 100 worst movies of all time! <br /> <br /> The bottom line: bad movie, great legs.
