I'm a nice person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was definitely the worst film I've seen in a long time. There was very little plot and the most interesting areas that were discussed, that is what Jesus really wanted to know, were ignored and we received heavy doses of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both his character and the audience. The acting was barely there and the direction was not inspired. And, if I had seen another drop of water or a dove flying towards the camera, I may have started screaming louder than Patricia.
