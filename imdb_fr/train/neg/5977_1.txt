Sensational. I do not even remember much about this movie, except that it smells bad. <br /> <br /> The plot is fundamentally; the parents of a girl neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be his father. Am I the only one to be disturbed by this? Then this weird PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to pretend to be that of the girl. I do not care if he tries to make the girl happy, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny kid who wanted things his way. She played with Unowns, was Entei's "girl" and, apparently, she could grow up and shrink on age with the help of her "father". <br /> <br /> That's about all I can remember, but think you can take it as a clue and not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect much.) 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon, the first movie".
