* Contains spoilers * This movie is horrible and horrible from the 80s. The plot takes a lot of time to take off, never stabilizes, then crashes completely after 40 minutes of filming. There are some precious moments for zombie fans, but not enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. <br /> <br /> Zombies also take a long time to appear. First, there is a whole half of a movie about crowds and prison gangs. The hero of the film is a former Vietnamese veterinarian caught in the crowd. The leader of the main crowd prepares him and he goes to prison. In this prison, they experiment with prisoners to find a way to heal them from homicide and criminal behavior. But Badie's psychotic / military chief scientist has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ... a man ... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners have killed some guards and the majority of the prison has an infected communion wine tour, the mad scientist / scientist says "hey, that could be a problem" and calls the scientific genius turned investigative reporter Ultra hot babe - independent female character, of course, who invented the original serum. She goes to the prison to see what happens, the military calls some SWAT teams from his secure post outside the prison and the hero takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out. The hero and the woman scientist / journalist team up to find treatment, save the guardian's children and deal with angry prisoners, infected or not. Meanwhile, the mafia leader has made an agreement to enter the prison in order to save his imprisoned brother. The military is getting ready to blow up the place and everyone inside is struggling to find a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many bloody scenes in which people are killed while being in a hurry or shot through the bars of the prison. There is also a frightening decapitation scene and an electrocution scene involving the same infected Rasta prisoner. However, the most disturbing scene is at the beginning of the film, when a rudely corrupt guard violates a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is a scene towards the end. The hero, the woman and the children are trying to make their way to the only escape. Their path leads them in a long corridor, on one side there is a wall and on the other bars of prison. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands pass through their hair and faces. There are also some good scenes from the classic "zombies couple nibbling dead corpses" and "many zombies ripping a tattered guy". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth looking if you're looking for the zombie genre that has so many zombie cliches to note; it's pretty much an instruction manual on what not to do when creating a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie movies and want a real scare, you should go elsewhere.
