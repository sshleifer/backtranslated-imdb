I think I watched this movie, but do not quote me, because I may have fallen asleep while I saw him, because he did not really want to "capture my excitement and imagination" At least I know that I have looked enough to know that I will not look at him soon. Or never. <br /> <br /> My God, talk about lame ... Really lame. Totally lame. That would not even please a six-year-old. Basically, this had NO interesting dramatic impact. Nothing. Nada. Shlock just became dreck. The comedy? It was supposed to be a comedy? You could have fooled me ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if the extraterrestrials had been insatiably carnivorous, as in the movie "Critters", we could have made the human characters do something deeper than being cute too cute. .. like screaming and screaming and running for their lives so as not to be eaten so that the story could be something more exciting than watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this. It is not worth the trouble. You can find something more interesting to do. It's like watching the paint dry. Or fall asleep.
