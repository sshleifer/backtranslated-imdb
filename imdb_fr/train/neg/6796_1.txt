Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic enemy, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how having sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) can be considered fun or fun. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that these types of films fuel the fire of hate and reinforce misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized", but I think we still have a long way to go before we can erase the surface of civilization.
