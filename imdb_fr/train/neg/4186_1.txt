My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite in harmony with mine. What makes me understand is the fact that a movie is stupid and devoid of any semblance of history, motive or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that substituting words for songs that will inspire no one outside of a declining audience is not about creating characters that are motivated to speak because of events created by author or director. A silly story remains despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is when the devil makes his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way on the dance floor to say the words of Young Song to the heroine, who ignore what's going on. occurred. In one way or another, these two imagine a plan in which they will go to the west coast in search of ????? Sorry, Neal stays true to the music and leaves the film to Steven Stills.
