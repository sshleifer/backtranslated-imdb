and not a fun way to watch. it's just bad. it's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story is nil, the acting is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! the painting has hands coming out of it! oh gee - the mirror turned into water! the hair, clothing and makeup in the 1950s scenes are not accurate, and they had a middle-aged man with a hair line set back to play the high school version of himself. it's like a nightmare later on Elm Street. I like to sit down and watch a horror movie as much as anyone, but there are better choices to choose from.
