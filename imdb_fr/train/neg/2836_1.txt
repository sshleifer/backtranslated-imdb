I saw this schlock festival visible on a video store shelf. And before getting my first VCR, I thought I would baptize with this little gem and it's really bad to make a movie! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is involuntarily hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicably there. And many, like Christopher Walken seemed to want to play in all the bad movies of his last years. This film is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It has lines like "Shut up and let me fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "you say a lot of shit!" <br /> <br /> And the invaluable return: "Unfortunately, it's sh_it, a sh_it hard and furious!" <br /> <br /> You will be amazed by a fight scene while Bo makes a SOMMERSAULT on a pool table! And kung fu kicks off when she gets out of the roll! Cut the socky action and the thrills T and A !!! <br /> <br /> What can a schlock movie fan ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to haunt Bo like a ghost, she asks him why he killed himself rather than dealing with his debilitating illness? He says, "Real men do not eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo were a smart cookie, she would call an exorcist!
