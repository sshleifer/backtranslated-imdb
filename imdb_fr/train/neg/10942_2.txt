Lorenzo Lamas plays the role of Jack `Solider` Kelly, a veteran veterinarian from Vietnam and a renegade police officer who is on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from the red maniacs. An atrocious movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is billed for the third time, and yet has 3 minutes of on-screen time, and even those are not good. All in all, it's a dreadful movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging on a bagged and gagged tree are worth some (unintentional) laughs. Followed by an improved suite.
