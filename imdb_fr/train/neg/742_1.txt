If this film had a budget of 20 million euros, I would just know where the money went. A monkey could produce better CGI effects than what had been lost for 3 hours on this horrible garbage, although I must admit that the machines and the Martians would have been really, really cool, on an original game from the game station 1 and first PC games. from the mid-90s if a game had already been done. What makes me puzzled? Where did the money go? Pendragon's films could have made a good movie with good old models and computer-controlled cameras, like George Lucas around 1975-1983, and actors who really seem to care what they do (or ruin in this case for the same thing. 20 millions. It may be the worst movie of all time! I would rather watch a 24-hour rehearsal of Ishtar than watch the movie again. I hated it completely! I regress. I say it's THE WORST film ever made because, unlike other bad films like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus conquer the Martians, these films are so terrible that they have a special place in your heart, you love them. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD library for that. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money for the movie was spent on alcohol and other vices for the actors and the team. Shame on you, Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
