The legal gray zone concept in Love Crimes contributes about 10% of the movie's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to his blatant malice. To say that Sean Young's work as a prosecutor is wooden is a euphemism. With his faded costumes and superfluous hair gel, Young is doing decent work to convince the public of his fervent hatred of men. If not, why would she ask her only friend to be a prostitute so she can stop the cops trying to attack them? This hatred is also the only reason she relentlessly pursues a perverse photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this shitty movie. Watching Young go from total nudity to frontal nudity does not arouse much interest, but the tantrum she stirs up near a fire near a lake does the same. Watching her declaim with self-hatred and sexual frustration, love crimes are worth the price, but everything is downhill. Despite his desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, his policing skills completely elude him because of his tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a pretty decent job as a googly sociopath; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy, it is certain that it can work. But I can not help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy that Young brings to the film is in conflict with her leanness. I imagine that's the case and the result is a "thriller" with thrills that are both terrible and comical.
