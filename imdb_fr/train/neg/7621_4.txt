As it was noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently under the title "You've Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of several versions, this is my least favorite. The problem, in my opinion, is that the studio revolves around the charisma of the stars, which does not really cut it here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two tracks never overflows in this film. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of one-day donuts, nice but bland. And when the tracks are boring, the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. It looks like she does not have a neck! I do not know if she had pain problems or anything like that, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into her shriveled shell and everything. I could not understand why Van Johnson was getting so hot. I would have made a bee line for this cute violin player. And Van was not great either. I have always thought of him as a generic Hollywood executive and he is not doing anything to dispel that image. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you might like this movie. But there are many more entertaining romantic comedies and they offer you more than just bites of confectionery.
