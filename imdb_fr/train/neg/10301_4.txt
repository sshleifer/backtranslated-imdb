It is a bit odd that a story in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of local residents are of Asian origin does not even show an Asian or African person, not even as an extra. This fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general. - However. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY ONE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy represents four young people living in a roommate apartment in Oslo. The protagonist consists of two young men who can not manage their lives seriously. One could even say that the film could be undecided and avoid responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The story plays on the dreams and fantasies typical of teenagers and on models of life. Quite the clich√©. Although the story is a little funny, the acting is good and as a "young", we can identify with the "crazy" characters and complicated love stories. I can not find the story or the very credible characters. To polish and lack of depth. This film uses all the classic tricks of the public to create an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes, on TV). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film finally found its identity ?: Public pleasers in the well-known American style. <br /> <br /> How about watching Tillsammans (Together) by Lukas Moodysson.
