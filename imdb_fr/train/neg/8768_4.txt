Now, please, do not start calling me by names like "unpatriotic", "weird" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this film (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No editing at all - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell too much in love with his project. Even Lagaan lasted 4 hours - but it was entertaining and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It's based on real incidents and real people. Well done, but were the repetitive war scenes really necessary? On top of that, the attention shifted constantly from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep track of all. <br /> <br /> Between the skirmishes, there were songs about loneliness, heartache and related stuff. There were friendly conversations. At first, it somewhat relieved the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict the nature of the interview ahead. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk around like they were lions in the jungle, totally unaware that the enemy was hiding somewhere near? And when they were shot down, it generated sympathy, but it seemed to them indifferent to be so sure of their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was melodious and the lyrics were melodious but did not fit the film. Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie. <br /> <br /> Playing was saving lives: veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, close beginners like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone was acting like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention to brighten the mood whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> The dialogues range from awesome ("From Madhuri .. with love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan gets zyada musical Hindusthan mein hain"). And the explosive frenzy consisting of all MC, BC, Cs and F-words was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to pay a fitting tribute to courageous Indian soldiers, but tries too hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
