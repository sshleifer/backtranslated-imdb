Having heard so much about the Cracker series of the 1990s without seeing any, I can not wait to see it. The combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not be wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversy, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, was overwhelming. The production tried to be ultra-modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish fonts irritated. Robbie Coltrane slept for two hours, discovering unexplained and improbable "news", and the police have been described as a one-dimensional fool. As a result, the tension never increased and the scene of the penultimate scene (no details for fear of the revelators) was a television drama as ridiculous as what I had seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see any more, but I'm going back to the DVDs of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.
