I was faithful to myself for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the entire movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the movie was. After much discussion, we all agreed that it was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> That does not fit very well together. It's too hectic and there is little comedy. I am disappointed It could have been a lot better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to see this film based on the notes of the booklet. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money if you're not a fullist and do not want to see all the movies of Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
