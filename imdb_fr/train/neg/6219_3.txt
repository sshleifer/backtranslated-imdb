When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to think it would be as comforting as some of Lassie's early films. No. <br /> <br /> The story was catastrophic, the Sherman brothers' songs were way below their usual level, the characters were uninspired, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had both had better days. I also wanted to know how ALICE FAYE's contribution would be, since she had been absent from the screen for so many years and had always been so exhilarating in her first roles at Fox. Alice was also disappointed by the senseless scenario and the unflattering photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing interesting for an adult, and of course, no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this one without missing anything.
