Buck's role as Kahn is reminiscent of Bob Barker (from The Price is Right) who runs a country the same way he directs his show. But there is much more to laugh and sniff in this turkey. Kurt Thomas, as a "hero" with a baby face, has considerable acrobatic skills, but not the slightest acting talent. There are some phantasmagoric moments (in the village of Crazies mainly) and slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any movie "Ninja" will give you a lot more entertainment and you will not feel as guilty of laughing.
