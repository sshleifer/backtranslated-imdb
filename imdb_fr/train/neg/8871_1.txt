I'm probably watching 200 movies a year, both at the movies and at home, and I can say with certainty that this movie is by far the worst I've seen this year (if it's ever, though I do not have not seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet). This film is just a bad joke after a bad joke for the 13 year old girl and because I did not have the pleasure to see him during a bus trip, I could not go out. one in the rental corridor. The four dollars could be better spent in any movie with the numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
