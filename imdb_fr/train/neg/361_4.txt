After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie, I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ, but there were two different stories. Only the names and a part of the story of the book remained. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the film. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and interest you. The locations were indeed consistent with the descriptions of the book. Some characters not included. The television has put in the microwave as many books and exceptional stories, it is a perfect example of that. The author's contribution does not always ensure a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
