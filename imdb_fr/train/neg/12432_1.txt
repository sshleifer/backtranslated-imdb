This is the worst movie scam I have ever seen at home! Look at parts 1 and 2, but do not let anyone say it's better than the first two! I mean, really, you do not make a film, you do not follow up with the same characters and actors, then you do another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would have been nice if it had not been a Home Alone movie, but they made it a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old now, so you're supposed to stop doing sequels! Divine goodness, this movie makes me sick! Buy parts 1 and 2.
