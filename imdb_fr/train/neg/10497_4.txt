So, Steve Irwin. You must admire a man who is not only willing to jump into a river that is clearly filled with fangs, snakes, lizards, tons of poo of the aforementioned reptiles and mud, not only every day, but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make me want to do it, but he managed to bring his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This film does not fit into my parallel universe of film category - movies for those who have just had their teeth are pierced, have migraines, or have no cinematographic experience and therefore a Discreet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney movies). It's too noisy. Steve is too loud. He's just so happy all the time, and goes through jaded teenager (I can hear it now: "this movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm wins, but if it did, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agree that they are beauties, but I'm still not going to pet them. <br /> <br /> The plot was indeed predictable. The bad guys were so mean, I thought for a minute that I was shopping in a consumer electronics hypermarket. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, that's why I watched it. This plot (if you could call it that) was really another reason to throw another hook into a truck. My expectations were low and stayed as they were. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, however, that there would be a little more, when Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with real plot and more furry animals. I still can not believe we will not see Steve anymore. I hope Terri and the kids continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and Discovery Channel, at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without a member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful this crocodile is. Crikey!
