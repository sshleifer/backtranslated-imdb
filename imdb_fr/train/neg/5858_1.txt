This was attributed to the fans because the "winner takes everything" the match took place between two distinct "companies" (the World Wrestling Federation and "the Alliance": a merger of former superstars of the WCW and the ECW: Because the final match is to dupe the upper society It was a team match, the wrestlers were confined to throwing their opponents on either side of the ring and each wrestler concluded that to counter their opponents and intensify the match it is necessary to interfere, strike, perform a special move and associate a partner.The scenario had already been tarnished by Vince's subterfuge that a member of the Allance would be fradulent and join the WWF. with this statement, that the WWF Overall: very innovative scenario, but poor performance, which is not the shortage of wrestlers, because the format of the match is tag-team.The remaining matches are only shocking: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T is: powerful "big boot" of Test, but it does not show the true talents of the two stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow Versus Christian: good game but superflux pay-per-view <br /> <Taji vs. William Regal: the worst game of the night Royal Immunity Battle: It was an extremely fun match to watch, but because the main stars of two companies participated in the main event, only one wrestler who typically appears on "Heat" and is likely a rejection of the WCW light heavyweight (ie the hurricane that is simply hired in as an artist) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz: The best match of the night: Jeff Hardy performed a "Swanton Bomb" from the top of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt was stuck in the cage, which seemed extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the hardcore champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the alliance. , all the fundamental stars of the "Alliance" event were awarded work after the end of the match, with the exception of Booker T., who recently attacked a wrestler at "Raw" and will inevitably see himself reward. Shane McMahon will return to television one way or another and everyone wants to witness the fall of the "Alliance" to see Stone Cold unemployed. WWF has done a lot better. A match in which all the players would be united in a faction would have been better, and that became the matches of Casket and Iron Man?
