As an inspiring filmmaker myself, this film was exciting to watch with critics in mind. Shot with a low-end digital camera probably with a 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is correct, the sound effects are not exaggerated. I would have given a 7 for an independent film, but the story is not so interesting. It's more on the theatrical side, character development than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This is not for those who want to be scared, scared and disgusted, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy it. <br /> <Honestly, this movie would be nice if we were still in the 50's <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's exactly it.
