I tried to watch this film twice and, even then, to move quickly in the irritating parts, but I still could not get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie * really * got good reviews. I think those people who give such good reviews are just trying to make the film known for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and it sounds like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. The movies should have real positive comments about their own steam and not artificial !! <br /> <br /> The acting game evoked a cheesy, not funny, porn movie. I have no problem watching low-budget movies with bad actors if they know how to work with them. <br /> <br /> I found the main character irritating. Her facial expressions and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was intentional to make the women's conspiracy more pleasant and well founded, but it was even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very delicate (speech of his excessive business leader) and sarcastic remarks little funny. <br /> <br /> I have not found anything that redeems this movie except some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that an assessment was so misleading. I was interested in his principle but frightened by everything else. Of course, see it if you want, but I just did not want others to hope and waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
