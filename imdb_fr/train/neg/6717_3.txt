It was awful. The story was ubiquitous and most often, I was confused because of a horrible editing. I did not feel sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial, without any dimension. Stereotypes cheesy, cheesy with secondary intrigues that go nowhere. The stripper girl was just a distraction, even though she looked decent. I do not know what that was trying to be, but how shocked were they when they showed this junk at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. One would think that a channel like this would show more quality movies. There are many, many of the best gays and lesbians-themed movies. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really enjoyed "Wigstock: the movie". I'm sure there are others that have escaped me for the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it was not worth it. If you see that on TV, all right, but otherwise, do not worry. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four really beautiful shots (sad to be able to count on one hand), otherwise the cinematography was pretty bad too. The lighting was off in many places. I think some of the effects were used to add something that had virtually nothing to do. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is very hot (without blond hair, of course). Too bad his game did nothing for me. Stick with real porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
