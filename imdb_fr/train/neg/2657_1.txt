I waited for this film to be played with a lot of anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately described as the movie "The Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to my friends and family asking them to watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny part of my "new" life. After seeing this movie, I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knew the pain, I had hoped that this film would enlighten "thinking" parents to understand the sorrow of a parent who has lost a child. This film was very light and Diane Keaton's foolishness was a slap to the parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. After the movie, I had a few calls, each calling the same message: "It was so unexpected and it seemed like very quickly, you're back on the road and you're listening to songs on the radio and life is back Â»bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because none of them would NEVER have made the film to be so far from the goal. I guess it's Hollywood.
