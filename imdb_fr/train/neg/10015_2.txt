Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is typical of the 1950s in a shocking film. It's not a horror movie or science fiction. The plot concerns a group of teenagers who are about to get fired from their hot rod club because they can not pay the rent. Once evicted, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only grace that saves the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the costume of She Creature) turns out to be a monster out of the movie played by Blaisdell.
