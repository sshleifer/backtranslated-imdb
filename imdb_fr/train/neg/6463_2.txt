I watched Free Money last night and it was the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought I was a feast - especially since I'm a fan of Brando. FALSE! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch sometimes (like the scene of cattle prods), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous configurations (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character returning towing the truck of Brando?) Ugh. It's a wacky comedy, but I did not care. Skip this one. Only for Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst movie of all time was Skidoo.
