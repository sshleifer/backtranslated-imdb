Just like last year's event, the WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was marked by a match against the elimination chamber. The difference between previous years and those of this year, however, was the value of entertainment. In fact, only three people had a chance to leave the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, with the WWE Championship. These men were current champions John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. It was impossible for Vinnie Mac to put the belt on one of the recruits; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane held the last WWE title in June 1998 and it was only for one night. It was obvious that he was not going to be either. Last year, the match was exciting with six of the best players in the WWE. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair, but remained by far the game of the night. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening was after the bell of the main event. Vince McMahon himself walked around and demanded that they raise the room. It was later announced that Edge was cashing his money in the championship game against the bank at that moment. Due to lack of time to prepare and not lose the Elimin Chamber victory match, John Cena has no chance and drops the title after a spear at one of WWE's most entertaining heels. This was the only entertaining action that took place all night. <br /> <br /> The carte blanche, like last year, was really atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show are hosting a snoring party that made me struggle to stay away. HHH won, but did not there ever be any real doubt? Any payment at the meeting where Jerry Lawler and Viscera are fighting on the same card will have no chance of succeeding, will actually do so. The king pinned Helms (who booked this stuff?) And Big Vis had the defeat of Shelton Benjamin, who had been ruined, with a little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> WWE women also spent a busy night. There was the usual nonsense of the Diva with a Braunt and Panties Gauntlet match that was won by Ashley and the women's championship was also in play. In one match, I thought it would have been necessary to prepare until WrestleMania 22, Mickie James, challenges Trish Stratus. Trish won the contest, but it was obvious that it would continue in the near future. <br /> <br /> The Opening Contest of the evening will soon pit WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair. It could have been better, but it was a beaten and bloody Flair that was held back after an end to disqualification. Edge obviously had a bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So the New Year's revolution launched the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in a disastrous way. The only good thing about this is knowing that for WWE, the only way to do it is to get by. They do not become worse than that.
