Since the world of moviegoers met a certain George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-soaked horror images and non-stop sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. Yet, in the early years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was simply used in slow psychological thrillers, almost without action. The film "I walked with a zombie" by Jacques Tourneur is a perfect example, as well as "White Zombie" with Bela Lugosi. This "revolt of the zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately, it is a failure all the way and easily one of the most tedious films I have ever seen. A terrible actor's act, a very badly written script and a total lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half-hour is completely ruined by stupid intrigues of love stories and monologues without any emotion. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could certainly have given rise to a more fascinating story, but we only see interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, a classic blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me a lot and I kept hoping that a voracious living dead suddenly appeared to devour her. Unlucky again? If you manage to fight for 60 unhealthy minutes, you will be rewarded with a pretty decent finish. However, it is far too little to give this film a positive note, much less a recommendation. To avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see if you have seen it all.
