This is perhaps the worst show I have ever seen. Aside from the lack of taste for having a sitcom on Hitler, it's just not fun or entertaining. It looks a lot like a 1950s sitcom in its humor and artificial situations, but although it can be done well as in I Love Lucy, it's just not funny. I think the series was based on the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a frantic sitcom figure" but it has fallen flat in all respects. The guy who plays Hitler is so martial that it's hard to stay alone. I wonder what could possibly have caused the network to think it was a good idea to broadcast it. I thought America had a tasteless show, but the British beat us this time. America would never broadcast a sitcom on Hitler, although we had this show on Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. It is likely that you will probably never see this show, since it has only aired one episode and will probably never be released on DVD.
