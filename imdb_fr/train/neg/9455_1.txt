Well, I guess I know the answer to that question. For money! We have been so bombarded by Cat In The Hat advertising and products that we almost believe there must be something good about this film. I admit I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give them a chance. I should have gone with my instinct. It was a complete garbage can of Hollywood. Prove again that the average person can be programmed to believe that everything they say is good must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film only lasts about 80 minutes, it obviously started with a devoured scenario. It is full of failed attempts at senseless humor and dreadful pastel landscapes. He jumps everywhere in the universe without destination or direction. This is then composed with, ............................ yes I will say, BAD ACTION! I could not help feeling that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat supposed to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not a prize either, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another film with Austin Powers. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
