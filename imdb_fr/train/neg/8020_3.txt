There were beautiful pieces of poetry, but this is actually an artistic-fartsy draw, without direction or resolution. How do these people go through film school? who gives them money to do this shit? It could have been a lot more, good actor, and I still love Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alternative rock metaphor of looking needlessly unable to find something convincing is so tired, and it's useless. movies. the director has to leave and live his life for a long time without coming back to the camera until he really has something to say. it's like the craft school of spinning spaghetti on the wall, just juxtapose a series of serious images and hope for poetry. it can work if the director has a vision or a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is only a filling space, inconsequential. I felt that the lazy end was going to arrive a few moments before that happened and I was screaming on the screen "you, lazy bastard" when the credits appeared.
