A very bad result. Part 1 has had a lot of fun - Part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and obviously aims to get money out of the fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only funny moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who seems to be worse than other characters. It's pretty easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The scenario is sloppy / non-existent. The director should be of service to everyone and leave work immediately. The acting is worse than a 2nd-grade play. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is appalling too, but who can blame the filmmaker / actors of sound for working with such a talented director?
