As far as HEIST films are concerned, this one is rather weak. The continuity is pretty ugly, there is not enough continuity of character to really feel that you understand one of the characters. Peter Falk is awesome, and he is one of the reasons he is worth watching. Falk has some good words, like "he'll come back, he'll buy some saugages" or something ... there are some beautiful scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors. The direction, script and editing are pretty ugly.
