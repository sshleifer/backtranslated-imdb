... the children actors were annoying. In addition, it seems that the directors of this film have trouble filling 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, however. Without death scenes, this movie would look very Disneyish. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist of the child did not seem as frightened as it should have been. If I were in the woods with a ghost-killer, you can bet I would not be strolling and cycling. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've seen worse (that is, it's waiting) but it's nothing that I would look at again, or would recommend to anyone else worry about it, unless you're a passionate horror collector.
