There have been many unknown films or films that have received bad reviews that I really liked. He was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was an excessive gesture and photographic techniques that made me feel like watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and it took almost the entire movie to start, and then you were asked "Is that all?" Once, I decided not to take the film too seriously and to look at it from a purely nerdy point of view, it became more enjoyable. It is a film that would have ended on MST3000 if it was still lit.
