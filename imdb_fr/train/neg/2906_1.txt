-can contain spoilers ... but believe me, this movie is spoiled from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I entered this film with great expectations. It was my own fault. I had put too many actions in Steve Carell's album so far. Virgin of 40 years ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The Office. And I also made the mistake of coming on IMDb and seeing a user rating of 7.5 before going to the movie. This has always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is really not going on lately. The last time I felt embarrassed and in such pain in a movie theater, I watched "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This movie has failed from beginning to end. The script was a bulky material. Horrible writing all around. "Assassin of love"? "Love is an ability"? Whoever wrote this shit suffered the same affliction that struck the writers of American Beauty ... trying to make waaaayyyyyy too strong. The entire movie was peppered with three company moments like the horrible and artificial shower scene. Or the aerobics scene useless / confusing. Or the scene of the terrible laundry room. As soon as you think that something serious and / or real is about to happen, they end up in one of those terrible moments. And it happens again and again. <br /> <br /> And what about Carell's character? Does the guy meet lame people in a bookstore and suddenly fall madly in love? Let's face it. Their conversation was nil. They should both have said goodbye after a few minutes. Pay special attention to the original conversation when you have the misfortune to watch this movie ... Carell's character is trying to say something absolutely random and not very funny (I think the exact phrase was this: "kid "... that's all, seriously), but both are laughing so hard that the coffee is about to burst out of the nose. The actors themselves seemed to be in pain and wondered why they were being asked to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb database ... you have to find a way to Keep the promotional team out of a movie off this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious that the first 20 or so notes / reviews were published by 12-year-olds or Flunky's hired by the studio. Check out The Family Stone's rating ... if it's a 5-year-old, then it must absolutely be a 2 ... and it pushes it.
