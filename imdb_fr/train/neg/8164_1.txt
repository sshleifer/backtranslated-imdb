I saw this movie in a real movie theater (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12 years old, I suppose, and we were really involved in horror movies. I remember being so excited to see him because my cool uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably will never have done it again!) And so disappointed after that !! Just boring and not scary. The only thing that redeems me, I remember, was Silver Spoons' Corky Pigeon, and it was not that bad, it was just a person I recognized. I have already seen bad movies and this one has always seemed the worst. From what I remember, it was one of the most annoying, scary waste of our $ 6 total, and a waste of film. I read some of the reviews that say it's worth watching and I say, "Too much for everyone", but I would not even bother. Not so bad that it's good.
