If you study Welles and want to know how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The inexpensive excuse to make the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-cooked ploy does not explain the absurd theatrical courtrooms and ridiculous twists that ensue. Do not be taken into account by the high rating of this movie in the database, as I was; All I can guess is that there are a lot of old fans of Welles and Hayworth.
