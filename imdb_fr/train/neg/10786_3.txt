How this movie was made with so many big stars is beyond me. It's a dreadful movie with the worst actors ever made by these actors. It really surprises me to see so many of the stars on the list to accept this funny little movie. What is even worse is that almost 100 million dollars are manufactured here in the States. This shows, however, that big stars can win, even if the film is terrible. I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snoring party. Billy Crystal did his best with what he had received and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking in the movements. Whatever you do, do not fall into the trap of the excellent casting, because nobody could have saved him.
