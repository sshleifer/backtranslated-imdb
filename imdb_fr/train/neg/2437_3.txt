Well, I'll start by admitting that I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I watched "The Informer" only because I'm trying to make my way through a list of "big guys".) So, if you do, keep going, because you're not going to agree with me . <Br /> <br /> What stupid and outmoded stupidity! I would say that there is a good movie idea here (it made me think of the few films about the Irish revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under an overrated and cheap feeling. I guess it's kind of interesting to watch for a moment to see the delicate transition from silences to "talkies" - some of the directors' gaming styles have that overflowing quality endemic to the early movies and movies feel they could play better with title cards than spoken dialogues. (Of course, the title cards would prevent Ford from repeating every emotion six times.) The dialogue that there is usually has a "They are always after me lucky charms!" quality which is compounded by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his own personal version of the Irish accent. Of course, as overwhelming as they are, the accents remind us that we are in Ireland, because the sets give the impression that they were taken from a German Expressionist play filmed on the next sound stage. (It looks like with an eagle eye, you could see villagers go out in flames to play Dr. Frankenstein.) <br /> <br /> The techniques are changing. Tastes change. So, I'm not going to say how crazy it seems that this movie was so acclaimed in its day. But this is not one of the classics that resists, but rather a "just warning" about the kind of simplistic malarkey that Ford was going to devote his career to.
