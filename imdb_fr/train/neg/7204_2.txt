It's one of those movies that you think producers would refuse to release because it's terrible. Obviously, they thought that children are stupid and excellent at absorbing endless commercials. They would think they are an entertainment because it's funny. What about the talking car with buttons saying Wendy's, McDonald's, M & M's and Skittles? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw is supposed to be diabolical, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everet still "Griffe"? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? Looks like they (badly) tapped Robo Cop, turning a man into an Android fighting crime. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy that if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you do not get a refund. I'm sorry to have watched more than 30 minutes of this pile of shit. After learning the no-refund policy, I decided to look at the rest of the hideous garbage called Inspector Gadget.
