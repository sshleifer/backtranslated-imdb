I will give credit to the merit and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a drunken actress who does what she wants. She is impetuous, impertinent, hard and very sexy; she is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's all. This dull thriller is a fragmented mess that tries to be a thriller for stalkers, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal and an erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not thrilling at all. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought of founding C. Thomas Howell as a desirable main character? It is not ugly, but if we're right, it seems that the goddess of Fiorentino, who has tough biscuits, gets along with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to play the lead role. <br /> <br /> The scenario is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension while the character of Fiorentino receives strange calls, there is no mystery as to his guilt in the murders covered by the film, there is no feeling of liberation while Fiorentino is disgusted by Howell to lose his inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but poorly made cameos from Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, as well as a very, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. On top of that, my first instinct would be to throw that damn garbage and go rent something else.
