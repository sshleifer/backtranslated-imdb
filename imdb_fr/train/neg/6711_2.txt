1993 was the year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him? I was actually an extra paid in "My Boyfriend's Back", which was shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank goodness, the producers changed their mind!) I was in the theater world. I rushed to watch the movie on the day of its theatrical release. It's more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... to laugh, you might want to take a look at it. Nothing that is even close to the quality "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is pretty good. ciao
