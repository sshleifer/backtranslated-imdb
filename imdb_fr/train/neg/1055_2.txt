* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First, I rated this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the film, without success. make it the psychic drama it could have been. First of all, she never fights alone. After a very strange initial doubt on the part of her mother (which is inconceivable when the mother is so supportive and loving later in the film), the rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive and always falls into the strange traps of the crew. <br /> <br /> His friends are incredibly naughty. <br /> <br /> What I find most incredible is that Ethan can not control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is really the leader of the team (hey, they even say it) and people seem to think that the other is a fool, but when Ethan changes his mind, he just can not convince a single member of the team. that he is right and that his old friend is wrong. Everyone just hates it ... why? The film provides no explanation. How did he ever become the leader? <br /> <br /> It's funny to note that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same hit TV series ... an inexpensive way to have viewers?
