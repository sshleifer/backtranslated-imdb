Can I do it until I need glasses? proves at least that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who have let loose this damn heap of sputum vomited on the world lack any semblance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should be newly labotimized children and infants who play with their own excrement. Everyone would be too wise of the world to even get a laugh of this movie. It consists of a series of sophomore sketches in which the punchline does not even go to the obvious. It ends in ridicule. The jokes told are the types of jokes that primary school children (usually clean or sexually related) tell about in which they do not know the meaning of all the terms used. You know, like that of dad's car and mom's garage. Applying a harsher method of criticism would be useless, as the usual norms of action, writing, direction and others have never been heard by creative "minds". behind this mess. In order not to be judgmental, all who love this film must seriously think about their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
