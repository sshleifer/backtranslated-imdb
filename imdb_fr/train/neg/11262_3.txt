Adrian has just come out of the asylum, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day, he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to make money, Gonzalo helps Adrian research his life and that of his parents. It's a film by a new director, and it's perfectly clear in most films: misdirected scenes, dialogue a little forced, some inconsistencies in the scenario ... Anyway, the end is surprisingly well done (well, a little) and it saves a little film. The actors are known and of high quality, but they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; all made better papers in other films. The results of the film are boring and you will probably spend most of your time thinking about how long it will take until the end. Of course, there are many worse films, but of course there are many better ones.
