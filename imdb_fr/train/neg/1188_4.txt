Kurosawa really bluffed him. Every genius is allowed to fail. The concept is good but the execution is very fuzzy. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic air in this film that makes it an art film. The poverty struck by Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic representation. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing film.
