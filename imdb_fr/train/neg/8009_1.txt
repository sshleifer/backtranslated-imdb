In The Lost Son, a private eye in search of a missing man stumbles over a child prostitution ring. This movie incorporates all the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the spirit of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap. If you have the chance to see this, you'd better get lost.
