I had the "privilege" of attending a special screening of "The Absence of Light" at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know that you have problems when the director presents a film, saying: "Now, keep in mind that we did not have a lot of money .. "It's not that films without budgets are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always mediocre. And there is no better example than this unassailable sleep feast. <br /> <br /> In fact, "Absence of Light" marks a first in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time I've seen a dream cast of talented veterans bored me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister enter and leave the film at random and are as uninteresting as non-amateur names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? We do not care? Everything is so boring that you will stop worrying about anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and got out of the theater. Unsurprisingly, most of the cast members present did the same. <br /> <br /> All curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this. With a little luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
