I never finished this movie for a reason, it was horrible and it's just the acting game. I was not even sure what the movie was saying about it, it did not make much sense and the violence was terrible. I usually mean that I like nudity in a movie (lol) but it was just sick because of what was going on. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was full of screams and the camera trembled in places and it seemed like a continuation of the blair with project but without any quality. This is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time and I would like my time to come back, please. I would not recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (NOT)
