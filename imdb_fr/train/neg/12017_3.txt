I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and Covert-one books, and I've often thought about how incredibly transformed into a movie. Imagine my enthusiasm to learn that such a movie really existed! The "Hades Factor" being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film was disappointing. Simple elements of the film, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and much less uplifting. Several characters are also poorly expressed. For starters, Dorff is sad like Smith. He is not a bad actor, but an incredibly bad choice because he is too soft and lacks many of the defining characteristics of John Smith. <br /> <br /> Rename, reassign and even omit certain characters further degrades this movie. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire history of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the film quite blurry. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he occupies varies a lot in the back (besides the character of the film has nothing in common with the character of the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be Sophie Amsden's sister (she should be called Sophia Russel), but she is also supposed to work for the CIA, NOT "Covert-one". Which brings me to my last point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this stage! Covert-One was designed by the president before the second book in the series as a preventive measure against biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could go on all day. In short, if you like books and want a good adaptation, I'm afraid you are bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie, it's quite average, mainly because of a very poor editing and poor effects. The disordered story and the dull scenario like a water ditch are the last nails of the very good coffin of this film.
