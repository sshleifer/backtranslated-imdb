Yuck. Not bad. The piece is not good at first, and the decision to convert it to a film has no positive influence, especially because Peploe does not decide how she wants to deal with the theatrical origins of the material (we sometimes have glimpses of 'a theater audience, etc.) and decided to choose an unstable editing style that is meant to constantly remind you that you're watching a movie, when in reality it just reminds you that you're watching a movie. very bad film of a director overwhelmed. by its material. The central performance of Mira Sorvino is breathtaking: scene and pen, it's as if she played the role through the work of Merchant Ivory Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a remarkable performance - and her theatrical pedigree means she's better able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a movie for a single performance, even if that performance is as light, truthful, and realistic. just like Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns in a middle and disengaged turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as such. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magics touched his wife if this movie is proof.
