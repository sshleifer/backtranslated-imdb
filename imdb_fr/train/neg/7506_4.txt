Good actors and good performances can not hide a useless scenario, a bad dialogue and spiral patterns of behavior that do not interest you. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering for no particular reason, not teaching us anything and not even bothering to entertain.
