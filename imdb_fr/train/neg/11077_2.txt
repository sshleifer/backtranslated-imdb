The only reason I chose to give it a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is the biggest waste of a good actor in a movie. As far as I know, Borgnine was the ONLY actor. The other performances were so terribly horrible that I am surprised that a studio pays the "interpreters" to appear. Combine this level of talent in the acting department with a story so heavy and tasteless that I thought my eyes would start bleeding at the time of the credits, and you have a perfect film disaster. Clearly, the film was designed to please a children's audience and, to its credit, was better than most original Disney Channel programs and similar networks for kids. But honestly, that does not say much.
