I watched it on a whim because it was available and I had heard that thumbs were funny. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based on the physics of "Geranium" and, in turn, on that of Kate Winslet. I think it's really pathetic for the creators of "Thumbtanic" to go down so low to make a respected actress fold just because she does not let herself die of hunger in the model of the ideal modern beauty . <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that said something like, "Hey, I have a good idea, let's swim to this makeshift raft that nobody seems to see!" Thirty seconds of fun on a 26-minute movie does not redeem its value.
