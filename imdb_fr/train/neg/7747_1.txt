The fact that the cover is a drawing, like these old B-series movies, should warn you of the quality of this film. This is not a serial movie, however. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There is no known actor, and animals - WOW - are the worst data animation ever made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You hardly see the SCAAARY sword presented on the cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and you sometimes see a tiger's tooth or paw. It's so amateurish! Maybee is worth the trip, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I have ever seen and wait for their reaction" He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is too weak to give him a spoiler alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
