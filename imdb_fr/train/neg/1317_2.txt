When the people of Kino Video assembled their collection "Slapstick Encyclopedia", a selection of cassettes with multiple cassettes, someone decided to launch the first opus with ONE TOO MANY (1916), an obscure farce to a coil realized in Florida with the very young Oliver Hardy. As pleasant as the setting is, this decision is unfortunate, because ONE TOO MANY is a very bad movie that almost discourages the viewer from watching more. Like any typical joke, it involves a disappointment inspired by greed, panic when projects go wrong and complications that go to the point of absurdity, but unlike good, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, not funny and downright boring. It is difficult to say at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or the making of incompetent films, but whatever the cause, even the most alert viewer does not no idea of ​​the relationships between the characters or what's going on and in the end, we do not care anymore. <br /> <br /> The "Babe" Hardy, aged 24, has only one interest: it seems much heavier than he would have ten years later, when he teamed up. Stan Laurel, but still full of young energy. In the opening scene, waking up with a hangover, Babe performs a very athletic roll back on a bed. Believe me, it's as funny as this movie becomes. If you read this before you see the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest you move quickly in front of it and go straight to the interesting things.
