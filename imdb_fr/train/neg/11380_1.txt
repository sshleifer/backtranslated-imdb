When I watched Robotboy for the first time, I found it fresh and interesting, but I also noticed that every episode, this show was trying to teach you how to behave, which is good or bad. The episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Once again, we see a super-intelligent boy, beaten by his big brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: a girl and a big boy. Also this show has no logic. An ultramodern robot that works with two AA batteries and can use a lot of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes. We see two different robots and it declines the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn to behave in human society"
