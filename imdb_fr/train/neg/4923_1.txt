It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you really like this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula movies and I liked all the people I saw, but when I saw this movie, I thought, "What's that mess?" What a stupid movie. Now, they have Dracula becoming who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and felt so guilty that he hanged himself. You're joking. This is the most stupid reason I have ever heard to explain why Dracula became evil. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of shit ** this movie is. Who has ever found this excuse for the film must be defeated. Even the Dracula is horrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is this title supposed to impress me? Do not waste your time or money on this trash.
