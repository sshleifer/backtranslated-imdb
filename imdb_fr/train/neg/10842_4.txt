Noting the cast, I recently watched this film on TCM, hoping for an underrated gem, as I consider many films from the 30s. It's not a jewel - not even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothes and the 1930s Rolls Royce limousine immediately hit you. The casting is strange, too. But most of the time, there are too many stupid and unnecessary tracing devices. This movie contains a lot of good ingredients and a promising basic plot, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the right recipe. It simply does not come as it should. And that's a shame. With some rather obvious, but minor changes, it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American star (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and her boyfriend, who play larks in a Rolls Royce belonging to the employer of her boyfriend. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord to whom the Rolls belong and she fixes it. This first part of the film is a light comedy without any real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tone unwittingly discovers the fact that his employer is actually a fifth German journalist on the eve of the First World War. The film then changes completely and begins to collapse. Tone and Harlow are married, but at the beginning of the honeymoon, he is shot by a man named Mata Hari (Benita Hume). Harlow escapes, a spectator accuses him of the murder of Tone. (In fact, Tone heals from his wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow fled to France, where she becomes in love again - this time with a rich French cad (Cary Grant). Tone, now in the army, and Harlow are unexpectedly reunited in Grant's hospital room where he is in rehab after a plane crash. In the next scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning her because she is essentially a gold digger. Harlow never explained that the witness had accused her of murder and panicked! It's one of those unreal failures, movie intrigues and storylines. <br /> <br /> Then, Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot her. She is there to watch her friend, Grant, test the new plane that Tone delivered him from England. Incredibly, Hume and Tone are weakly recognizable, but simply can not place from where! Ok, so it was shot down and nearly died; maybe his memory is a little out of order. But how many men did Hume shoot for her to forget one of her marks? (It does not seem to simulate forgetfulness of memory.) <br /> <br /> It is inexplicable and useless. Hume should have absolutely recognized it, but played timidly when she realized that Tone was not able to place it. This would have been a much better treatment of this issue. <br /> <br /> The final is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as directed, conspired by Tone and Harlow to preserve the boy's good name, Grant, which resulted in his fraudulent burial as a hero. So Harlow and Tone have just left. It is noble to preserve the perception of the French public about their national war hero, but very unsatisfactory as a love story! <br /> <br /> What the movie asks is this: Harlow explains that she fled frantic. murder charges; Your forgive him and gently revive his love for her; he then carries a torch for her, while helping to rig the place of the accident to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad. Then, having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow revives feelings for him too. At the end of the film, they are reconciled even as they work together to model the appearance of Grant's death. After the burial of Grant's hero, we see them kiss and kiss each other during the fade-in. That would have made a good little movie. For fans of Cary Grant, it would have been even better if Tone had clashed with the Frenchman who was killed and Grant the first suffering husband, reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is interpreted as the Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant is presented as the Frenchman. This film would have been much better if they had reversed their roles. It would also have been more conducive to the film that should have been ...
