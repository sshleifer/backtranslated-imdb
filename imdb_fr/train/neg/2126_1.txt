Jason Alexander is a great actor, but it is ridiculous to consider him as a hug and romantic lead role. The fact that he dances so well, crunches so efficiently and throws himself into the game so completely makes him even more terrifying. In her sweetest moments (with the girl in the station, in the last issue with Rosie), I could not leave my eyes of him because he was so repulsive. You still expect him to let go of the nice boy act and start scolding. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see a production of the musical on stage, the 1963 film and this 1995 film, you'll see three versions with more revisions (different songs, identical songs assigned to different characters and in different situations). a musical I have never seen.
