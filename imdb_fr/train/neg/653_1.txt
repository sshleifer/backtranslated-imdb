If I could give a real note to this movie, it would probably be in the less numbers. While I respect the fact that someone has to keep doing these terrible "horror" movies, seriously, buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more profitable. <br /> Even if it's a horror movie, there's nothing scary, unless the idea of ​​seeing how many horror shots you can insert into a movie does not scare you. If the rating had been higher, it would probably have made a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Whoever created this version of "Prom Night", you ruined everything. The actors could probably have done a decent job if there was no questionable script. It was a terrible waste of a trip to the cinema. I would rather go see "One Missed Call" again, at least there was a plot.
