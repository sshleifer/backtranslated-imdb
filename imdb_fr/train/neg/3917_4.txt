"The house of spirits" is pretty terrible. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship like the one the film is trying to describe, and although everyone knows that the films can be very far from reality, this film deals in particular with the viewers as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and straightforward as what appears here, and of course the political processes are much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "The House ...". If you can not show this complexity on the screen, better not to make a movie at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the cinema without so many commonplaces. In some areas, I thought Carmen Miranda could appear inside parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you must not only pay attention, but also respect the intelligence of your audience.
