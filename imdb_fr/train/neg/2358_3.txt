In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teenager of Elm Street. Abandon all fear of foolish attempts at humor and useless celebrity cameos (go .. Roseanne "Tom Arnold ?? !!" WTF?), That's tied with Part 2 is the worst that the rapist of child demon has ever had. Wow was it a piece of shit. Even the legendary Alice Cooper could not remove the stench of this movie. And when they had hell, did Freddy ever have a girl? The entire film is seriously delayed in ways never imaginable, form and form. Rachel Talalay, you steal to heaven, baby. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Biography of actors and technicians; Access the 3D sequence and the options Go to a nightmare (other extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD box) <br /> <br /> Contents of the DVD-Rom: jeu- survey; Scenario; and web link
