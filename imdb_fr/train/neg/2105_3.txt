Bela Lugosi as a senseless scientist who uses orchids to seduce wives to steal the essence of life from an elderly woman. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious !! Many monsters, plus a lot of padding and no intrigue make watching this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the typical Hollywood way. The story never becomes interesting and you feel helpless when you look. <br /> <br /> Normally, I score hits like this, but the dwarf adds just enough goose bumps and attraction to gain a few more points.
