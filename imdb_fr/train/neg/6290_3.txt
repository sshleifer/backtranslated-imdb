Recap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deep and loving and some that they are perfect for each other even if they met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law is not so happy. He fears that the marriage will jeopardize his cushy work in the family business and decides to organize the evening between singles Ron. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, gather evidence and dismantle Ron and Mel. Comments: Supposed to be a sequel to a classic comedy, but it's not funny at all. It is mainly a pubertary show and a juvenile excuse for showing slightly dressed women. In fact, in a way, it's almost impressive to have a lot of things you can put there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, it's also one of the signs of a film that can not stand. It just is not enough. <br /> <br /> There are, however, three points, or three actors who deserve a better scenario than this one. It's the main actor Josh Cooke who manages to give a sense of common sense. Sara Foster, I know, has more talent than making movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously missing are good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are rather rare. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
