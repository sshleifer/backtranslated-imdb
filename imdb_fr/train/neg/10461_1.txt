Interesting to read the comments of viewers regarding the Omega Code ... a lot of extremely positive comments have been raised almost word for word in the TBN shows ... the film seems to have been designed to go directly to the video, to be stored Part of the kidnapping series that was done by another religious group in the 1970s. Do not you remember? You will not remember it in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go out there and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very ashamed ... that shows if you're a televangelist's son, you too can play the Hollywood producer with little ladies to pay the money ...
