WARNING: THE REVIEW CONTAINS DIFFERENT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I managed to see the first five films of this franchise and I intended to do an overview of the entire series of Elm St .. However, just two years later and I find that I do not remember enough of them to be able to do it ?? I guess they could not have made a big impression. From what I remember, some of the suites ?? Dream warriors in particular ?? were not as bad as we often think, even if the original was not a classic. As a rule, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep, they are murdered in their dreams) does not lend itself to narrative tension. But although I do not remember much about the first five films, I know they have never explored the depths of Freddy's Dead. <br /> <br /> We can judge how bad the public is about Freddy at this time. fact that the film was promoted only on the death of the character. The fact that the film's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact, the very purpose of his film serves to illustrate how empty, cynical and soulless this business was. <br /> <br /> Taking the morally dubious idea of ​​having a charismatic pedophile, Robert Englund's frightening interpretation resonates with laughter. I always thought that Freddy's mockery of teenage victims was less about the characters than the teenage audience who could ever watch those guts. It's as if Englund shouted, "We know it's a trash can, but you pay to see it, so who's kidding?" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be discouraged to see such an insensitive description of their fate. Was Freddy's appearance in the movies still rudimentary? All he has to do here is some "haaaaaaaaaaaaaar" har "har" hars "and that's it, if it was the only Elm St. movie you've ever seen, you would not The character that precedes death in a flashback, Englund plays it like a wicked boo-siss villain with a transatlantic irony (that is overestimated, lost and not at all funny). <br /> universally poor, just look at how many times Breckin Meyer is overactive with his hand gestures and his body language.Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity.And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper introduce themselves, you can almost see the film sinking deeper into the mud.The script, too, is absolutely ugly, almost without merit.Carls (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a roadmap on which Freddy, at the way of Noel Coward, has spiritually written: "You are angry." When Carlos told him asks the card, Carlos answers "The card indicates that we are crazy". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or what about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing improving at a painful level? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin ?? a potentially fatal sound, since all sounds are amplified. Strangely enough, the fact that Carlos is screaming so that he does not lose his voice seems to have no effect. "It's a pleasure to hear from you, Carlos," said Freddy, hoping for better lines. It should also be noted that dream sleep does not happen instantly, so being knocked out would not allow instant access to Freddy's world. Although the narrative contains a human computer game and a final three-dimensional plot logic is not at the top of the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers who lead the cast this time are really the most obnoxious. , not nice group in all the series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who can greet Freddy with "shut up, man," and kick the scallops. And was incongruous pop music still part of the ingredients? Freddy's death. No laugh. No fear. Of no interest. No fun. <br /> <br />
