In "ISOYC, IPOYG" by director Eric Stanze, three men are tortured by a woman they all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own shit before being shot. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the fork after refusing to have anal sex with the first man's corpse. But this is the third man who has the worst: he must watch the tattooed "star", Emily Haack, undress and masturbate with a broomstick (oh, he is also cramming the buttocks!). <Br/> <br /> And unfortunately, we too (to be able to see her masturbate, that is to say do not have a broom to protect our buttocks!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a tough viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, who is obviously underestimated, has the misconception that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of a roadie for Metallica) constantly stripped in front of the camera. It is not beautiful to see. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incessant nudity of an inked Haack, viewers also have the chance to see the formidable direction of Stanze (who thinks that infinite plans of tombstones and trees are very fun), some very bad acting, and the penis of a fat guy. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. This is a point for the messy ax attack (which, being a gore-lound, I really enjoyed); a point for the moment when the fat guy gets his face embedded in a chocolate mousse pretending to be excrement (hilarious); and a single point for the courage to suggest that this film could be somehow a continuation of Meir Zarchi's classic superior exploitation, I Spit On Your Grave.
