It was a painful experience, the whole story is really there, so I will not go into it, but the acting was horrible there is this part at the very beginning when the scientific brother gets to work, he wears a white coat at home before going to work, I thought that working with biohazardous material meant that you had to wear sterilized clothing in a controlled environment and that the lab itself looked like a school lab . for the place to look technical and a scientist really lunch in the laboratory and next to him is a pot labeled Biohazard and his boss goes to him and does not even tell him anything about it ... not to mention the very bad bad behavior can not be worse than what my advice does not look and I thought nothing could be worse than the house of the dead apparently the Uwi Boll movies look like the classic Shakespeare compared to that!
