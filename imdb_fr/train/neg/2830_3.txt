If Ashanti had been a serious film attempt on the institution of slavery, still prevalent in Third World countries, the film might have been better received. Instead, it turns into a star disaster of a movie where stars have come in, said their aftershocks and recovered their paychecks without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian work in East Africa. Then comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham to be able to play the role of Muslim slave trader. As Johnson is black, he catches it anyway with a lot of children and some adults too. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine does not kindly support the kidnapping and the rest of the film goes on in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast includes characters such as William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi, who look so incredibly annoyed by all this. <br /> <br /> Generally, it looks like this talented people. like those mentioned above will simply be outrageous and feast on a landscape regime. But Ashanti does not even have that chance. <br /> <br /> What an incredible loss of time. The aroma of tax reduction permeates the air.
