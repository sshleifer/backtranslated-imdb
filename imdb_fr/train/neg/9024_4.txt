"Shinobi" is one of those movies that think that just killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravity or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to care about death, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a series of random acts of violence. The problem is particularly aggravated when you have TONNES of characters who die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you do not want the characters to become memorable or likeable, you can at least make the reasons why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says it. Yet even after it became clear that the emperor wants them dead, they still refuse to give up their meaningless missions. It's not stubbornness ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, good! There is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable reason to fight. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Again, NO! In fact, many fights are not even fights at all: super ninjas for which the film has spent so much time and initiatives to present suddenly die (and sluggishly in my opinion). I speak of things like: "Lalala, I walk and I - * the neck is cut off." THE END for this character. Not even halfway through the movie, I raised my hands to the sky, frustrated by the ridicule.
