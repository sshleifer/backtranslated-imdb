Another weak entry of the third season, "Is there a truth without beauty?" Nevertheless, at least one key element of the plot is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be transported in a black box because its appearance is so horrible that it makes people crazy. It's a shame that the episode can not live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think it was a mistake to always "show" the stranger, his current face does not even come close to such an impressive accumulation; All we get is the standard display of Star Trek psychedelic light used for a lot of things during different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, the appearance of Kollos can at least be tolerated by Mr Spock, and only if Spock wears a special visor. (For a very long time, I thought the stranger was called "Carlos", which I thought was funny, but I move away from the subject.) Spock must merge with Kollos at some point to allow the stranger to fly Enterprise up to security. This is accomplished, but when Spock / Kollos retires to end the merging of his spirits, damn it, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but ends up recovering with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic power. It might have been a very good episode, really weird, but poorly directed, and yet another poorly performed show from last season.
