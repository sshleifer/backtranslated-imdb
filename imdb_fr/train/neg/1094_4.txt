Hard to describe this one - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer's films at the time, you will certainly be pleased to see that Haji always looks very hot, although Forry Ackerman did not look so good. managed to make these movies anyway? If I ride it with a camera, will it be in my movie?). It was a rather fun place - a superheroine whose secret weapon was the gigantic mammal - but sometimes it did not work very long and the jokes were up to your average comedy Joe E. Brown (or Abbott and Costello if that's your thing) - basically, just bad puns. Nevertheless, I found this film fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still a fundamentally fragile production.
