The character of Demi Moore in the film was selected for the SEAL because of his appearance. It was a bad start and the film fell from there. The plot was totally amazing. The desire to be part of a difficult military unit is not enough. This film did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. It's the differences between the sexes that make life interesting.
