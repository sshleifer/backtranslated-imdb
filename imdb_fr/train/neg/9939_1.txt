The intellectuals of film schools can chat about anything they want about the (imagined) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: drooling intellectual. This movie is bankrupt creatively, and some people think it's all about jerking off endlessly. Yeah. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Godard was not a fan of the Stones. Too bad, because it could have been great. He tells the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with a guy reading in a magazine True Detective or with such shit. <br /> <br /> Then there are countless shots that look like 1960s librarians who spray words on people's cars. And then there is the seemingly endless "interview" where the actress has been brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the very deep and intellectual questions. There is a guy in purple suit who reads more shit in a book, which lasts about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a break. <br /> <br /> That seems almost intriguing? Well, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> But for the unwashed movie school hipsters who make fun of the lost opportunities to have full access to the Stones, which allows them to discover Sympathy for the Devil and An English guy who instead, while watching the covers of Nudie Mag, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard is just blowing.
