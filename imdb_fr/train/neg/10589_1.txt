Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie of all time. No, this honor should be awarded to a film that attempts to make a statement or perform an artistic feat, but fails in a pathetic or offensive manner. However, no movie I have ever seen has tried so little and succeeded as completely as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a parody of science fiction / action that has nothing to recommend. The acting is as bad as any movie I have ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who even remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed of themselves. US: The Return gives the impression that the previous Van Damme tariffs are revolutionary cinematographic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you that he is not one of them. I really do not know what else to say here. I doubt that many people would consider this film if they had not already done so, but just in case: do not do it.
