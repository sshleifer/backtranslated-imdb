I did not like this movie. I thought the acting was not very good and the story was boring. A 20 year old computer saving the day? I thought it was just a little exaggerated, even for a movie. I could not understand why they could not turn it off, why not install a hammer. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original film of the 80s, you were expecting a lot more what was actually delivered. This film could have been a 21st century version of the old movie, it was not. If that's what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer had not arrived to save the day, it would still be, in my opinion, a very very old film ..
