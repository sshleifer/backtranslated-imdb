Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only hate each other to the point of hating, but who have few, if any, redeeming qualities that allow a * public * to resemble or sympathize with one of the characters. There are so bad movies that they are good (like those of Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and there are just as many (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is barely tolerable, even if you are a talented riffer MSTie (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, even if I'm rather talented in this respect (this is how my mind works all the time), for those who are not as naturally talented in MSTie riffing, possibly in * this * movie, you'll just want to get out of it, Consciously aware, the movie "Taboo" deprives you of an hour and twenty minutes that you will never find again. Even my MSTie talents barely lived up to this slow and boring loss of time. The most confusing aspect of this film is that * someone * is enlightened and / or financed by this one ... I rented "Taboo" only for the talented Amber Benson, who must clearly have been blackmailed to make this movie. I have another less known movie in its list of renters, the reviews I'd better read first. Ironically, the best part of the movie was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its indoor location.
