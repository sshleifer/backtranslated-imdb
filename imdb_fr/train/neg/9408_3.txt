While watching a video recording of 8 different cartoon films from 1994 to 1997, Spider-man made me understand why I could not stand it at first sight. <br /> <br /> I come from the old school, where the 1967 Spider-man cartoon was the best and always remains the best. (I will not go into the psychedelic version that is terrible - give me traditional villains please.) <br /> <br /> In the new movies, the acting is ugly, read a sheet without feeling or acting too much. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best at dubbing for Spider-man. Nobody comes near. Watching Secret Wars, a brilliant idea for a mini-series of cartoons, made me wince. Dr. Doom looks like a comic version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull does not have a German accent, while Ock is an amazing Russian! The old series of Marvel comic book heroes from 1966 had much better voices. Iron Man looked like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America seemed authoritarian, not like a teenager. Paul Frees as the thing in the 60's was the best thing ever. The old actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Ever heard the son of Mel Blanc? He can not in any case reproduce his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is awkward. Okay, so they have all the nuances of sophisticated characters and beautifully painted backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement is bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer support the movements, they become robotic. I really do not think any of these animators know what's in between. <br /> <br /> The stories are poorly written and some of the lines they give to the heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when the heroes are reunited for the first time, do they start fighting each other? In Secret Wars, it was a lame excuse that put them at odds. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why the Thing and Iron Man can not contain each other is ridiculous, then the Torch joins us. tendencies to bring the heroes to confront each other for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see this stuff. Give them a better reason to fight and you may be able to get rid of them, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "You do not tell me what to do" are BLAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in The Wedding where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to spoil Peter's wedding. This scenario was horrible. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, this is what another critic calls Youth Violence - that is, there is no punch. In Secret Wars, the lizard dodged carefully the charge of the Thing. But the Thing hits the bad guys through an entire block in the comics. He must simply begin to lift heavy objects and master a villain by grabbing him in the caricatures. Of course, these comics are not just for us adults, but for children under 12 years old. That's why they can not receive punches because mom and dad do not believe in this type of violence. But you can blow things up, these drawings will include that. As a child, before the political correctness came into fashion, I saw cartoons beating each other. What's wrong with a punch with chops? Is there really less violence in today's world because these creepy and cunning new cartoons hit the nail on the head? I find this the most insulting of all when I look at the news. They wrote "the punch" because we could all hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Children, enjoy these cartoons at your leisure, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
