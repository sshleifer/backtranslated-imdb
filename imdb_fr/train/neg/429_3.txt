I was seduced by his star, but it's finally all he offers. It sounds much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in big cities. His biggest fault is his predictability and total lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning and we follow them as they fall like dominoes. The film to his credit abstains from all gratuitous violence and sex, but he has forgotten to substitute the good, the clean novel or the excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good decaf and flat diet cola. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, just like "LA Confidential".
