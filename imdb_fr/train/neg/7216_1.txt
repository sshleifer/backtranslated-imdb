I love westerns. I could watch them all day. "The good, the bad and the ugly" is my favorite of all time. I watched "Silverado" probably the eighth time, the other day, because it was broadcast on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst western I have ever seen. The game was terrible all around. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass thing. The only good thing I can think of is the beautiful cantina. The long, very remarkable breaks between the dialogues seemed intentional, if only to save time and to make a movie of an acceptable duration. This film was not worth the new rent I paid for in our local movie rental store. I felt like I was stolen and deserved a rent refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I'm done is because I hate not seeing a movie all the way. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. To the manager, please do a better job if you decide to do another one. This is the kind of film that has the potential to distract people from westerns.
