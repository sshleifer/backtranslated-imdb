Many of King's fans hate this because he has moved away from the book, but the film is a different medium and the books should change as soon as they make the jump. Despite this, the film fails completely, but it fails completely in terms of film. I would like to hit people who tell me that this is the scariest movie ever made. I always followed with the question "Really ... what scene exactly scared you?" All the fans I asked for are silent. From time to time, someone short of a decent fear (there is none ...), names the shtick "Grape-juice-shoot-out-of-elevators". If you are afraid of that, I do not know what to say to you, except maybe you are easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these Z-level horror ideas unfold in this schlocky, incoherent movie. <br /> <br /> A place he diverts from the book and that is really tasteless is the tedious job the film does to get Mr. Halloran to the Overlook only to kill him; The dumbest of spectators knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns of Halloran FOREVER corridor to get down. Really one of the most stupid sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and good choice for Mr. Halloran's work, Stanley! Afro-nymphomaniacs of black light really add to the mood and development of the character of a horror movie. Has a film already been shot further? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that I was finally able to get around this shit and accept that Kubricks 2001 is a really important movie, given the huge "bad will" generated at the times by this stupid and stupid film and by the worship of Kubrick fanatical fans impassive but inarticulate, who could not describe an idea at work with all the cinematographic resources of the Library of Congress before them. <br /> <br /> Get into Jack Nicholson's grotesque outbidding, the introduction of stupid one-liners at times of tension, and the performance of Shelly Duvall, nominated by Razzie, and you get a crappy movie .
