I gave these 3 stars out of 10 possible - because the stories are open and unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way, as well as scenes of a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above needs to be shown so graphically. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, concerns three connected stories that never end satisfactorily. . <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects the three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, who looks very crazy, as a wanted criminal who fled to Mexico to escape the law and the bounty hunter, when he crosses a border town and spot a girl in the sad salon interpreted by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of Hemingway's daughters, I do not know which one, playing on a western woman on the isolated border, goes to see a neighbor, a pretty redhead let's quickly realize she's in the badlands a little too long. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film goes to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, the final scene of the film completely exceeding the rational understanding.
