Question: how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration? Answer: turning it into an existential parable about alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc and the flood of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to treat the subject than to make a film about a middle class journalist, alienated in an existential way, a politician of the higher class, existentially alienated, his rich wife, alienated in an existential way, etc. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants seek political asylum in an unidentified Greek village near the borders. I suppose that Angelopoulos can show some social awareness while addressing the higher classes in existential conflict. I mean honestly, the scene where a senior army officer curses his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you throw up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can not be so bad, Angelopoulos is a master of cinematic art after all, right? False. That's when his manners start to become too artificial, much like a filtered image in Photoshop. Her usual tricks are: blurred windows, dim lights, strange wedding, riverside walk and people wearing a water jacket. Mastroianni also innovates for most sleepwalking performances of all time. Avoid really. Go for his first films.
