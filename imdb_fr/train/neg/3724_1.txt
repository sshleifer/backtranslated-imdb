I saw this film twice in a Pentecostal church that my family attended in Nanaimo, BC, in the 1970s. I was just 6 years old, my brother 4 years old, and then again when I was 8 years old. This film terrified my brother and me and shaped our mistrust of the world. It was not just the film, but it was also the philosophy that engulfed so many "Christians" about "the mark of the beast" and the kidnapping. This film, the church and a careless and volatile education lead to serious paranoia towards the future. For years, I lived under the delirious effects of the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. I went through years of counseling. Once, I explained to a psychiatrist this film and the belief system of the church and the family. I was anchored in a delusional disorder. In fact, I began to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this philosophy of worship had really occurred. I no longer fear the future, I have managed to accept the fear injected by the church into its members. I took this experience to accomplish a goal, I approach my license as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
