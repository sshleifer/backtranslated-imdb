And I mean ultra light. This movie features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing else. <br /> <br /> There is really not much to say about this stinker, aside from that, although it has some very good bits, most are not very funny. It does not work at all like a romance. How about a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most dialogs are way too flat to be sophisticated and much less fun. <br /> <br /> What is really crazy is that the premise is not bad at all. This film could have been much more, especially with all the recent efforts on some of the fake ways in which movies are promoted, supplemented by fake quotes from critics. The film unveils the untapped territory of the press - paid trips for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a joke, he devotes about three minutes to this territory and continues the lame romance of the film. <br /> <br /> Same with Catherine Zeta-Jones. character - the whinny movie star, egocentric. Zeta-Jones did a good job with what she gave, but she gave him almost nothing. It's a homogenized junk that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this cursed ship, which flows like a replay of "The Love Boat ". In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the contract. That would probably make a better story. So, go ahead, filmmakers, what do you have about these stars who made them appear?
