I have never read the book "A ride in time". To be quite honest, after watching the movie, do I really want it? Well, I should not go through this movie, I'll start with that. Then I will say that the TV movie is rather forgettable. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what's going on there. I told you it was forgettable. To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How to describe a TV movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, I'll just say that they usually have celebrities. A ride in time only includes one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), the winner of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The film has some nerdy special effects, a moderately interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are not usually good. As it is this one. A ride in time is a waste of time and a big waste of time. To top it off, you'll probably forget it the second it's over. Well, maybe not the second it's over. But in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A ride in time: * / ****
