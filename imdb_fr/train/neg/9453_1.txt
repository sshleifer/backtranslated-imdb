Holy cow, what piece of sh * t is this movie. I did not know how these filmmakers could turn a 250-word book into a movie. I guess they did not know either! I do not remember any farting or belching in the book, is it? <br /> <br /> They took this classic of all time for children, added farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted her in a joke of KAKA. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers are thinking about. I must say that visually, it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is spoiled by the humor of the toilet (if you even think that this kind of thing is funny), I do not want the children that I know think it . <Br /> <br /> Do not take your children to see, do not rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess Ghost will come and haunt the people who made this film.
