Nice attempt and good ideas (buy the prostitute, human assistance, ...) but poor result ... The director has obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an atmosphere supposed to portray Viet Nam ... only problem is that this Viet Nam is gone for a long time and that "The smell of the green papaya" had a historical past ... trying to project this type of atmosphere (muffled sounds and slowness of life ..) the modern days leaves a feeling of false. In addition, this quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang, because that's where Harvey Keitel, the ex-sailor of the movie, was probably stationed during the war ... But in the south of Viet Nam, nobody or very few people speak with the clip The North accent displayed by the actors ... Seriously strange, even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease for people of her condition), a peasant woman who can read and write an elaborate Vietnamese poetry, ... even more dubious. .. <br /> <br />
