Effort aside (not a criticism of good intentions, but of the final product), this film is poorly written, badly treated and poorly realized. The story obviously had potential, but this story is nowhere present in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-doubt, just like the rest of us. You would never know that from this movie about the performance of the main actress. In fact, this applies to all characters in the film, but in the case of Barton: every sentence is a speech. An epic above speech, like an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that goes well at a meeting of the board, and I understood that it is because it makes a speech! Every idea she has is amazing in its context and she has ideas that sound as if they are taking a lifetime of digging on the spot. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she will start pontificating the needs of the battlefield and protecting the soldiers and setting white flags and so on. As in the film, it can not in any case offer a thoughtful idea in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film steals Clara Barton from her difficulties. This deprives her of her humanity and it basically depreciates everything she did because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based her scenario on an article in Britannica encyclopedia. (yes, they had them at the time) But good technicolor! (we do not care)
