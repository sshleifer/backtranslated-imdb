I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my best judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that playing was a little ... weak (most of the time, I noticed it from the teenage boy's family). I mean, the screenplay was not great at first, but the actors did not make me believe the relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> loved. The characters are nice and the plot is neither provocative nor confusing. That's nice, the characters care about each other, and I do not count it as fifty badly spent minutes. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
