Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an elderly player, wins the teenager Wanda "Nevada" (pretty, but not talented, Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the improbable couple (of course) is looking for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there is really no need to look for a deeper meaning. It's just not there. The acting is also very weak, which was quite surprising given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the pretty landscape and some good looks from a young Brooke Shields. However, her character is so irritating (especially at first) and stupid that she never turns out to be so sexy or attractive. Too bad, but given the story, I doubt that we can do more. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and played in this film. He even had to talk to his father (Henry Fonda) about a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, it was their only movie together. Could not Henry be in EASY RIDER for example? 3/10
