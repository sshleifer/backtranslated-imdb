Twist terminations can be really cool in a movie. This is particularly interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. This type of twisted endings is the one that makes people think. Then we have twists like this movie has. Whether you care or not, you do not know what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's a somewhat stunned reaction. This film begins as an interesting horror, but after about 20 minutes, there remains only a boring dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert. get lost in the woods and bang against a tree trunk. They end up at a scary old lady, who hates men, and they are greeted by her little daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange things happen because these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or go home, and the suspense turns into a stupid slasher. <br /> <br /> This film is too taken in its dialogues, and it is always between some characters only. We have the three main girls, the old girl and the old lady, and the conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite annoying to sit in their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk. <br /> <br /> Plot holes are plentiful here. The house of these girls when they had their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere ... Wow, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill them. Why did not they go and get the worker for the household driving to town by car? Did he have a place? How is it that these girls never question the departure and stay voluntarily, rarely checking each other? Why should it have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a slasher movie with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the end is undoubtedly, but definitely stupid. <br /> <br /> My note: * 1/2 on **** 79 minutes R for nudity and violence.
