Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest English-language novels and this scriptwriter should read it. I hate when writers use Spark notes to describe a novel. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole "red room" is so played that I wonder why they bother to put it on. In the book, the "red room" is prefiguring for the ENTIRE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is so badly treated in the movie that I'm sure she was happy to die and leave earlier. In the book, she is one of the most convincing characters and she was not the redhead. He misses all the Christian theme in his life and in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this film and read the story as masterfully said Charlotte Bronte.
