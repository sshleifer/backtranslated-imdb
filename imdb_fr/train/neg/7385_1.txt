The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, the action is hilarious. This film is a big mess. It almost seems that when action music comes into play, the most impressive waterfall is running. The voice is doubled with Mr. McGregor where Steven sings too much and that changes his voice. There are far too many dialogues in this film, and extremely bad for everyone. The film is an excellent sleep therapy. The fights are laughable. The effect of changing the shape of the eyes on the evil designer female drug addicts was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was undeveloped. The main villain was used to explaining the story through interrogation, he was only throwing random intrigues such as (spoiler) "CTX (his synthetic drug) will be in the water supply", which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
