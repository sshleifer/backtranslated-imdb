I had high hopes for this film, because I thought that CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature film) was absolutely fantastic, the safest low-budget movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But CLAIRE DOLAN has a lot totally useless and flat. Scene after scene seems to be thrown at random in the mix, without thinking too much about the narrative or the character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape prostitution or not? Hard to say. Why did she pick up the torch at the airport if she wants to escape this life? Why does not she then turn when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair the same color? Why does Claire accept some clients and not others? The filmmaker does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It seems that everything is improvised (although I understand that it was not the case) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a true documentary. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning the narrative film as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a loophole. <br /> <br /> I am saddened that the director of a film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN continues to make a film as lame as this one, then to defend it wearily. old clich√©s "policies".
