The film was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even at the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the screenwriter can not hold the water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason to watch the film other than after a historical overview of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film lacks substance. The only way to do it well was to change the legend rather than a story. And a legend will include some elements that will try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, and so on. It is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> Movie fails answer, why should I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, psychic king or eccentric king such as "The King and I" would have been charming, would have added much to the appeal of the movies. I guess there was no recourse other than a simple vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> Once the call is made, history is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call this "must see". Hearing the film's title, people would say: Oh, I have to see it. Now where is the call in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, "How not to be a king?" and make a black comedy from the old Siamese era, in the manner of "Dr. Strangelove". It would have been a lot more interesting. Narrative experiences of the king of blunder's weaknesses would have made the film extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Today, most movies have this "must see" appeal, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, other films like The Island have had a recourse in themselves when the advertisement asked "Do you still believe that there is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or for the film, the title "How to NOT be a king" could ask the question: "So, do you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
