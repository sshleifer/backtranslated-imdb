After Mafia boss Vic Moretti (the late Anthony Franciosa) killed his lady who cheated on him with Derek, their new driver / veterinarian from Vietnam, and blamed the poor guy, Derek finds himself in jail where he has to fight corrupt guardian, Vic's prisoner brother who runs the jail and, oh yeah, unlawful experiments conducted by a lousy agent of the CIA (big boss of the genre and first director, John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into invincible zombies superhuman. Of course, things get out of hand and it is up to Derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the incarceration of the infected. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor & as a director, Saxon is ... a talented actor. To say that this film (John's only release to date) lacks a certain visual flair would be an understatement. However, the film is not totally without merit. Dialogue, even if it's silly, is just hard enough to be funny at times. Unfortunately, this is not really enough for the film to miss out on that and it takes forever for the film to start appearing (which is quite late in the film). As such, the best I can recommend to this movie is to say that if you're a Saxon fan (which I actually am), it's worth watching, just enter with low expectations and it should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure become topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
