This is the kind of movie that leaves you an impression .. The story writing is the subject of the making of a movie. <br /> <br /> Amazing visual effects .. Very good acting, especially Shue. Everything is perfect .. Except that .. The story is just mediocre and everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you had the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of nothing but stroking and raping women ... that's all his so-called "genius" spirit could imagine. Is he trying to gain extra power? No, he does not even look for a way to become visible again. The guy is basically a crazy maniacal sex. <br /> <br /> Add to that the laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. Run jokes as if they were in a bar .. If it was not for all the white coats and l equipment, you might think it's a bad imitation of "Cheers". Very superficial and poor personalities and very little attention are given for you to think that these guys are nothing but lambs for the hollow man's wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the film is far too short "thrilling scenes" are written so badly and are full of illogical behavior on the part of actors who just shout "it's just a stupid thing that I must do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> If you read the book itself, while the scientist (Cane) attacks women , his character undergoes many mental manipulations and disturbing thoughts. In the film, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded market to rub his body to women and pick on him. Just sad.
