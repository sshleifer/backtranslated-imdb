After surviving the previous opus of the Nightmare series, I will find Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams again. This time, the insulting murderer crosses the sleeping spirit of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be reborn" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is her dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? This movie started really well when we see Alice dream of being Amanda Kruger who gets stuck in the room and gets raped by 100 Manics, then she is taken to the hospital but she is no longer the pregnant woman but she gives birth to Freddy again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people to come back from the 4th movie and then have new friends, not until Freddy starts killing again, I loved the first ones, okay , not as good as other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself did not seem at all scary in this movie, the nightmares were just boring really they were not scary or scary at all. <br /> <br /> Playing in a movie was good for a 5th movie in the series but overall, I think this movie was really dull. (Still not the worst movie of the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
