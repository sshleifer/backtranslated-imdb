This direct duffer to the video is another highlight in the coffin of Rick Moranis' career. As is the tradition of Disney, quality is sacrificed in the name of a fast cashing; This is a lazy retreading with Moranis accidentally narrowing as well as a few family members so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and unhealthy dialogues abound in this cheese idiot, which only made me go crazy at the time of "The Incredible Shrinking Man," when that kind of thing was done right. The director of photography, Dean Cundey, must realize this in a shocking way. He should either stay true to his day job or choose a better subject next time.
