This film must be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the film misleads the public into believing there may be hope. The scenario of the film is at best laughable, with such a mediocre acting game that you just have to cringe. The title 'Zombie Nation' involves a treasure of zombies while there are six in total. This can not be called a horror movie because of the introduction of the old-fashioned 80's music during the zombie attack. The zombies speak and act like human beings in the movie, the only difference being the makeup that looks like a video of La Roux. If you ever have the chance to buy this movie, do it, then burn the copy.
