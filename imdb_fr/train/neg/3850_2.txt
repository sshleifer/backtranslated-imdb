I saw this film at SXSW in the presence of the director. A lot of people came out and the audience could barely applaud, even politely, in the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I saw at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> With 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes too much. You can see the main player's communication attempts that have failed and failed, in real-time extended. The same grimaces, mouth movements, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables again and again - WE GET THE POINT. <br /> <br /> A site actually compares this work to Mike Leigh. What medications do you need to take to make this statement? Since Frownland is a song by Captain Beefheart, you should be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica in intense rotation to enjoy this movie. Incredibly, it won a jury prize at the festival. You can bet that it did not win a public prize.
