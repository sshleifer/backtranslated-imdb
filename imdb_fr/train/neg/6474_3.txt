It was the first suite I had seen (except Return of Jafar) and I sincerely thought, before looking at it, that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was, by and large, the first scenario with a few extra characters and the situation changed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not satisfied with life on earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody discovers she is upset and angry. And she decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid. She is happy to swim and Ariel is about to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not sound too badly written, but the clich√©s and the repetitions of situations of the first film are all too obvious. And adding that Melody is, on the whole, extremely annoying, and that the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also a host of other new characters, including Tip and Dash. They are not so bad as characters in themselves - just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just do not have the same magical energy as the songs of the original. It is obvious that the animation did not contain a considerable workload. In part, it is unstable and the movements of the characters are unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Another tip, try to forget The original character of Ariel watching this movie. The beautiful rebellious and curious teenager has become a boring and boring woman and mother, and her red hair is all tied up. It's better seen if you've never seen the original - you have nothing to compare it. <br /> <br /> However, overall, it could have been worse - it's not as bad as some of the other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But this is nothing more for your collection than if Disney continues like this, they will lose all their older fans.
