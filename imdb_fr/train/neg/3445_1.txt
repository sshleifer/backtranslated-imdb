When young Kevin receives a boat from his dead uncle, he invites five of his friends to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. During the trip, they drink alcohol, have sex and play games, each telling their biggest fear. Later, Kevin drowns at sea, the engine stops and they are haunted and murdered by their biggest fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, my son, my daughter and three other friends joined them to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of animation, the band stopped watching this messy and boring amateur shit, and we decided to see another movie. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this film to see how serious it could be and that it would have been better to go to bed to sleep. The confusing story has a horrendous cinematographic and photographic work, with a cast that probably studies to become actors and actresses and in the end, this film seems to be a bad film school project. The terrible and pretentious scenario shows a ridiculous twist in the end, makes it a complete mess that made me understand not what the story is about. Was the girl crazy and traveling alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If this is true, is their friend again at the end of her madness? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Journey to Death")
