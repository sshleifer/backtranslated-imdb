Simply terrible! Why not use real actors? Look, it must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want a credibility or a message sent via these low-budget movies ... please, for the sake of the gods, use real actors! Most will work for free ... enjoy! Now, back to my comment ... anyway, the humor was inferior to that of the bathroom variety and was not funny at any level. As for the quality ... in a scene filmed on a public transport bus, you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? He was a guy with what looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I guess the only audience for this movie is people with a gore fetish ... and it was not even good gore.
