It was one of the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST anti-nuclear movies of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a kid and a basketball star could "change the world" is rather farfetched, counts given the number "peace marches for children" and "celebrity events" existed and were. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would accept a nuclear disarmament TOTAL, because some children of appatchatchik have learned the existence of a "silent demonstration" in The West, c is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What brought an end to the cold war? In America, dare to say "Reaganesque" and the internal failures of socialism. These are NOT peace marches, die-in or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
