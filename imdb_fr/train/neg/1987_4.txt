It was a great idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed a little dull. Set It Off meets the West. The plot did not make much sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. Perhaps there were also useless things that did not concern the plot or contributed to the advancement of history. There were also long white moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The scenario should have been more logical as well as the staging. I had a big question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just looking in the eye, this movie is for you.
