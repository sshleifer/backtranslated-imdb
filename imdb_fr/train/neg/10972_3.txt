It was not a Trainspotting film or Guy Ritchie. It was a big wannabee. He wanted to be an edgy film, a nervous laugh, an urban affirmation, but it's more like a camera jerk, a mess. It is much easier to imitate something other than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I made fun of the characters and their involvement. They beat each other, pissed or cried. Only, there was no substance to what they were doing. The dialogue between the characters is supposed to be connected, revealing. Instead, it seems banal and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers who really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
