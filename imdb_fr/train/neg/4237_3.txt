JUDAAI was a daring film of Raj Kanwar in his time In 1997, when such a subject was damn unusual, <br /> <br /> To pay tribute to him, he managed to show how greed changes a person and how far no one can get what they want <br /> <br /> The film is melodramatic, many ridiculous places <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil does not buy television for his wife? When does he win so much? Just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The twist is well managed, but the manipulation comes straight from the 80s. The comedy Johny-Paresh entertaining here and there stands out as if it was not part of the story. > <br /> Even if there are several crazy scenes <br /> <br /> The staging of Raj Kanwar is adequate, although sometimes too melodramatic. <br /> <br /> Anil plays his role well. Sridevi is excellent. Urmila is decent. Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent.
