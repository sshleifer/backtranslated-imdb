80 minutes, and it was twice as long! Brief Crossing is not brief enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue (rather a monologue, in reality) of a woman approaching middle age, painfully hissing about "men", deception, sex, aging and her recent breakup, with a French teenager whom she met at the ship's cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The tedious monologue continues as they go to a duty free shop and a bar where, finally, his authoritarian speech repels him. "The story" can not stop there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to his drone further as she takes him to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What a little romance, what kind of sex or elsewhere All that this film has more, besides bitter speeches, is barely enough to justify the price of a rental, unless that you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens. Yes, the end is very well done, but it is little rewarded to submit to what amounts to transforming her living room into a session of virtual therapy with a narcissistic groan. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like it. I could be wrong.
