Oh my God ... There are so many other movies that I want to see there ... I found myself stuck with my nephew over the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yes .. I was watching this show when I was in college ... it was stupid, rather fun and action oriented. The series had a good heart but ... and the characters were cute; no one has ever been killed or even wounded ... it's as if a cartoon is coming alive. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have already said, there's just not a consistent story and the performances are weird ... almost boring - certainly not faithful to the original characters ... it's all like a skit Mad TV and lasts more than 100 minutes! It was one of the few times I was EMBARRASSÃ‰ watching a movie. What were they thinking? As far as I know, this must have been for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is that he dies quickly. This gives the original Dukes of Hazzard the look of Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remake left to do is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
