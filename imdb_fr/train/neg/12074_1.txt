A ridiculous horror movie about a rich man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be divided equally. One condition - they must spend a week in his estate to get money. And if one of them dies, the others get more. Guess what will happen next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new impression of this movie on cable. The colors were bright and vibrant and the house itself was beautiful. That's about all I can say positive about it. <br /> <br /> Let's list some of the problems this movie has: The killer is loud and obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga - go! certain sound recordings were so bad that I could not discern the dialogue (without much loss, I am sure) the blood was lean and very badly done; the other murders were just boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly awful actors - so bad that you stare at the screen in disbelief. Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only good enough role was done by the troop Faith Domergue (who deserved better than that) and John Carradine (who looks terribly old and frail here). However, I must admit that the conclusion of this film is a jewel! <br /> <br /> The reason he was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me. There is another 1978 horror movie with this name! Whatever his name is, it's a bad movie. To avoid at all costs.
