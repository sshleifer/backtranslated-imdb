I am an actor, producer, director and what I am about to say are facts. This project was the worst film in the history of cinema. From producer to director and editing this movie is a joke and I mean a big joke. Why would Blockbuster have released such shit? I take my job very seriously and this film is an insult to my job. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad movies of zombies, but it takes the coffee cake and everything on the damn table. This film is bad !!! I really hate talking bad about other filmmakers because I'm one myself, but please consider changing jobs. I respect the fact that you have finished a film, but I have to ask you: "SMOKING IT SMOKE?" For the whole nation, if I had been able to vote zero, I would have. THE WORST FILM IN THE FILM MAKING HISTORY !!!
