This movie has a very simple plot but somehow very bad. The whole movie is about a girl being sucked by a door to another dimension and then, a few years later, she is reopened by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor who has trouble to overcome her ex-girlfriend who is one of the other campers with her new partner ... another girl ... it's true that they are lesbians and that there is nudity of course without specific reason). Unfortunately, the demon follows the now grown-up girl. In addition, unfortunately, none of this is explained. Where exactly were they? Where does the devil come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell formed her and made her a gladiator-type outfit? The acting game is terrible I think but it's hard to say because the writing is so bad maybe there was nothing they could do with it. I give him a three because the wrestler was very good and the effects were fun enough even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not serious enough to be funny.
