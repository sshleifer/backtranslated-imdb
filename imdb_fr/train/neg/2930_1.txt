I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I love almost all British sitcoms (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were excellent, but I did not understand some of them.), But this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick. This show was good in a way; it helped me lose weight because looking at that garbage makes me feel like I'm no longer hungry. It's really just disgusting, sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who really laughs at this stuff. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting to watch men dressed in a yellow-toothed woman and urinate on the car ... I mean ... What's so funny about it ??? It makes me want to vomit. No humor, just disturbing pictures and cheap, the toilet laughs ... I do not know ... if you like this stuff ... go ahead ... look at it ... but for to be honest, people watch and enjoy it must have emotional issues. Garbage.
