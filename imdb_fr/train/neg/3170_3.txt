There have been some fun movies about the spirits in Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course, the best were the Topper films in the late '30s and early' 40s. And, most recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" These were well-written, entertaining and entertaining comedies, all centered around supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes screenwriter-director Jeff Lowell, who debuts in feature film Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), a young bitch who gets killed on her wedding day and then returns for harass the young Spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell) who falls for Kate's fiance, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing is clear at first: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films of "Topper"), which is the standard against which all ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There is a line from the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane), says to Henry, "You're not smiling." This has well described my situation throughout this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the script is just not very funny. But the presence of Longoria Parker only makes things worse, because it only rubs me every time it appears on the screen. For starters, aggravating her lack of comedy talent, she's covered in makeup for pancakes, who knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed by preparing her wedding with a frozen statue falling. She is so unreasonable that the angel who informs her of what is happening beyond her life is leaving her (well, she is actually fading away), so Kate finds herself on earth as a ghost without knowing what is his mission. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry out of the funk in which he naturally descended after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she present it to Ashley, who really does not know it. I do not know what she does as a spiritualist (she's also a caterer to make ends meet), to see if she can restore Henry's touch with Kate. There are a lot of meshugaas going on. <br /> <br /> The emptiness of the film is summed up by a story "B" that revolves around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is added almost at the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates she is as silly as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to these two seriously deficient women, he deserves all he has. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kate appears to Ashley and the pleasure should begin. This is not the case, and especially since it is a pity, because it could have been quite funny between other hands. In this case, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. must turn in their grave to see that this is what their brilliant in the first two films of "Topper" has succeeded.
