In the first three seasons, Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as a hard, lively, sweet and addictive candy. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you'll need after watching the most recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence causing no laughter. Cosmo, who once was one of Nick's most endearing characters, has evolved into a funny little moron that the Family Guy cast would not even want to know. Timmy has become a selfish and arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would gladly rid himself of snot (and considering Timmy's trap, it would take a lot of blows). And poor Wanda ... a charming victim of her husband and goddaughter, she is now called "gruff" to worry about the well-being of others. Moreover, Cosmo's stupidity hurts everyone, but he never punished him and learned no lessons. Which pretty much sums up Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are crude, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God, that shabby toon has been canceled, as well as Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
