This film is considered by some to be a classic - I do not know why. It's terrible to the point of being laughable. The only thing that saves through this movie is the cheese lines that are so embarrassing that you have no choice. movie, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is located in a theater without change of scenery and Michael Douglas is still depressing. One day, my brother forced me to watch this movie, because he said I could not believe how bad a movie could become! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally, with such a dreadful movie, I recommend people not to watch it, but in this case, I think people should, because that will put all the other bad movies you have seen In perspective.
