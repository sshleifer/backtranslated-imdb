A cannibal killer from the undergrowth is on the lookout and two bickering couples could be his next source of protein in this cheap basement on Friday, July 13th. There is literally nothing interesting to see in this one, the murders are surprisingly rare and when they happen, they are completely amateurish. He also adds ghosts to the mix for no reason. I felt exhausted after looking at her as if my brain was liquefying and draining my nose. And that's definitely the worst Donald Jones movie. If you are thinking of renting it because of Code Red's new DVD release, do not hesitate <br /> <br /> My rating: F
