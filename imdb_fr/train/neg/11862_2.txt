This movie probably had potential for something; What puzzles me is how these totally prosaic and totally prosaic themes arrive in theaters, it's as if ideas are recycled simply because the generations are. In fact, the films that are disconnected behind most of the movies are like dogs, they come back to ingest their own vomit. Well, they are 19 dollars richer now because of me. It was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, something funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing fun was in the trailer), the performances were tense (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be a comic relief was the homoerotic friend who had a penchant for Disney movies; none of his analogies hit the house, his little moral speeches were flat, I literally waited for them to continue to say something meaningful, only to find out he was finished. The so-called "hard 10" is the most tasteless plastic creature there is (aside from having a horse face with a strange smile); Honestly, I found her friend Patty (called Hamburglar) much more beautiful than her. But again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, anyway, the premise is that society is superficial and that if love is true, it transcends all social facades; the way they showed it, with one guy shaving another's scrotum and the mutilated and beaten-to-death premature ejaculation routine that's a million times (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the last in the denouement the dog of the family). I feel as if the movie was like ridiculous jokes juxtaposed in a ball of untrained and poorly formed sewage. Will show that marketing can push anything, shine whatever the foul mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Made with tirade.
