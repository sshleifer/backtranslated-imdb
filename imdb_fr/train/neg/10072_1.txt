Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros to the movies to watch this film without meaning. My points; <br /> <br /> The film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic point of view: as in most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately, that is not enough. Knowing kunefe and two other food names does not allow a person to understand a culture. For example, shaving is a sign of healthy living in Asia, but everyone was trying to get the girl to stop it. The Lebanese are Christians (they understand it) and their cultural forms, their beliefs and their approaches are completely different from those of other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not do ethnocentrism. So, we do not judge people after their first question about our lives as did the father figure in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual revolution of a girl: there is nothing to say about it. Show me 10 girls who had this at their waking sex that I will say that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the genre of black humor. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the sense of black humor. A dark humor must reflect the truth and guide the audience to the most fun parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film?
