Although there is a repertoire of over 180 films, this "Succube" is often referred to as Jess Franco's best film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang is one of his favorites Succubus. So maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly annoying film and too confusing. The beginning is great, however, and shows Janine Reynaud playing a SM number on stage. Unfortunately, everything is downstream. The character of Reynaud is a maneater that ends up killing his lovers in a kind of trance. Franco had a reasonable budget to work and spent well in beautiful places, beautiful photographs and a haunting score. It could have been his biggest film indeed, if not for this lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic but I would say that sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what's going on or what's being said. Even the short duration of 80 minutes seems to last very long. It's certainly not Franco's best film in my opinion. I would not even recommend it to hardcore people. If you are looking for a top quality movie, Jess Franco, try to get your hands on "Las Vampiras", "The Dreadful Dr. Orloff" or "Female Vampire".
