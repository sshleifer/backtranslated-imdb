*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> While LIVING AT TOKYO TIME was a daring experience in which actors wanting to be experienced received parts of the film, provided they were forced to take a combination of powerful anti-anxiety drugs, anti-depressant drugs and antipsychotics (this is the classic psychological combo that turns patients into drooling zombies) throughout the filming, this film would then arouse a lot more interest. Or, if film production was another type of experience where all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with actors who are lifeless and low energy. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs and chatting with his sister, he seemed to have trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene, he pronounces his lines sitting with every part of his motionless body. From beginning to end, his facial expression is better described as "almost asleep". <br /> <br /> Do not worry about actors talking to each other, because they can not finish tinkering with lines of dialogue. Everyone speaks in a depressing and monotonous voice. Do not laugh. No screaming. No force. Nobody has enough energy to smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And that does not help that the direction is simple and amateurish. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at any cost. Better to look at GREENCARD who has a similar terrain and who has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese love story, check out THE LONG VACATION which contains a sufficient amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not have.
