Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema purists chokes on their lattes, let me elaborate. Although I liked it, it's simply one of the worst films I've ever seen and it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema (an impressive statement, because I remember have seen Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright terrible at worst. Of course, they were not helped by a scenario as deeply emotional as a single by Daphne & Celeste and a characterization about as convincing as the defense of the Olympics. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin, if not non-existent, and the "gore" scenes, although without a doubt brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously formulated. The plot is centered around a model of twenty years (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The scenes of torture give the impression of being disconnected plays and the emphasis was on shocking rather than frightening the audience. Although there are really very few positives from this film, its reductive features are the very flaws that make it such a terrible film. I have never heard such a vocal audience in a movie theater. In less than twenty minutes, all the cinema was scrambled and remained. For my part, I came out laughing, carried by a movie that had reached the pinnacle of making dreadful movies. Whatever your point of view, this is truly a cinematographic feat and a model for future filmmakers, detailing how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I failed to mention that I managed to get into the movie for free ... so I could afford to laugh about it. I was always tempted to ask for my money back ... it was SO MUCH.
