Hello Tristesse addresses a topic similar to "The Wedding Member". that is, a possessive girl tries to prevent the creation of a relationship between a loved family member and an intruder. While critics adore "Marriage Member", I find Julie Harris a giant star and a dramatic adenoid in all she has experienced. It portrays rich and irritating idiots like last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue. <br /> <br /> In this film Preminger, the sequences develop, but not the characters. For the first 30 minutes, he is content to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making possible uncomfortable sexual readings. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not provide the depth required by the piece. Kerr pulls the rank and turns the film into "Endless Love". Seberg's empty narration looks like something coming out of Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really hope someone other than Niven is in his role. He spends so much time normalizing the British orthodox behavior in all his films that he never gets to understand the character. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> In the most memorable sequence, a dance party becomes a mat in a port. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, "The Conformist". Kerr is on board to shake his hands and represent another major pain (as in Black Narcissus, The Night of the Iguana, King and Me, Heaven Knows, Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every film with her could end in a fatal car accident or, better yet, by one. <br /> <br /> Uncomfortable people with ambiguity should avoid this.
