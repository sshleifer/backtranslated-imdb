I do not see what's funny in this film. Humor seems to be destined for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not arouse much sympathy, with some unimportant characters. Nothing surprising happens. What did the authors of this script think? "Oooo, fun! Let's make the old lady has a lot of success! Let them ... pouffons! Let them ... act like little children !! Oooo, yes, it is absolutely brilliant and original! " <br /> <This film upset me most of all the movies I've seen over the last five years.
