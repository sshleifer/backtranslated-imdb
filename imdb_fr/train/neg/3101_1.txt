This scam of the movie "Gremlins" of 1984 is probably the biggest wreck of a movie. Even for a category "B" movie, all the other cheap horror movies on the same platform are completely dwarf in this film in terms of plot, acting and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with an old security guard and the young punky security guard whose name does not matter. Why? A few minutes after the beginning of the film, he enters the safe "forbidden" and is killed while living his fantasy rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just an appetizer for the scat. main course filled. The main character, KEVIN, struggles several times to prove that he is more than a total cat. Perhaps he succeeds in the film, but for the public, he turns out to be a bad actor. Kevin finds himself working with the old security guard and is guided in his security work in the abandoned studio. Yes, why bother creating a set when you can use the studio itself? Back to the movie Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. Hobgoblins force people to live their wildest fantasies and then kill them for whatever reason. They must be returned before sunrise or otherwise ... otherwise what? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters include NICK, the friend of Kevin's "macho" army, and Nick's "wife," DAPHNE, whose character has no more substance that an attitude of prostitute slut and dresses worthy of the prostitute. There's Kevin's reserved and reserved girlfriend, AMY, whose deepest desire is seemingly to look like a dear Cher's look-alike with fishnet stockings topped with a pair of blue underwear. Do not ask me how it works. KYLE is without doubt the most entertaining character of all. How are these groups of friends made? Kyle is a perverted group that can not stay an hour without stimulating himself. Her hobby is to make sex calls from other people's homes and sniff underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in search of Hobgoblins heroes: knee-high creatures (or puppets in hand) who, for whatever reason, try not to travel further than the neighborhood boundaries. Each character ends up living his craziest fantasy that has nothing to do with millions of dollars ... nor with a large budget. The film has a huge budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING: FOR THE ATTENTION OF SPOILERS: The twist at the end of this film will leave the observer wondering "what?". The Hobgoblins are sent back to the safe ... of their own free will. Maybe they lost patience waiting for the sunrise to take their toll, or maybe the writers had the cramp of the writer and decided not to worry about the end. Back in the safe, the former security guard reveals "What he learned in the army" and explodes explosives that destroy the safe, signaling the end of evil Hobgoblins and the end of this mountain Russian. best suited for a walk in an escalator. <br /> <br /> The pure curse of this film is enough to make someone cry. If you plan to watch it, I recommend you in advance to take some alcoholic beverages to avoid serious reflection on the film.
