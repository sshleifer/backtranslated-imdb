It is true. A film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have been more aware after working on the sets of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'.) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are scientists, forest rangers and a chick with huge fake tits. They are all very bad at work, including the sexy girl (who, I think, is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the rangers said the scientists were "professionals", which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional worms, jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They roam the woods looking for strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentions that these bones could be those of the famous Bigfoot. They walk and one of the rangers strikes without hesitation the hottie. We all hope that he will die very soon (with his sister who is supposed to be the naive cutie but who is really boring). Then they sighed, found a Sasqu ... I mean, an animal-like cemetery. Of course, no one mentions that they may be Bigfoot bones they play with ... I guess scientists and rangers do not think about that stuff. <br /> <br /> Then, Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we do not like, hunt down the other losers and bury his great aunt Muriel and cousin Josh again (deceased after an unfortunate trout accident). <br /> <br /> Tasteless and boring dialogue (I have zoned several times), absurd plot, characters that are not alike, bad CGI (a man in monkey costume would do better), and play what does not was just not very good helps to make a movie that I will not watch again. <br /> <br /> You check it well; it's good for some unintentional laughs.
