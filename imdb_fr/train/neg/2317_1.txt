The management had clearly indicated that the idea and the plot of this film were totally original .... However, for those who read the comic "slam dunk", we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even jokes ... <Another note is that Jay Chow himself DOES NOT KNOW Kung Fu, it will not impress anyone if he tries to act as he can, many people today can see the differences. Fortunately the film does not contain Much of the fights of KunG Fu and a lot of enchantments and visual effects will enchant ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's game is always painful to watch , especially when almost everyone in the movie is really better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply because of his popularity. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the time I want to prevent anyone from watching this, what makes this "original" film what it should not be. have, it has become one of the best budget movies in China for this year.
