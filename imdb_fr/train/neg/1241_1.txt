This is the worst movie I've seen in years! It starts ridiculous and continues in the same way. I think something is going to happen in this movie and the acting is worse. The end lifts it up a bit and saves the film from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry, Tim Burton Batman was good but this one is bad.
