I took this at the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like it, go for it yourself!") On the box ... seemed like a resounding endorsement .. I was expecting something a bit more like "Death Proof" ... not a lot of real violence in this one, or in the plot, in the character or in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. Everything is there. Cascades and rock. It comes and goes. A week or so in the life of an LA group doing a crappy magic show, at a level you might see in one of the Strip's smaller casinos, and a new Australian stuntman in town who finds his feet ... They work, they meet girls, they celebrate. End of the story. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that the band needed all this, because they are frankly second and play a style that was already dated 1978. It must be said that the cascades of the film are really thorny - this Australian man is really something, and the film seems largely motivated by the love and respect of "art". I hung him there to see what crazy thing he would do next. I just hope he could have found a better vehicle.
