First, let me tell you that I am SDJ or rather, I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave him the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something that redeems in every movie I watch. And this one is no exception. He has his moments of redemption. But they are rare. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me a lot was that it seemed like Halestorm was ashamed of our church! In the LDS church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is in the "cultural room". NEVER ONCE, are any of these two names mentioned. The Church is never mentioned by name and "the norms" are as important as they evoke what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> This makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS aspirants or LDS aspirants? This movie had so much potential! It could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was only slightly entertaining and left a lot to be desired. If I was not already SDJ, I would still think that Mormons are stupid, idiots and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a movie I will recommend to my non-LDS friends. <br /> <Sorry, Halestorm. You can do better than this!
