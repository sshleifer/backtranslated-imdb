I was happy to watch this movie for free because I was working in the hotel industry. This film has recently arrived in our film library. Nothing against low-budget movies, but this movie has horrible play and direction. How to make a movie like this? The director should be blacklisted, and for all poor actors, it is certainly not a stepping stone for a career. Make sure you do not watch this movie, the acting is nothing, the camera and the staging are terrible. There are just a few more movies that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give it to charity, so at least it's good for a reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would watch it again 10 (or at least one more time).
