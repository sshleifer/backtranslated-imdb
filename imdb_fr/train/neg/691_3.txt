This one probably does not fit in the barrel of Slasher's mediocre films, but it's probably a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> The location of Holiday made it rather interesting but after the first scenes, the film shows that it is mediocre. production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, the subgenre was right now all about an invisible maniac cutting off teens for no apparent reason, but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no consistency in events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> The clichés are more than boring, the gore is minimal, just like the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty mediocre slasher that should not be put forward even if it has a nasty video label. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this piece of overrated basket.
