They show this on some off-network. That's good shit. Although it's not as serious as the B-series movies they air on Saturday on the science fiction network, it's still a big pile of shit. The acting is passable. The plot and the writing are pretty sub-standard and the pace is quite too slow. Every minute of the film is like part of the movie where things end before the credits - not the top of the film, the ending. In addition, large parts of the cast look very old for the age range they play. Everything is predictable, boring and does not deserve to be watched. Save your time. This is not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.
