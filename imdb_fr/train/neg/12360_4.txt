Why would a person return to a person who will kick him in the teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that to find love, we must accept to abuse (not only to forgive, but to accept it fully). Gosh! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. I obviously did not kiss my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As a writing debut at Bucatinsky, this film has many wonderful aspects; however, to justify the meeting of Eli and Tom, it would have been useful to further develop the character. We never know the masochism of Eli. In fact, we are led to believe that he is not masochistic, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
