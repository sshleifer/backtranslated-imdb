Okay, so I'm an original fan of Wicker Man and I do not usually like British movies made by Americans. So why, why did I experience the most painful movie experiences of all time? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I may have had some kind of crazy moment? The movie was appalling! The strand at the beginning of the crash / fire was irrelevant to the film and the policewoman knew where Edward was heading, so the draft at the end with the two girls visiting the continent, well that would not have the case was not investigated. The story behind the wicker man has not been really explored - and I suppose that being established in America did not really help the pagan theme as a whole. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best thing was right at the end, when Nicolas Cage is in flames! I am in such desperate need to review the original now, to clean up my disappointed soul. I really can not emphasize how disappointing this film is. Do not see it please: <br /> <br /> A) Do not like British remixes from British Films B) Are you a fan of the original? C) The hatred of Nicolas Cage
