Field blade and two-dimensional script made the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, it made it difficult to empathize with the characters, especially the fiance; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, I guess you could say that it lived up to your typical fiction film. He uses almost all the clichés of the book. The tortured classical musician who wants to go out and play salsa. The free spirit fiancée is engaged in a "bean counter" personality that she does not like. I will not list them, otherwise it would be a spoiler because I would give all the plot. The dance was ok but nothing special. I saw worse. 3 stars for good music. The group was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay much money to see him at the theater. I am still a little shocked by the number of positive reviews of this film.
