This miserable movie is a remake of a 1927 film. They should have let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks has absolutely no charisma. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role of true fool and Bette Grable sings with a chorus - What I will do to this Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot consists of an image of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Let's move on to 300 years later, where Grable, who has just married Count Romero, is facing a similar situation. On a wedding night, she is invaded by Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and runs away before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is forced to stay at the castle when his violin pleases Fairbanks. The end is worse than the miserable film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news: Romero enraged canceled the wedding. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a movie dates from 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran of support who is in, died in 1949; it must have been his last film. What a bomb to go out after such a distinguished career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is in the same role as the co-star but he can not do much with such a mediocre writing. The costumes are more like those from the Stone Age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
