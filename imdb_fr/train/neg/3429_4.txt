I had a copy of the author of this movie on Soulseek. I must say that it's pathetic and just painful to watch the two cops play, but I watched the movie as a joke and as it's a tribute to the August underground that I saw in my book like a great movie. Its quality and everything about it is rather bad, but it is entertaining and can be discussed with your friends. It reminds me of troma but good stuff. I recommend seeing this under two conditions, if you are bored and need to laugh, or laugh, otherwise let it be. Recommended download for sure. o and the killings are pretty funny. like when the zombie tears Satan's followers and stabs them with a bullet in the head.
