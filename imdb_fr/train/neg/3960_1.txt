Hello, Maybe because I'm not a movie major or a sophisticated viewer ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but my boy, what a waste of time ... I'm just watching 2 guys sitting in a chest and talk ... <br /> <br /> The movie on this DVD was so "dark" ... that I had trouble watching the movie ... I realize it's a movie of 1968 ... but they put it on a DVD, so they should do a digital remastering. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was totally surprised to see these high ratings on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before, I'm not as sophisticated as the other people who have commented on this film earlier
