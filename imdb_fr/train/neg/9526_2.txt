At the time I rented videos for free, I chose this one. OOPS The things I wanted to mention apart from the summary already given are these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was rude and useless. 2: There is a kind of soundtrack in the background of the movie that seems to be there all the time and the way I felt for days after watching this trash, I told myself that there was something subliminal in the track. Either that or it was just traumatic, or both. You can see many times that the screenwriter and the director do not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about acting.
