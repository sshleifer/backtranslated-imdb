It's a horrible disaster of a movie. From beginning to end, he is filled with bad acting and worse direction and editing. Streisand contains only a few parts of the film that redeem the film, as it is impossible to watch or listen to Kristofferson's parts. The main problem of this film is that we never see the Kristofferson character at its peak, nor the character of Streisand in trouble. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final issue of Streisand could have been one of the finals of the film, had it been made and edited correctly. The only framed shot of his face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the group, the audience and the broad shots of the scene had been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been made and edited by a young girl from the film school of New York University. The worst thing is perhaps the miserable scenario. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is completely missed by unwise technical decisions.
