A girl is raining without knowing that a serial rapist is looking at her through the skylight. Inspectors Martin Manners and Orville Stone are on his trail, but not enough, as they find him after he kills, rapes and eats the girl's nipple. This is the mortal blow. We hope it will be the end of the film. Not because it's too horrible, but because the level of play is horribly horrible. Unfortunately, this is not the end and months later, the rapist is resurrected like a zombie by a group of satanists. So he continues where he stopped, with the detectives again, this time a flying baby is following him too (do not ask). There have been very good movies with a very small budget (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty come to mind), but this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. A horrible action game, dubious special effects, a lame comedy attempt and oh yeah, and an end that also fears. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul becomes completely naked; Anne R. Key becomes topless
