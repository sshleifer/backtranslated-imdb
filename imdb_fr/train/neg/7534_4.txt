A mom tells vignettes about men, women and sex between them. Huh? In the beginning, the mummy asks the viewer: "Imagine having sex with this girl, imagine having sex with this boy" about 37 times, while displaying images of young, half-naked teenagers. Later, boys of mods skinned girls with vegetables? If you ignore (or fast forward) in mother's discussions, shorts are not bad in themselves. I found some rather funny. My favorite is when the man, sexually confused, tries to convince a girl to have sex with her while her lizard is resting on the bed. It's a, well, a weird movie.
