This film was designed for television. Therefore, I will not go as hard as in a feature film. The scenario is mediocre, but he manages to be slightly humorous in places, whether it is or not. The acting is usually exaggerated, but this is the case for many low-budget films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated, was that 90 to 95% of it was shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can see it because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly at 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second of the film. I do not know if these scenes should perhaps be shot later and at that time, they did not have the money to shoot in a movie (I guess that's why, anyway), but it disorients and really makes the film more mediocre. Anyway, I certainly have seen worse movies, but I certainly would not say that I liked this movie and I can not recommend anyone to see it.
