Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20-second cameos and what does Barry do in the movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! It's a movie that makes no sense. The inept writer / director (the same man) slaughtered everyone's talent with his horrible work ... uh. I had the DVD for a penny, so I can not complain! But it's weird! And it makes you feel weird and not in a good way. It was in the '70s and the manager seemed to have a bad trip with acid and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be in his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly becomes dangerous. It has this atmosphere "Manson family on acid". <br /> <br /> I do not know at all how the other reviewer made the most of the movie? Maybe they were working there when? Anyway, get ready to lose more than 80 minutes of your life that you will never find. Yes, it's awful!
