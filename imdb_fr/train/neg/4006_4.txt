For those of you who have never heard of it (or who have seen it on A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an excessive psychologist, tobacco addict, called Fitz, who helps the Manchester Police Department to put themselves in the head of violent. the criminals. Considered one of the best shows ever seen in England (and that says a lot), it was a huge success in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars have reunited with the original author to eliminate an episode of 2 more hours. I have loved this series since I saw it for the first time, more than ten years ago. The DVD box has a place of honor in my collection and I can cite a good deal of Fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. Robbie Coltrane's idea of ​​joining Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I will start with the good sides. One of the many things that impressed me in Cracker's original series is the speed with which Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes after the first episode? with his lecture (throwing the books in the air), his drinking and his insinuation of the guy who follows him after him in the queue of slot machines? and you just knew who that character was. You could feel it "snapping" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, has remained excellent throughout the series. , but I always thought that some of the latest episodes ?? those not written by McGovern ?? abused the character. <br /> <br /> The good news is this: Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show ?? to make incredibly inappropriate comments at the wedding of her daughter ?? you will feel that "click" once more. It's him: petulant a moment and really sorry the next day, always insightful, sincere to the point of being tactless but brilliantly funny in passing. If you like this character as much as me, you will be delighted by the way it is described in the film. And that extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything related to Fitz is perfectly managed. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this film revolves around the crime Fitz is trying to solve. In standard Cracker mode, we know exactly who is the criminal in the first five minutes ?? the suspense is to see Fitz understand it. In this case, we have a serial killer who wants American blood. And the reason is, unfortunately, not due to a credible psychological trauma ?? it seems rather that the murders are simply intended to allow the writer to display his personal political convictions. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this because I'm convinced that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers. in the world. I do not have any problem with films dealing with current issues or those with a political position. But in Cracker's universe, we expect to see the characters behave like human beings, not like caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this film are all represented in a totally stereotypical way. They know nothing and complain about everything, treat locals as shit and cheat on their wives ?? one of them even managed to do all the above in less than 5 minutes. Honestly, I thought I had changed channels by mistake or something else. <br /> <br /> But that does not stop there. We are constantly reminded of how bad the war in Iraq is going ?? reminders that have absolutely nothing to do with history and that appear almost from nowhere. The killer is so busy saying that Bush is worse than Hitler, he almost forgot to continue the slaughter. but more specifically, he is such a spokesperson for the author's political views that he forgets to behave like a credible human being, and so we? as a public ?? do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man into a tortured serial killer soul. <br /> <br /> I can not say that it ruined the show for me ?? it was always a good TV, better than most of the rest of the genre (mainly because, again, of Coltrane). But his constant policy has made it impossible to be as good as the real Cracker classics like "To Be A Somebody" ?? an episode that was just as "problematic" but that was treated with much more subtlety and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: the absence of Panhandle is a disappointment, but the worst is its replacement. The whole police service ?? who has so long filled such great characters - is now full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable cops who lack any personality (how to drain a Richard Coyle Coupling exceeds me, but it is missing here indeed). <br /> <br /> There are also some moments when the series is lost. his credibility for me. One of those cases is Fitz, who has to reduce the Manchester population from one million to a hundred people on the basis of very strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?) ?? he succeeds not only in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended to watch, but do not forget to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Nevertheless, if there were new series to come, it was for good: I am convinced that McGovern can always write good things, and maybe now that his policy is out of his system, he can start again to write about people.
