This story of sword and witchcraft of a frighteningly brutal and insensitive "hero" defeating an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The acting is horrible from roles to secondary roles. The delirious and exhilarating joy with which the director shows the hero shedding blood on the blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed by any justice for his cause, since he is as bad as the people with whom he fights. Z-film editing is plentiful, including a scene where a character "dies" with a sword stroke that has clearly missed! <br /> <br /> The film clearly focuses on the charms of the woman, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who walks almost naked throughout the film. As a young man in his twenties, I do not pretend that the feminine flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so flippant and joyless that I could not even appreciate this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the nerdy films of this era are at least a little redeemed by a slight and ironic sensation (the rest is better in this respect), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself completely seriously as a heroic fantasy . No way! To avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 on ****.
