This film is pure guano. Mom always said that if you could not say anything nice ... but even mom would say that I had to do my part to warn others of this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee you this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes would go away. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent ... from a gun for giving him the script. After that, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to say, "There is still something about Mary." I have always been a fan of Wes Studi, I thank everyone for wearing a mask through the film so that people do not identify it. <br /> <br /> It begins in a promising way with a style A parody of the cinematography of Batman films and then just loses something ... like a coherent plot and half-decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed one hour before the line of striking comes, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see an effective parody of the world of comics, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! Do not walk far from "Mystery Men"!
