Somewhere, very deeply buried in this film, hides a decent mid-way film. The only traces are some first scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a cemetery) and eventually some pieces of the production design. As I say, buried deeply. One of the biggest challenges facing movies involving the supernatural is how to make the characters react credibly in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction when told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace's first film) is (was?) A werewolf is, if I remember correctly, in the sense of; "Oh really?". None of the best answers to this challenge. The non-receivers continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba, the "queen of werewolves" (apparently self-proclaimed). As a Stirba, Sybil Danning is the best thing in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, the Reb Brown acting game and the oddly simian werewolf costumes. End credits have become a minor legend and are available in all their splendor (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie has the same meaning. If you see this on American television, the credits have been reissued to replace Danning's ever-repeated cliché ripping his top up by another endless cliché repeating him to tear a cloak, but this time, she has some sort of high below. . It's a kind of nonsense, a cherry on top that defies satire.
