As a writer and director, what Hopkins manages to do gives us the impression that we do not know anyone in the film. However, that may be where the problem lies. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from deep within himself, but it's so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who this person is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be a screenwriter who mixes with his own characters. Is it possible? I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean there is no saying. The Hopkins movie is an experience. At first glance, it could be argued that this is a so-called screenwriter who, at the very moment of his encounter with fate, realizes that life is random and / or that success is a coincidence, whereas he is thrown into a "stream" of collisions between moments, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, he is so cerebrally implacable that he leaves no room for a hint of emotion, even the tiny and rudimentary measure of allowing us a connection with his characters. and a blazing school of trembling work and editing, with machine gun speed and a camera disengaged me, but as I pondered the film, I began to realize that it was for many. There are so many films from the last decade in which the cuts or the movement of the camera have sound effects, as well as other technical doodads deteriorating the atmosphere. I suppose that in this case, it was justified by the fact that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic reactivity of dreams. However, I knew almost nothing about Slipstream when I watched him, and I came out the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins made no effort to get us treated. There are interactive movies, and movies sitting in a rocking chair and knitted, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the latter.
