This movement was on television last night. I guess like a time filler, because it was afraid! The movie is just an excuse to show breasts and ass at the beginning and somewhere halfway. (Not bad breasts and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf", if that's how you can call it, is barely shown apart from saving his teeth. When it is completely visible, you can clearly see that some trainees have worked on the CGI, because the wolf runs as if he ran in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks to have been waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <The film is full of blood and blood, and you can easily see who is going to get killed / slaughter / being eaten. Even if you like this kind of splashed movies, you will be disappointed, they did not do a good job. <br /> <br /> Do not even get me started with the actors ... Very lame lines and girls scream at about every 5 seconds. But again, if someone asks me to do bad acting just to give me a few dollars, then where do I go? <br /> <br /> Overall, this horror is laughable and laughable.
