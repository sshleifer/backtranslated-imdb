This deliberately bizarre adaptation of Borges' novel is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, defeated by the dreadful half-cooked play of most actors. The film is firmly in the surrealist tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel and sometimes resembles that of a poor man on Elements of Crime by Lars Von Trier. Cox's apparent preference for single shots, jump cuts, and sound recording is contrary to the effectiveness of the film. Worth the detour but ultimately disappointing.
