This movie was terrible. Throughout the film, I was perplexed and I saw no interest. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was. This film is not worth seeing. Not only is it sick and disgusting but totally STUPID! Please do not look unless you are one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society, its values ​​and its roles, it is a country that I would not like to visit or bother to know. It's a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not like it because it made no sense. My boyfriend and I sat waiting to see if it was a horror because that's what was mentioned there. It was a total disappointment.
