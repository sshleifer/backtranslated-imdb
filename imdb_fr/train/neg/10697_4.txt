First of all, I thought it was naughty of them to tell the credits that the story and screenplay were from Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood's best writers until his talent faded and he retired. However, it was not the Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on the Robert Louis Stevenson short story, "The Bottle Imp". A good man takes possession of a devilish object that will grant him any desire but which will finally condemn him to hell. It is very good. Nobody said that the writers had to be original. The actors are usually quite competent given the mediocre writing they had to translate on screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero thinks he has found a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in order to save an innocent person. At first it seems to have worked, but according to the code of the modern horror movie, they feel obliged to provide a last spoonful of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The old horror movies got along very well and allowed the hero to win at the end. Triumph over evil is not wrong, no matter what the current generation of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the public a good, healthy fear while making them feel happy in the end. In fact, I think it's better.
