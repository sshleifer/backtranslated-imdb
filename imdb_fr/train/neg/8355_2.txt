Wanda Nevada is a fantasy fantasy film that, around 1979, uses ideas about what constitutes illicit romance for 13-year-old girls. The script, the steps and the instructions are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. The characters speak with the simplified diction that is usually found in movies for under 10 years, but also includes multiple sexual references involving the character of Shields as well as graphic dead. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy on a certain level but is never funny, an image of adventure but the plot and the action are tasteless, and a children's film but presents the pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. He also wants to be a buddy image, an image of the majority, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual film, a travelogue and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a total waste of time unless you want to see many fantastic shots of the Grand Canyon. This is very successful.
