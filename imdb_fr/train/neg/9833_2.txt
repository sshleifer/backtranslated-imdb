Falsely accused, John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie), skirt hunting friends, change their identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is supposed to be "Rev. Smith," but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith." At no time are any of them as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; although Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, from the point of view of his career. The pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), great of her time in "Our Gang", is a big interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have some cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's low-budget movies of the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
