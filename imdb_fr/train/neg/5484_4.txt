This film tells the story of a family trying to cope with the death of their mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genoa" looks promising, but it is unfortunately empty and without focus. The film consists only of a set of scenes describing the family's daily life, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and tedious, and fail to emotionally engage viewers. The end is very disappointing because it is neither spectacular nor moving. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by "Genova" The only asset of this film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as extended tourist advertising for the city, but no film.
