I can not believe I was watching this waiting anymore. It begins well. This film pushes far the limits of reality !! At least the first was a bit unrealistic. He tears up the first film and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers hates this movie. However, there is a good message, ATTENTION TO THE BIG BROTHER !!! The film gives the impression that Big Brother is much bigger than it really is. It was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors was completely bad. The acting game is very good. Some actors are really bad. The script was OK at times and completely messed up in other places. This movie is very convenient every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I watched him expect more. I think I'll go in the original to come back to earth ... Q
