This film has a lot of disadvantages and that's all I could see. it is painfully long and terribly directed. I could see the whole audience getting impatient and waiting for the end. the execution time is well over 3 hours and could have been modified within 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is average. most people have confessed to sitting on seats and expecting something better. <br /> <br /> it's fun only in the pockets. ambitious project and a lower than normal performance. govinda did a fair job, kapoor anil disappointed me, rest as planned. if you wait for something close to babel or love, then it is not near.
