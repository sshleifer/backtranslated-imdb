I went to see this film in the cinema and was shocked when I entered the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! It shouted to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable story with the fact that he falls in love with the girl who hates him. His game is ok but for the comic aspect of the film, it is not very good. The plot is poor and the comedy almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this criticism will prevent other people from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room!
