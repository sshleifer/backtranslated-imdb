R Balki is trying to tell you a story that was previously told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time, it is mixed with mature moods. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his work like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still can not do Hyderabadi Biryani properly. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu who sends him the good Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon start to meet and fall in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 years old and Tabu is 35 years old. No problem! But a hitch! Tabu's father, Paresh Rawal !! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger for him. And the complications begin ?? Performance wise all three actors are brilliant. The scenario of the film is very tight and interesting. The dialogues of the film are catchy. But somewhere, you feel that your stomach is not well filled. Comedy is sometimes not well understood. The film also tries to go very far in some places. <br /> <br /> Musically, there is nothing good to say about the song except the title track. The camera work is good. The director R Balki could have given much better of this scenario. But in the second half, he seems confused himself. The scene of the father "Satyagrah" seemed irritating. But the words spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during this scene deserve to be applauded. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar!
