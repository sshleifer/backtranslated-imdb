I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others tout - or, I write criticism to balance unjustified raves. I found this film almost unassailable and, unusual for me, I did not use a dialogue dull and cliché, but also to clear musical numbers and clichés. Whatever the originality of this film - an unusual domestic setting for a musical, a lot of imagination, a certain animation - it is more than offset by a scenario that does not develop an ounce of wit or an intriguing development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but can not make a team film. Neither is really charismatic or has a lot of sex appeal. They are both bland. I love Billy Gray, but his character is rather monotonous. The best part of the film for me is the beautiful costumes and the wonderful body of June Haver.
