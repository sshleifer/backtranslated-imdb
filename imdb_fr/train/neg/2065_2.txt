Rented last night. The opening (2001) lasted too long for WAAAAAAAAAY. The hitchhiking scene was useless. Some skits have been delayed. I previously knew that Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield's song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good content of a 75-minute film <br /> <Everything else was neither funny nor stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: if you want a rude movie imitating television and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less coarse film using television and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother to rent this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Film is ALWAYS "Modern Problems"
