This movie is really one of the worst waste of all time. It's really surprising that something so completely terrible can be done. But if you can stand the deafening plot, character development and orientation, you might get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so dreadful that it's funny. The film begins terribly and quickly becomes unassailable. Someone should give some kind of solace to the people involved in this film because their career was probably ruined because of their involvement in this film. If you end up seeing this movie or if you've already seen it (I feel your pain), those words came too late. For all the others, stay away at all costs or realize that the film is so bad that you will lose 2 hours of your life. So at least you can clean up or something by looking at it.
