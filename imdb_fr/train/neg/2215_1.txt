It's a sad film about this woman who thought that her ex-wife she loved so much was probably dead, but her father, a scientist, had just cast a spell on her to turn him into a really cute shark guy. A bit like in Beauty and the Beast. He could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe singing candlesticks, but there are rather rather coarse plants. They really itch this girl, so she lets herself be eaten by the shark guy instead of scratching the film. The scientist is a good father who tries to reunite his son shark fish with the woman to whom he was engaged. He even planned to spend time in private to have sex. This guy is a disgusting monster who does not want to have anything to do with him. She abandoned love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad that she only had to kiss her. It was back to normal and they would live happy, but it's not that kind of movie.
