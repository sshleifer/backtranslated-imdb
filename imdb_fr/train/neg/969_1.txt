I was rooted for this movie because it is a remake of the 1970s TV series for children "Escape into Night" which, although chaotic and sometimes staggered, was really strange, fascinating and disturbing. The role in "Paperhouse" is wooden, unintentionally a joke. The overdubs did not add tension, they only reinforced the fact that I was sitting watching a game. Casting exasperated the monotonous dialogue that resulted in relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or belief. As in most dull films, there are some good supporting films, these people should be comforted, reassured and reassured that they will not be held responsible. Of all the possible outcomes, the most unexpected was chosen ... More than I could dream. <br /> <br /> "Escape into Night" deserves a new remake, written by an experienced and subtly minded person.
