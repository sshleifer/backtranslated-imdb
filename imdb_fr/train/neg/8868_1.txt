Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The actors' game, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot. In fact, I can not say anything positive about it, even if I like Swedish movies. The fight scenes are so ridiculous that you can not take this seriously. And when the main character loses his shirt by avoiding bullets in a striptease, I do not know if it's supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks they are ingredients of a good movie ?! Regina Lund is the only actress in a semi-descent, but she disappears in a stream of laughable pronunciations and incredible reactions. It leaves you horrified that someone is spending time and money on something like that ...
