Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 rental of my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before my death, it will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever thought about this movie, or financed, deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they thought when they made this movie. This is an overweight man who is a hopeless romantic and who writes a pretentious phrase that attempts to pass for poetry. He joins his lover friend on a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and others. Only the fat boy has no girl. Skin films do not bother me, I take them as facial value. But this film tries to be more than a skin film. This is a fat guy looking for love in a girl, then meets another girl in silicone bikini who loves his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball that brings money back to his family and impresses the ladies, but he alone has his lady anyway. The dialogue is super-horrible even for a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie, with no porn content. Never watch this movie.
