What a disappointment ... certainly, the best of the precepts, but the story is weak, the plot is precipitous and the final result is a collection of poorly executed board pieces assembled in an amateur way. There are many errors of continuity that blatantly conflict with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader has been so terribly treated that what might have been a legendary moment in modern cinema has now become a ridiculous blunder that will ridiculed for many years. I will not complain about the abyssal dialogue, because it's about Star Wars ... The three original films had style, feelings of cult and troubling stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were superficial attempts to make more money, and this lack of love is blatant. Totally disappointing.
