I'm a big admirer of Lon Chaney, but the writing of this movie did not work for me. The story jumps strangely (I've since learned that there was a section missing from the movie), and the characters appear and disappear with an irritating suddenness. Some inter-titles are too explanatory (for example, "why, you're not a child anymore!" - cut the photo for a long and slow beat - "you're a woman!" Yes, we understood it first time ), but there are some talking sequences that require explanations that never appear (Listen to the argument of Luigi and his blonde girlfriend, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively speaking) if not technically), was so disturbing that it was difficult to watch. For the author, this issue has been treated as a problem and a match from May to December is not described as the inevitability of some of Mary Pickford's films (eg, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think it has been better directed in the past - he has done it several times here, IMHO. I liked the clown sequences and I was very impressed by the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, but surprisingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least favorite picture of Chaney.
