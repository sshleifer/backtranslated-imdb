...Already. This is the bottom. I'm not kidding. The theater should have received some warning. "Give up hope you enter here" would have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have the words to accurately describe the hell that film is. His debilitating stupidity does not even manage to amuse. This film is definitely intended for the slowest turtles of the sandbox. The story was stolen blatantly in a 10-minute cartoon of Bugs Bunny, and then stretched as Mr. Fantastic at 90 minutes excruciatingly painful. <br /> <br /> I remember the days when the Wayans were fun. I guess the pressure from Hollywood to produce products is to blame for shit that's happening at a steady pace. I am sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of jokes with a cartoon-based plot plot. <br /> I hated almost everything about the movie. I will not spoil anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wayans wrongly superimposed on the dwarf's body. What I did was the end. Not the resolution of the film, but the real end where we all got up to go out. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a star, but it clearly deserves less. I do not think the six minutes spent writing the script are worth a star. It deserves a Razzie and I pray that God will get it. <br /> <br /> When will people learn? if you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop making it poo. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You were warned.
