Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is actually made for the flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such films that are worth nothing as category C films. Or even some category C movies have a better and more pleasant story than Tashan. Tashan, very excited and too confident in his promotion, badly bombed at the box office he certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film ever made under the banner of the Honorable Yash Raj Films. How is it that they have managed such a heavy project with the new Vijay Krishna Acharya who does not have the real sense of doing action? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's way of doing things like Dhoom, but he finally suffered. Action scenes are more like comic books or cartoon movies designed to drain the audience. <br /> <br /> History also loses its meaning and substance to tenderly win the hearts of the public. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the South Tamil Rajnikant star in his body language and verbal expressions. I'm not a fan of Saif or Akshay, but the attribution of Kareena should have finally been attributed to Saif 'instead of Akshay. Right off the bat, I was waiting for that, but in the end, I did not like the truth of the climax. Saif is the main person responsible for the whole adventure, while Akshay joins him. In any film, the final must be judged with the entire characters of the entire story and the prize or award must be awarded to the one who deserves the credit. And Tashan loses this way and fails unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Akshay is not new to show his talent as an actor here, but still reminisces his previous films. He badly needs to form a new image for his fans that would impress them again and again. In the meantime, Saif did a great job in Race and through this film he returned to his hilarious nature. But it has fully developed in the field of acting. And last but not least about Kareena. She looks really hot with a bikini dress, some of which complain because she has become too skinny. But I myself do not think so, she has become thin. Yes thin !!! it is a good factor for a woman to attract the most important people (or, say, men). Beside them, it is good that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appears at the beginning and end as a young Saif. I hope that now he too will look to becoming an actor. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan are either immature or mentally or still want to return to childhood or want to be admitted. in an asylum. Vijay Krishna Acharya, the beginning director, who mismanaged the project proposed by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he should experiment and study the script for at least 5 years before embarking on practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to give good stars to this kind of unwanted movies.
