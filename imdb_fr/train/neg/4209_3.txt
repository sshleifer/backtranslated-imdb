"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What does that mean?! This plot could not be worse because a boy who is afraid of everything becomes brave at the very end of the film because he has entered a library. The sole purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, while a cheaper and more efficient way of doing so could have been a series of advertisements! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as "so predictable" librarian as he is the Master Page), could save this useless movie from the dull plot. Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood god Frank Welker as cartoon characters never save it, I can only describe it as an equivalent of the 1990s to the same appalling adaptation of Water Babies of 1978, because the bland animation aggravates the film without improving the dull plot!
