I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and I really loved it! It is a classic historical novel set in the 1600s, while the west of the country was several days away from London and that law and order were much more difficult to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. Actor and production values ​​are acceptable, but the way the story was told was horrible. Why do television adaptations do that? Why would they think that thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story ??? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC has made an excellent version that was televised at Christmas in the early 90s and I'm still trying to find a copy! Follow my advice, read the book and do not bother with this derisory version!
