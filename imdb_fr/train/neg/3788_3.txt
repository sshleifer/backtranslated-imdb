There is a lot to love here. The actors are first rate and the scenario provides a good dialogue, capturing the atmosphere of a close and friendly family. However, for this reason, the film does not sound right. We see that Leo, who has apparently been diagnosed with HIV, reacts essentially in a way that does not correspond to the supportive atmosphere in which he finds himself. In addition, the film ends rather abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family had to deal with their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive, like the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide whether they wanted an enlightening essay on the effects of HIV on an attractive and functional family, or on the devastation of HIV on the victim - so this is an allusion to both. Although this film provides food for thought, it leaves the viewer wanting more than what he delivers.
