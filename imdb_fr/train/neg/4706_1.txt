That's right, you've heard me say that this film is a creepy ABOMINATION. First, the band, who the hell is going to see or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, but the musicians are too, they can not even play anything! In addition, the singer has a more feminine sound than Geddy Lee and his voice is even more horrible! Not only are they terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Directed by a shitty director and a complicated scenario, this film must be the most stupid of all time. I would like this website to allow you to use a vote equal to zero or less than 10, because giving a 1/10 to this dirt is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call that. a comedy movie. If you are looking for a musical, go to "Weird Al" Yankovic because he does it a lot better than those tweens without talent.
