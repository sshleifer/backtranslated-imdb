There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even brighter. The fact that I even found it for rent was absolutely incredible. Anyone connected to this movie must be high on something! So what was the story? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to understand the story in the first four minutes of the movie? Unfortunately, I have tried several times to watch this. I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I think a little bit of merit could go to the director, because some of the shots made the film more than a B movie. That could push him. I loved the theme song. It is good that it is only a dollar, it was worth it. I guess you'll enjoy the movie if you're high as the actors and the team do. Is the pot legal in France?
