Well, it's Robin Hood as a "geezer" well ... just as advertised! It did not seem very encouraging and, alas, it was worse than I thought. <br /> <br /> A kid that I can take; a Robin who gets confused with the daughter of a dyer, I can say it; but it's harder to swallow a Robin who's trading jokes with his henchman, and a Robin and the whole cast who seem to have trouble managing their lines is the kiss of misfortune. How could anyone let such painful childbirth go without re-turning the scenes? Again and again, it looks like he has a hard time understanding Shakespeare, half understood, rather than letting go with a salty chunk; I was hoping initially that it was only a comedy trait missed in a character clearly intended for the role of comic sidekick, but that it began to spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Everything you said about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the gift of delivering a high-flying dialogue as naturally as if he had thought about it at the moment ... and as this production shows, it is not at all as simple sounds! If they wanted to portray the characters as brazen chappies, the actors in question should have been given the appropriate lines: they would sound as if they had no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid. I did not even like the sheriff pantomime, for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but delivered (and in this case written) with a boost and a nod to the audience. They're out of place - stuff that destroys the fourth wall - but not really funny. <br /> <br /> This much-promised production makes me think of a lame play. The only actor and character that I feel of appreciation is the one who plays Guy de Gisbourne, who is the only one to have seemed to master (a) credible malice and (b) credible characterization - but frankly, I would not do it . I did not say it was a good omen for the future of the series! At the time of writing this article, I will give another stroke of luck in the hope that things will improve and fall asleep by next week, with a less stable staging and perhaps that the actors will be more comfortable with the dialogue:, the opening episode of "Doctor Who" was not really a show, but it was far from being as bad as that. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I fear that the series has lost a spectator. <br /> <br /> Which would be a shame, because I have a weakness for the "Robin Hood" "The legend on the screen, Douglas Fairbanks adventures to the solid dependence of Richard Greene.But this Robin does not can not stir my blood in the least.
