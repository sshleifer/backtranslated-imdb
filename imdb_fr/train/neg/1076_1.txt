It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he could not deliver his lines. The plot was certainly not worthy of the name of John Grisham. No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I did not even look at it. I decided that I did not care who did it, and then realized there was no "whodunit" to consider!
