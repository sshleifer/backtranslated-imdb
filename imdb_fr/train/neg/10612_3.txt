What a wonder for a movie: imagine a movie with an author who decides to take tango classes. Hey, and an even better idea is the central role played by a filmmaker interested in tango. Gosh I would like to have this talent for genius. Yes, I am sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It surprises me that this type of zero potential for making money is realized. Come on, unless you're a rabid tango fan (I concede they exist, judging by the comments) or a fierce member of Sally Potter's fan club (?) There's nothing in this film that makes you to rush the cinema to see him. Even if you like tango, much of the film is devoted to insignificant scenes such as a house under renovation or a man in a wheelchair taking a road <br /> <br /> Coming soon THE LESSON REVIEW where a screenwriter Scottish failed sat in front of a computer and wrote very sarcastic but very entertaining reviews of the movies he saw. Shudder when Theo Robertson embarks on the latest Hollywood blockbusters, mourns sympathy as he receives a new letter of rejection from a film production company, falls in lust as he takes a bath and rubs in the air. soap on his toned body. THE LESSON OF REVIEW is coming soon to a movie theater near you if someone is stupid enough to finance the film <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter
