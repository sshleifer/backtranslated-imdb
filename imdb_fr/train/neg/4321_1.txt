It was the worst Christmas film I have ever seen. I took my two little children to see that. It was the darkest and saddest plot - the family has no money, mom loses her job, her father gets killed in the bank, a bank robber steals the family's car with both children in the back and, after a high-speed chase, leave the bridge and drown them in the river. Mom stays alone. No wonder his Christmas spirit is gone. Christmas angels do not save children who have drowned and Santa Claus does not bring back dead fathers! I thought it was the worst message to send to children. It's better to tell them that there is NO Santa than to show them a movie like this !!
