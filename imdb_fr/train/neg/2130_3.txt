I guess I'm coming late to the party. I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I did not know it existed and I was quite ready to see the 1963 movie version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I'm thinking of putting on an amateur production show because I remember it as being so much fun to do. I was not impressed by this new version. It was not enough fun. It was not colorful. He lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. Nobody seemed to mention that fact. It's not a bad mood musical, it's brilliant and thrilling. The decision on lighting was a little creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a joke, a comedy of errors. I have no idea of ​​this in this version. The lighting was awful and the overall performance was tarnished. The dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos these days. At least the number of dances should have matched some of the best of them, or the best of Broadway. The choreographer was sleeping at the wheel, it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors are extremely talented, there were very bad casting choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented artists in Latin, would not it have been more accurate to give one of them the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African-American, charming and talented, but a bad cast. Jason Alexander's efforts were amazing, he's still doing a smart job, but he just was not Albert. It was badly received and I think this is obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The medium of the film is not the medium of the scene. There must be a translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the flash of musical scene must be translated into film. There is no merit to being faithful to a scenario when it is filmed. The spirit, the essence of the production must be put forward. For me, Bye Bye Birdy's film production in 1963 was brilliant and lively, while the 1995 film was as dark as the lighting and as drab as the dance numbers. It turned out to be a waste of effort on the part of many very talented people.
