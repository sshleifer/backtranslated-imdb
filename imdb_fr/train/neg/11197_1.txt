What was the worst film of 2003? "The cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" But no! I propose that it is this little atrocious film of beginning of the year. Badly written, poorly edited, and (if I may be so bold) misinterpreted, "The Order" is the film's black hole - a film so dense that even the slightest entertainment could not escape its horrible event. It's not even accidentally funny, like (for example) "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know that producers think that their audience will not be very intelligent. They renamed the movie, originally titled "The Sin Eaters," because they thought the Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, even though they went to great lengths to explain what is a sin eater. Instead, they find a completely generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen is ample enough for you to enter it. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw Heath's picture and trained me. Congratulations, producers, you have reached your target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific order (you guessed it) who is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has problems with celibacy, perhaps because no sensible person could believe he knew anything about religion, let alone a single monk. The only other member of this order is a funny fat alcoholic guy. Even though I wanted to see the funny alcoholic returning to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who imitated Monty Python, thinking that if they just said lines like Pythons would they automatically fun? You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say more, I risk generating spoilers. Frankly, what spoiled this film is the fact that it was created.
