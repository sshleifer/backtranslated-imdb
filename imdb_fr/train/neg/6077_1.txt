Would anyone really look at this RUBBISH if it did not contain small naked kids? From a cinematographic point of view, it's probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. A pervert woke up one day and thought that I would make a movie with little girls in it and that I would call it art, that I would stick them in the countryside and that it was not necessary to tell a story or to explain how they had arrived there or why they did not appear to live anywhere or to have parents, because p * rn movies do not need anything like that. I would like to comment on the rest of the movie but I have not checked the spoilers so I will just say avoid, avoid avoid and you find a good movie to watch
