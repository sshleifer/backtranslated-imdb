I had never seen a Tarzan movie, so when I saw it on TV, I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately, I must say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and slightly overweight. Not as I imagined that Tarzan would look. And, unless I miss a cup of tea, Tarzan has never given his traditional roaring cry. He was also missing Tarzan swaying in the trees - leaping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Oh, too bad for the expectations. In any case, Jane was there - the Cheeta monkey was there. There was a guy with a guitar over there. There were bad guys and good guys and a love story ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing wrong, you understand, but nothing good either. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to present Tarzan: 4/10
