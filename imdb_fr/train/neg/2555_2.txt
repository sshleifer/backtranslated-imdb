This movie is probably one of the most horrible horror films I've seen. The length was not long enough to include a good script. In addition, the way the adoptive parents died was simply ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies of a shower after stumbling on a figurine and the father is shot by a policeman? I can see where some originality might have been what they were looking for, but it could have been better. In addition, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press on stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and discovering it was "Lucifer", I wanted to gag. Yes, it's interesting to note that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a man's name. It should be given to a male character. Overall, the movie was boring and could have used a better plot.
