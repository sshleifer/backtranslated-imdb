This is the kind of movie you regret having inserted in your VCR. This is a weird and heartbreaking version of Stephen Kings' movie, "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this movie got a score of 5.2, because it has no story, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This film should have been broadcast as a short film. instead .. too much time is spent on the same thing. And as in any bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the film in a time of 10 to 15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Before deciding to watch this movie, make sure you put new batteries in your remote control, because you will do a lot of fast forward ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
