No words can describe my absolute hatred for this awful interpretation of the BTK killer. In evaluating this film, one in ten completes this really disastrous excuse for a film. From beginning to end, there was not a single highlight. Everything was horribly assembled; script, actor, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, to name a few. A number of scenes are literally funny, because of the awful way everything is assembled. This criticism may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget movie, but it is not. Just thinking about the movie I just saw, my blood starts to boil. I will NEVER know how this film got production rights. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly remarkable in regards to its pathetic and horrifying horror. Honestly, I can say that during all my years in the movies, it's the worst. MOVIE. ALREADY. I lost more than an hour of my life on this useless trash and I would have jumped from the nearest building before if I knew what I was looking for. ZERO out of ten.
