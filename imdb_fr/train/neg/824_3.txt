Gene Hackman is taken out of prison by an anonymous government agency that wants him murdered. It goes without saying that Hackman has the requisite skills for the job. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells him anything, but he knows it, because the public receives bits of information. This is supposed to be suspensive, but boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman continues his mission, but the escape is spoiled and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders all the dead to conceal it. So everyone dies and in the end you do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours a bit. The translation may have lost something, but I tend to think it was an act of clemency to the public. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast of people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney and Eli Wallach. and Edward Albert is so completely wasted here that it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never find out which federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
