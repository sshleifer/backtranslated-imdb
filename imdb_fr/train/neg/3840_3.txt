I had heard about this film some time ago from a friend and she recently bought it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we both heard it was a scary movie, really scary. What was my disappointment ?? VERY!!!! Outside this scene (we all know what bit) NOTHING happened !!! I was expecting to see the woman in black several times and make her some more agitated scenes, like appearing at the window or crossing the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all critics here say what a scary, gripping atmospheric film. I just did not see it, I'm scared. Perhaps there is a difference between what people find scary in the United States and here in Britain. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the resounding critics :(
