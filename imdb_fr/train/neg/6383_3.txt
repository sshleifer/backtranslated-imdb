Gayniggers from Outer Space is a foreign short film about black and gay extraterrestrials exploring the galaxy until they fall on Earth. Being gay, their goal is to create an exclusively male universe in which all people are homosexual. Therefore, when they discover that women or "female creatures" live on Earth, they are terrified at first; finally, they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and to liberate the male population. <br /> <br /> An offending title with a racist, homophobic and sexist scenario, even if it is probably meant to be a satire, gives this film a shocking value. However, there is little substance underneath. As another reviewer has pointed out, there are few jokes apart from the characters' names (eg, ArmInAss); I think I laughed once about a little gay joke. I think I quickly understood the purpose of the film, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that, I had enough; I still wanted the film to end already (and it's a short film!). Not brilliant or particularly well written.
