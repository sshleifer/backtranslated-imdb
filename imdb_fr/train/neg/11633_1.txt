If I could, I would give zero star to this one, but unfortunately, I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is no scene that can make me laugh ... but the game does not did not make me think of me. laugh either. So, if you're badly delayed, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some have done here. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a film where children are shot to reach humor ... good taste goes beyond ... this is the third time I lose my Time to see a movie Boll and it was definitely the last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I am ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE, PLEASE KEEP IT TO MAKE EVEN MORE MOVIES !!!!!
