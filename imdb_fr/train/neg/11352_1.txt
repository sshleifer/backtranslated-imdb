Here is what you would get if you allowed a 10-year-old (manic) American child to write the story of a trip to the moon. Absolute waste without redemptive qualities Perhaps it has aroused a certain fascination in the 3D department. but as narrative and entertaining animation, it has nothing to envy to a loss of an hour and a half. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Not enough lines, yet I think that sums up ... well, I agree with a review above - c is like a Cold War propaganda story. It might have been more interesting if they had managed to make the flies discover the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died at the first minute. BTW - why were all the flies of the main character deformed? - None had the full compliment of the members!
