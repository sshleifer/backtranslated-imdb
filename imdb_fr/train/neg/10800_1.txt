What was the purpose of this film? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to lead and I am Kazaam! A genius that raps? Come on. Eminem or Linkin Park may be in a movie like this. I remember that I watched that just to kill time. It did not really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" The whole story seemed so stupid. It made no sense. I imagine that an unrealized morality of this film is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not say much more because this film is so terrible that there is nothing worth commenting on. I "wish" that this film disappears.
