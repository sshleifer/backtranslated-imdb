Maybe I'm obsolete or do not know what Electra looks like in current publications ... But Electra I read was much more manipulative and always seemed to have a plan. She usually used other people to do her dirty work and most often a kind of double cross was involved. Just when you thought you understood everything, she covered your eyes and made her way. <br /> <br /> This film was rather weak in dialogue, the acting was not particularly convincing, and the action was uneven. I was really looking for something more in the style of Frank Miller's book, "Electra Assassin". Which is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where cool, the action was sometimes interesting, but most often, the story and plot were slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not enough ... bitch. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I did not care anyway.
