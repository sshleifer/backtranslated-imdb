I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it did not work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's production and found it very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, clever sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these qualities are sorely lacking in Alive. The plot is cool if not quite original and could have done for a nice movie of ace. Unfortunately, the pace is painfully slow and the film takes a while to get going before reaching quite predictable places. The action is pretty passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the previous one on OK. The first is also tainted by a camera too fast, which reduces the coherence. There are neat visual effects and interesting ideas flowing through the dialogue, but the film is still lagging badly. The characters are neither well fleshed nor well played and the frame and the overall colors are dull and boring. The film is not completely horrible and has some points of interest, a judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. With about twenty minutes behind the clock, it could be a pretty decent sci-fi thriller. But the complete movie is dull. Only recommended to very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
