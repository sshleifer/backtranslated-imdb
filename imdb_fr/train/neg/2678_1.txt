Nothing positive to say. Sinuous stupidities, blowing and blowing with a "message". The new Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (we think about the cuckoo), but many have the bouquet of cardboard and asbestos aftertaste (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). It's a type of void "dozor". To act would be horrible without the saving grace of a totally unattractive staging and an incompetent montage that is sometimes so terrible that it distracts attention from the impotence of the actors. Special prize to the cameraman for making sure every shot is unstable (would anyone realize that Blair Witch had his 15 seconds of undeserved celebrity?) And takes shots for attention-defective pre-teens who faint against CounterStrike and masturbation. The main female role poses and tries to sound seductive too often, the male anti-hero needs a diction coach (although genetics is not bad: rather expressive eyes). A (middle) finger for this irrelevant non-art stack. Anyone who comments positively is better to be a cousin (distant) of the "authors".
