My God. This film was awful. I can not complain too much. I went to see him just to be fat. That was enough in a way. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the film is at the very beginning, where the woman is extremely forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic Soldier, who was a supportive actor in Next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible actor job. It was one of the worst actors I have ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be much more macabre than the first. It was not. I was expecting it to be more macabre because it's a sequel and horror movies are generally much less successful than their predecessors. I was expecting it to be more appalling because gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was actually Not as horrible as the first, was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants of the first were rather disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying so hard to make them frightening to the point that they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing the female soldier clip on her camera phone saying "I love you, Mom" ​​FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it at first because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel EYE for her. showing three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
