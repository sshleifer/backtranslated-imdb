Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty Drawing: Requires a little work, but could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on July 4th? Let's go there! Leave me alone!!! It was a movie that should not have been done. It was bad. It did not really happen in the holidays in particular, except July 4th. This has made it particularly difficult since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any film can be ruined by too many songs. Frequent songs made this movie look much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix two familiar Chirstmastime characters with a traditional American feast (which almost seems to "limit" it to America), too many useless songs, and an ugly plot. The result? A bad movie that can not really be watched at any time of the year. I suggest you give up this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
