All the naked women in the world could not help but press the stop button at about a third of this horrible garbage. With a derisory action game, an equally terrible scenario plus the poor CGI FX to match; This film is an insult to the Werewolf type. It's supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this movie could even make a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but too lazy to do anything, even a decent quarter. Avoid at all costs and look instead at one of the werewolf classics. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
