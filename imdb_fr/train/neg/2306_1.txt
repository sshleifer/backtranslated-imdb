I wonder what the people who gave this 10 saw that I had not seen it. This movie has VERY hard to follow and / or stay on a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, make no mistake, it's about 98% drama and 2% comedy. All the actors perform a good performance, we can not deny it, but it seems that he really lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and needed to be changed or what. It had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like to have the hour and a half I invested in this movie, but the video rental location does not come back on time. Save your money and see something else.
