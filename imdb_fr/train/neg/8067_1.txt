First, let me tell you that this must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this film is even thrilling. Most things are very confusing and as you progress, you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through everything I say ... "More power for you" !! By cons, I just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker, the entertainment is not. This film is stupid and a waste of time. It seems that most people here also agree. Most of that did not make sense, and by the time you think you have a scene, you realize that another lame scene is coming in and ... well, you see where it's going. Avoid, this one is bad ... bad !!
