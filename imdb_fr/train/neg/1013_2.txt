If you watched this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Whenever they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laugh, thinking, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Funny to act! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me, I did not have much fun with him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying. I was happy when they were both in the street. <br /> <br /> The story was good and I think Dylan Mc Dermott played his nasty role very well. The movie was fun but I think Timberlake ruined everything. It would have been very nice without him. By the way, the music was OK, but every time the music came out, the movie turned into an MTV video clip with flashes, weak moves, and things like that. Something badly placed for this police film, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
