The film My Name is Modesty is based on an episode that takes about one page from Blaise's novel The Night of the Morningstar. He describes an incident in which young Modesty (17 in the book, in her mid-20s in the film) asserts her leadership in a war against a casino. As happens before Blaise's adventures, his trusted sidekick, Willi Garvin, does not feature in the movie. This is one of the main problems, because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has certainly always been one of the fascinating aspects of novels and comics. The other problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring because it's just a little episode turned into a screenplay. The casting is correct but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as a heroine and is too old to play the role of the young Modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and easy solution to not lose the rights of the Blaise franchise.
