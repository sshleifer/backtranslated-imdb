This film had good intentions and a good story to tell. The director and scriptwriter of this film failed miserably and created a dull, boring film that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's Grade 8 social science class - in 67 years. <br /> <br /> Will anyone want to take this story and make it a real movie? History deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time a scene had potential, we only had a few shots, combined with black and white footage that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only source of light in this monotonous party. The other actor was incredibly boring - it fit the film perfectly and anyone who was playing the captain set a new low standard for online distribution. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the many flaws in this movie and are not concerned with being impressed or entertained, but want to learn more about the USS Mason, it's worth watching .
