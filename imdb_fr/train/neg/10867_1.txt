It's a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do a lot better than that (play, write and direct) 2) It's so serious that I have to leave a criticism and warn others. .. <br /> <br /> Looks like it was shot with my video reversed. I also believe that my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. I noticed that there are positive messages for this personal video; Must have been left by team members or people having something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I have ever seen. Let's hope the writers and the director leave the company. not even talented enough to advertise !!!!!
