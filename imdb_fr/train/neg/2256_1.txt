I must admit that I may have seen five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm above looking at what's on his show. You should try to rise above that too. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as part of a social studies event that I was running. I was told that this movie had really little to do with Springer himself, he was focusing instead on the lives of those who would appear on "Springer". Better managed, this film would have been a fascinating look at the pathetic life of these people. I will admit that I felt a touch of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all she has in life. How sad she feels to have to participate in Jerry's show to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> I'm so sorry for Molly Hagan who appears here. Did you notice that after this film, she was mostly relegated to the rank of "B" on television? I will say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I do not doubt that she is very serious in her game and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not lead a scene alone. She simply does not have what it takes to play a leading role. Her best work will always be Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but her heart was in the right place) and when she played in "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
