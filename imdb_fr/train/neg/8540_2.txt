As someone else has mentioned, it starts with a weird prologue about a blonde girl who kills a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and go for a walk in the mountains. They first spend the night in an inn where the slightly deaf owner is harassed, with increasing irritation to the public, by Gaffari. Once in the mountains, they seek shelter again and are invited by a kind old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, whoever?). What will happen next, I will leave to the audacious spectator to settle because I certainly could not. t. Now, I like Eurohorror, and it would be better if Artigot (screenwriter AND director) had tried to tell a story logically. The backdrop (Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and occult occurrences. The green summits could easily overshadow the supernatural forces and those who command them. The photography is beautiful. Wish everything makes sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
