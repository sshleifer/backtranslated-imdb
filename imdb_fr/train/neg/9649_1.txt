Who were they laughing at? There were too many things in this movie that were difficult to digest. From the moment Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unconsciously wishes for the death of his father, he arrives in London with his uncle (interpreted by Om Puri) to abandon him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has already gone through London Heathrow knows that such a holiday would be impossible to organize and especially not by an Indian. But the problems of cinema do not stop there, there is the question of the two principal stars (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who pass for stars of rock on the verge of realizing their dreams. I mean yes, we have seen success come to Susan Boyle (a British woman who dreams after 50 years), but it was a rare case. It was really difficult for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the cast of Salman and Ajay was poorly designed. They would never want Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, so why should we have to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men in their forties) trying desperately to hold on to their 20s? Do not even talk about the most self-aware actress on screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I have seen) and she is just desperate as an actress, so aware of her appearance that she only cares about watching and sailing for the camera rather than giving good performance. It's hard to believe that she refused all these other roles in the movies to play in this down and then be as soft as an actress and that there is nothing to write at home. And to top it off, the movie was dragged along with boredom. This is nothing special, believe me, you will predict everything that will happen in clich√©s.
