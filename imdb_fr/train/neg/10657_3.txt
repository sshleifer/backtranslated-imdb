I had a lot of hope for this film so I watched it with a lot of expectations. mainly because of Kamal Hassan. He is an incredible actor who has made his mark in the sand of time forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this film, the brutality and violence of darkness and mechanical orange are much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring policeman. Who is assigned to investigate brutal serial killings. Raghavan effectively finds the common thread in this case and is close to solving the murders and putting the psycho-psychological killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they escape and launch themselves again in a slaughter . Finally, Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killers are those who will prevent the public from going to the theater. Murders, sexual harassment and rape are shown very explicitly, without which the film could have survived. <br /> <br /> Even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this film in the cinema and that an image that he will necessarily paint in their minds are certainly not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has obligations to society and his audience. Certainly, I never go to movies that look like Gautham's name on the production list.
