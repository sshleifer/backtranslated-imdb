Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a ruined apartment in New York and relies on his mother to pay the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who can be married or not but that Aldolpho would like to play in his film. When, unexpectedly, Al receives a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did. That is until Joe takes Al on an adventure to steal a Porsche for some of the financial support. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely devoid of spine? And will Angelica be the star of the movie? It is, in the opinion of this spectator, a horrible film. The script is abominable, with a plot that wanders willy-nilly. Beals scolds practically all his lines and Buscemi, although friendly, is indescribable. There are a lot of bad materials and bad characters to start. Finally, the production values ​​are also very poor, which gives the film a second-rate appearance at any time. If you have time in front of you, it's always a good idea not to take a chance with this movie. But, if you are the proverbial glutton of punishment, go ahead and watch the damn thing. Beals is beautiful, after all.
