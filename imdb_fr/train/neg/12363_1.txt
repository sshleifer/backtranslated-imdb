This is one of those movies that was visibly trying to overcome the craze for martial arts. A bit like Billy Jack I guess. However, while Billy Jack had a remarkable martial arts scene, there is none unless you look a bit like a serious man who struggles and dresses hard. We are introduced to the star that is described as having learned judo in the marines. I was in the Marines and although they are fairly established in boxing, I do not really remember the emphasis on judo. As a result, the antagonist James Macarthur refers to Judo when he offers an excuse to explain why he, a state-champion wrestler, was easily defeated. Lame.
