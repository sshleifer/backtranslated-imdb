I hear rumors about an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Blu-ray disc". With the progress made over the last 25 years, ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I only hope that it will help eliminate the bad taste left in my mouth by this fiasco of demonstrations of Magnavision. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates that the Betamax VCR" was a milestone in the history of entertainment. After the attempt "Leonard Nimoy shows the compact tape" and the very ugly "Leonard Nimoy shows the tape 8 tracks", who would have expected such a glorious film? I'm crying, just thinking about it.
