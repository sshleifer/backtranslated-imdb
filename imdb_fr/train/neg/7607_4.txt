- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean the city. However, not everyone in town is happy with what she does. When the sheriff orders curfew in town, the local salon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to handle the sheriff. The salon owner has no chance of knowing that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when a pretty interesting concept is associated with poor performance. There is a good movie somewhere here that is trying to come out. In more competent hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger could have cast an entertaining glance on the role of women in the Old West. As it stands, Gunslinger is the clutter of a movie. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things that do not fit in the film: a support cast without any gaming ability, an oversized and artificial dialogue, and like sets. But the biggest offender is writing. I was surprised to see how many times a scene would begin with actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to shout "Action". The best is the scene of two horsemen riding right next to a building. Suddenly, they take off and race around the corner, as if they ran for several kilometers. Or, take the example of people who can apparently move from one end of the city to the other. We see a man enter a building and a second later, get out of the city to ride his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not like Corman did not have some good actors to work with. Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all capable of a good performance. But in Gunslinger, we do not give them much knowledge. <br /> <br /> - I just saw the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I highly recommend taking the MST3K route.
