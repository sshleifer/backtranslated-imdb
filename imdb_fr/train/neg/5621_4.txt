I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was therefore expecting to love this movie. After watching it, however, I honestly think I could have made a better documentary myself. His arguments seem to have only four parasitic sources (although he is listed on the credits on IMDb, I did not see Richard Dawkins anywhere), he rode together with ridiculously amateur computer effects, and he does not no attempt to appear impartial. The narrative is omnipresent with a sneering, almost adolescent, anti-Christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film could actually change someone's mind instead of just preaching to the choir (ie me). Although there is an interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film poses an unbearable problem when he begins to dwell on the Christian school in which the director made himself a child, an institution that apparently has profoundly affected him psychologically by obsessing him. day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT obviously has a small budget, it was still possible to make an intelligent comment here on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. There is certainly a shortage of religious documentaries with market skepticism, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this trash, which ultimately seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is unfortunate that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he does not need to subject his audience to his coping mechanism.
