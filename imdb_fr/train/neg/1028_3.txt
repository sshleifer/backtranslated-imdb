I do not remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as Justin Timberlake's "Edison". I was so moved that I wanted to scream with anguish, destroy the screen, easily accept the desperate cries of nihilism. Timberlake is horribly misplaced; In fact, to make it play, it's as if Andy Dick had the lead role in "Patton" or Nathan Lane in the role of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be just as terrible regardless of his role. I had problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake gives Affleck the appearance of Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), juvenile looks and emotional expressions that derive from something like "The 25 cliché expressions for the actors", he poisons the screen on which he is mercilessly inflicted. and will not accept his role as an amateur journalist turned journalist for justice and justice. It will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake is not the only one responsible for his failure. Director David J. Burke places him not only in the lead role (essentially), but also sets him aside. Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he's so good) LL Cool J. I can imagine that someone is suffering almost physically by watching some of his actors interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> There is of course an advantage to this: the moment when one of these actors interacts without Justin, one has the impression of a double relief. . A pleasure, if you want. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time, but these ten minutes are a bliss in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But enough retaliation against Timberlake - words are not enough in this particular case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very ordinary corruption story. His plot goes from the cliché to simply ridiculous. However, I admire the motivation that led to its realization, which I interpret as a tribute to films like "Serpico", "Donnie Brasco" or maybe even "Chinatown". Do not get me wrong, "Edison" is not even in the same stage as these movies, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its purpose, perhaps to justify my presence through it. <br /> <br /> The script, in itself, has a surprisingly bad writing. Yes, there are some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is wasted here) and Timberlake seems to have been removed from an episode of Dawson's Creek. It's your typical dialogue - far too superficial - for-the-reality, impress-the-public-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail). This dialogue, you notice, is punctuated by good music at the wrong times - sometimes, we get the impression that "Edison" wants to turn into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated by the game actor, but precisely by the badly chosen music. and different movie speeds (slow motion playback). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. Of course I had a casting for which to kill, but the performances are ruined by Timberlake that just does not work. In cinema as in most arts, if something goes wrong, everything feels. Administrators must make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the target here. Some scenes play well in themselves, but overall they do not seem to be puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into the same incoherent picture. And it's not a particularly exciting puzzle.
