Does Elizabeth Taylor, rich and sick, woo the angel of death in her fortress island in the Mediterranean, or does she overreact - or more precisely, excessively - as usual? In fact, both are applicable in the wandering and sinuous mess of the director Joseph Losey called "Boom", titled appropriately since the temperaments in the lush and luxurious setting are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai dress with saber. Although beautiful in widescreen, the photo is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz'n Dick-philes should flee (the collective attitude of the stars "that heck!" With regard to their film career the late 60's reached a madman nadir here). Useless, confused, and infuriating, "Boom" is a disaster - although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play "The Milk Train Does not Stop Here Formerly," liked it! * from ****
