Famous Japanese director Takashi Miike can not seem to get things done with this tormented thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about a devilish old woman (and child abuser!) Who is part of a new Urban legend: sounds strangely - and you see the message "A missed call" - you will only be able to replay the message to hear your last words before your death. The most successful part of the film is the incisive satire of Reality TV cameras invading future victims, but the undeveloped deaths (which include a piece of hidden red candy!) Are disappointing and disheartening. The frequent shots of ravaged corpses are actually displayed quite discreetly, and this general politeness may be why the film is ultimately so vivid. As expected, Hollywood jumped on the wacky plot in 2008, but the US version did not do better. NO STARS of ****
