I am a big fan of cinema. I like movies of all types. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that he is following the book closely, which suggests that everything should not be turned into a film. Especially since the authenticity of the book's experiences has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not weird, they are mentally ill. The things that are happening are not funny, they disturb; Especially considering that they are supposed to be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of the Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated, only Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny. <br /> <br /> I will never recover those hours. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
