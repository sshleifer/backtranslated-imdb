It's simply the worst film I've ever seen. It's 2 hours or more, and the art of the box was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be 300 years for a poor man. You know, laugh and make fun. No, there is nothing funny in this film, only pain. Then the movie starts and they speak a different language. We think 'Oh, this is just the beginning.' But no, from there, the film collapses and becomes more like a super boring book that you have to read in elementary school, where nothing happens literally for hours and where the battle scenes rival those of two children fighting on a playground. Omit cinematography, and this film belongs to the compactor. Films like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which was a good movie.
