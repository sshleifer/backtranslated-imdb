The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to be to start by plausibility by the window and continue on this path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a film that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are robbed by a gang of very "military" thieves. Two police officers are beginning to investigate this case which is quickly becoming more complicated than it seems at first sight. <br /> <br /> As usual in a Swedish movie, the cast is mostly made up of the same people you've seen many times. Mikael Persbrandt must appear in all Swedish films of recent years! But it does not matter, I guess since Persbrandt is one of the few to play hard here (as he usually does). The problems with this film revolve mainly around the story itself. First of all, burglaries seem to please. It's more like a film about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world (as was not done a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also a completely incredible twisting of the plot near the end that seems about as plausible as the landing of the Aliens. But I still thought it was a good idea, since I was half asleep at the time. This spiced things up a bit (and actually prevented the note from falling again). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is identical to that of most other Swedish films of this type. Simply that the action and suspense are not up to the standards we are used to other films of this genre (mainly Hollywood). He feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on intrigue and acting and forget about trying to do "Hollywood action" as they do now. Because this is still a forgettable effort of the Swedish film industry. I note 3/10.
