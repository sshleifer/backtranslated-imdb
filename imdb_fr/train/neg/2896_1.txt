I could not stand watching the whole movie. Do families like this really exist somewhere? Many comments have described this family as related to LLBean and other models, and I think it's an excellent description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> A more absurdly incredible writing / game happens when we meet a character In high school, she is called a "pig" who, of course, became a Harvard-educated 20-year-old plastic surgeon ( but only to do good in the world, not for money), and she sleeps Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I stop watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, you may enjoy this sentimental and complacent loss of time.
