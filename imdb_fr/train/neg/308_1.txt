Simple thoughts of "Going Overboard" (or "Ahoy Babes") make me want to cry. Throwing yourself out the window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed "so bad it's good" movie. I would spend money buying copies of this film and burning them so that people can not see it. Oh pain, pain ...
