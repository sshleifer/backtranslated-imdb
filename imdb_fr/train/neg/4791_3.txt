* spoliers * do not read further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Pick up after the depressing "Phantasm II" completed; The big man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and his newborn Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back, without being slaves to the big man's "red planet". It's really silly: the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse was there for comic relief, and the black karate girlfriend (I can not remember her name) was so annoying that I could not wait to to see if the great man was killing his character. It almost gives him the impression that it would be the character of Tim, who arrives late and is finally the hero, but ... it does not work like that. At the very end of this story, Liz is beheaded by the killer killers, Mike is implanted a silver sphere in his skull, Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and there is no one left to stop The Tall Man. The villain wins. Now, how is it going for a surprise surprise in the end? <br /> <br /> This film was shot in 1993 and was not released until 1995. The end of it was then final, and very disappointing and anti-climatic, it was also a appropriate and appropriate end for this strange little series. But the fourth changes this end and adds nothing new, but more bad jokes and an end even worse and more absurd ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
