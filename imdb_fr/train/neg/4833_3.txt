Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some brilliant Oscars from Avatar simply because the politicians wanted another movie about the heroes of the war to reinforce the acceptance (support?) Of the wars. The United States is still fighting today. I do not really want to play politics, but hey, it's clearer than the summer sky. Hurt Locker is really nothing exceptional, no real plot. I really feel in the 50s of Hungary when the party told people what to like or not. The same propaganda films were produced at that time, except that they were in black and white. Even if we consider this title as a reasonable piece of the genre "American wars are cool", you surely have better films to choose from.
