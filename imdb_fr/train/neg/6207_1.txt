This film commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film would have been a sensation among Cannes critics, but for me the final scene was a pathetic attempt for a new filmmaker to get noticed. Barely a voice in the discussion of the issue of violence, drug addiction or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis of the main character from a good troubled boy to a vicious rapist is almost non-existent, while the scene of rape (an exaggerated version of the rape scene from "A clockwork orange" ) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are certain things an artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: shocking, brutal, revolting and not worth your time. See "A mechanical orange" or "The pianist" instead.
