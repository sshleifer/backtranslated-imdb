I should have known that I had problems with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words can not describe, they do not do justice to the terrible horror of this film. But let me try to describe it: horrible action game, dreadful dialogue, difficult situations and through all this, you get the impression that you are force-fed by the beliefs and propaganda of Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a faint attempt to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message. They have failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
