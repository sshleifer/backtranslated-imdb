When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. In addition, it is possible that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unknown to the public. <br /> <br /> The 1973 television version of "Double Indemnity" features scenes and dialogues almost identical to those of the original 1944 version. The main difference is that the remake seems to have no energy. Fred MacMurray was brilliant in the role of the lush insurance agent, Walter Neff, in the original; Richard Crenna seems just exhausted and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought a great manic energy to his role as Barton Keys, MacMurray's boss; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, seems almost bored by the procedure. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this nasty role, Eggar is too polite and mannered and just seems out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as boss of Robinson, Norton, and John Fiedler taking the role of Porter Hall as a crucial witness, give a little life to the film. In particular, Webber recreates the role of Norton well in a context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the beginning of the film, everything is in a sense there, without life or electricity. It's a movie that should never have been redone.
