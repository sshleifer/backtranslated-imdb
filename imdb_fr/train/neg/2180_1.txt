Where to start, there are so many wrong and horrible things in this movie that I do not know where to start. Ok, the two guys who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first, they could not get an idea. I guess they divide the difference, that's why the main title is BRAIN WITH WOULD NOT DIE, but the final screen says HEAD WITH WOULD NOT DIE. Nobody knows anything about the medical profession. After all the doctors take an oath to "do no harm". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harm". Plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. The rejection would mean death for Jan in the pan. More that keeps a patch work monster. From which school did Bill graduate, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, it drives me crazy. In addition, the brilliant surgeon Dr. Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a patient sedated? All of a movie disaster, it's incredibly stupid and unassailable, except on MST3K. I give him TURKEY MERCIANTE.
