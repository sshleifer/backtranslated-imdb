THE. WORST. MOVIE. ALREADY. MADE. <br /> <br /> After watching this so-called gay movie, I suspect that someone captured a half-blind neo-Nazi and made him make the worst gay movie of all time, as part of of a deceived attempt to attack the gay culture. I had to stop the film and call a friend to watch me when I interrupted, shocked, incredulous and indignant at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot, it's just a bad movie. A dog with a handycam attached to the tail could have been better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews of this movie, I guess the author must own half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film is even viewable other than as a joke, is a liar or is heavily paid to say it.
