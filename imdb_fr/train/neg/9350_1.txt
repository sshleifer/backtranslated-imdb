This movie was terrible. The first half-hour looks a lot like ... well, excuse me for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied of one of the first Clockwork! Supposedly, it was a tribute, according to the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the wall of the protagonist, but "scam" is the most appropriate word. The film seemed to be torn by Kubrick's classic, filmed only through the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when he stops his massacre of Kubrick's work, the movie gets even worse. As another commentator put it, the depth of this movie just plunges you into the throat. Arrogant, egocentric and ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strays of the protagonists would touch a nerve if there was a real development of the character in this film. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I guess if someone could feel something for him, it would be me. Character development, intriguing dialogue and intrigue. <br /> <br /> The worst of this movie is its title. For a film titled "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is not an important factor in the film. See the first paragraph - it was such a massacre of a mechanical Orange that I can not overcome. "16 Years of Violence" or, better still, "A mechanical banana", would be more appropriate. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this film. If you disregard my advice and go out anyway, drink. Believe me.
