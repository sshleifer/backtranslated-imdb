Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates to go to) and spends a weekend with his friends. These are the usual white belly types of the middle class, who are successful in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to amuse in Woody Allen's comedies, but here he really falls flat on his stomach. Even the one-liners seem to have abandoned it. There's really no plot (aside from Shakespeare cod pieces) - but Allen seems to use the site to allow a semi-mystical look, which makes the thing even more devious and half-cooked. <br /> <br /> It does not work at any level and is just a giant trouble. The best thing about this movie (aside from the next end credits) is that the bad reviews seem to make it wake up and realize that just staging a slapdash script and putting it in the skin of your friends does not constitute entertainment.
