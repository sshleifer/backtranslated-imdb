Townies is the laziest movie I've ever seen and I saw Blair Witch's movies (first and second part). It seems confused in what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for the drama, it's not bloody enough for the horror and it's not good enough to watch. There are scenes of a man doing karate "awesome", so this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then he interferes in a drama about a missing girl, a retarded woman (mental handicap) and a trusting mother. Then he finds himself in the ONLY good part of the film, which seems to be organized as a sitcom without the funny pieces. The part I'm talking about is a solitary TOWNIE who is so lonely that he finds solace in a rotting corpse. This is the only part of the film that brought me ANY feeling. The rest was a size of my life. Then, just to show CRUEL Wayne, there's some kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's movie (the director) mocking Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne movies) are not the best, they are at least thought enough to entertain you until the end credits. I even like a little Killer Nerd, it contains some great lines that I still use to this day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like the movies above ground and if you like to watch your feet, rest where they are, you will not like the TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (on ****) <br /> <br />
