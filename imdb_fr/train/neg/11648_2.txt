As if there were not enough at the time, we have here another lame clone of GODFATHER of the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) that I had observed earlier this year. Telly Savalas is the star brand of this period, she enters late in the procedure and is seen for the first time from behind, looking rather at her flowers carefully and wearing a beret in the manner of French painters! In addition to not appearing a Sicilian minimum, he wears no accent of any kind, except his familiar sled. Antonio Sabato, then, made for an unlikely gangster - besides being a resistible ruler; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in the blink of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he later becomes an affair with the spirited teenage niece of the latter)! In addition, for a gangster film, there is little valuable action to speak of and none of this is memorable (although the finale in a clinic is sufficiently well managed); In addition, the score of Francesco De Masi is usable but nothing else. Incidentally, the DVD on the discounted market that I rented starts in the middle of the credits, so that no member of the cast - or even the title of the movie - is ever listed!
