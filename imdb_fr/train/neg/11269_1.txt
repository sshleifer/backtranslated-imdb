I must admit having seen some howlers in my day, but this one is among the worst. Disturbing terrain to follow. Sex and violence generated to disorient and distract from the film really badly mounted. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the distribution will look at the final product and wish it to be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
