When you watch this show, you are not sure if it's the story or the acting that is more boring. First of all, the scenario of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used all possible clich√©s, you can guess not only the general plot, but also the arrangement of the scenes and lines of each character, which gives to the spectacle of a collage of each police series there. At the top of all this comes the "message" of the show, that the good ones are good and the bad ones are bad and that finally the good will prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all in the way the most ostensible. The actors, as the medium of this message and nothing else, will use a limited set of skills at stake: the smile "I am a good bearer", the concerned look and the "victory is our posture", while the the bad guys have the frown "I'm a bad guy" and the "you caught me" look, followed by the headband "I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society" (this also sums up the development general of each show). Whether the story is true or not, the show is hogwash, further evidence that producers are not interested in viewers, that we are all supposed to be idiots. Well, this series does its best to idiotize the living brain of you.
