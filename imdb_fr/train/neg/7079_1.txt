No reason to bother renting this movie. From the opening credits, I knew I had a problem. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it was a soft porn movie, but there is really nothing erotic about it. The look at the world of sexual addiction is intriguing, but only on one point. <br /> <br /> The boring sex scenes, the plot and the cameos of Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this film.
