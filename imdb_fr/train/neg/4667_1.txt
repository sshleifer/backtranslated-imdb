Visually cluttered, intriguing less, incredibly stupid. Not even near the best work of Greenaway. To avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping "split-screen" effects only confuse, the film is very dark for most of the time and the "artistic" composition of images is pretentious to the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even the nudity is incredibly sober, and seeing the movie occupy a large part of the movie quickly becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> In addition, how can anyone say that the game of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant beyond me. He showed more skill in the Star Wars series, which says a lot. <br /> <br /> I have not been so impressed by a movie since I saw "Darby O'Gill and the little people"!
