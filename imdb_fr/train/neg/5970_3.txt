Coyote Ugly might have been much more effective if the filmmakers had made a R / R movie about it (with a lot of nudity.) But as the PG-13 rating is what all the studios want to finish with a movie like this: a movie "tease" PG-13 that has no right to go as far as the film should be gone. <br /> <br /> The script is generic. it's easy to guess which point of the plot will occur 15 minutes before that happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so fine that nothing can be done with them. There were also a lot of points where it seemed to me that I was watching a video clip rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only assets of the film are her incredible female heads. We come to see them in extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits ..... but we can only show a lot because of the constraints of the PG-13. There are many cleavages and tonic and catchy bodies that perform well-choreographed dance numbers, but there is no nudity or sex to speak of. Tyra Banks (she is getting incredibly beautiful with age) has also been in the movie for a very short time. The sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy to watch (and she has a murderous smile) and shows real gaming potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this movie please are meadow boys -pubers are still not allowed to watch R-rated movies. This audience could get a lot of titillating, but the adult audience will feel upset and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: the movie-1 the women-10
