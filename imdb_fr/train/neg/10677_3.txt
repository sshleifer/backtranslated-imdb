I rented End Game, I've never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I'd try it. After doing some research on the film, I found that it was originally intended for a theatrical release but was instead spent on DVD. After seeing it, I thought, "No wonder." The film is shocking in its non-originality. The plot and the characters are superficial. I understood Whodunnit halfway but the end was a curved ball. I must say that I did not expect everything to end as planned, but it is not an argument in his favor. The more predictable end would have been better than the bad one. The filmmakers may have seen how predictable the film was and therefore decided to take a different turn, even if it made the film even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
