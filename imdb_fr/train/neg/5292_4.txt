I can not recommend this film as a date film. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived in an area in south-east London is a violent Bekettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell, frankly. In the center of it is Ray Winstone, who has already made this kind of character, but never so well. The movie begins with the ordering of drinks in a pub - that's all - and you're already trapped in the frustration, self-hatred and barbarity that it exposes in different ways during the movie . It's an acting lecture. <br /> <br /> Of course, stranded and dispossessed people need a wink in a drama like this and Kathleen Burke has made Winstone a long-suffering wife, who absorbs and finally rejects his unbearable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles plays his role as Billy, the son of the druggist who lights the fuse, although he has sometimes wondered exactly why he had let go. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, maximizing the claustrophobia of their Assumption Council. 4/10
