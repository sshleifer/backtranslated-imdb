Space Camp, which had the misfortune to be planned at the time of the Challenger accident, deserves such a chance. The "stars" make fun of the acting, Lea Thomson in fact returned, when asked more than his usual innocent smile with wide eyes, probably to hide his ludicrous attempts. The film is sometimes hilarious when it starts asking you too much. A little boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet, which breaks when too many orders are given him by hordes of dormitory clich√©s. "Jinx", this senseless and indestructible machine, is a major player in the ridiculous places of the film, which seems to be part of the short circuit of the 2001 team of the plane. I will not bore you with that, just say you can only laugh in the face. That said, it's nice to watch, in the same way, a SeaQuest, Saved by the bell. Romance and technology, beware, are as incredible as each other. Also, if you are a monster of the eighties, it is essential for the fun performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie Temple of Doom) and, of course, Lea Thompson. In addition, Joaquin Phoenix plays a tricky trick as a kind of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not go near this movie if you're not a fan of trash.
