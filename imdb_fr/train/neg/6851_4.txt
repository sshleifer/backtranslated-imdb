Feh. This film started in an interesting way, but quickly went from confusion to sadness. The confusing parts appeared mainly at the beginning, where the editing scenes are so numerous that it's hard to tell what's going on for the first twenty minutes or so. The sad comes later, with a lukewarm romance between the two living people (both). The revenge of the dead girl is actually the liveliest person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast had been up to scratch, the movie could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the scenario becomes very interesting for a while, because it seems that the mother, the crazy priestess, of the 16-year-old girl who died is trying to resuscitate her daughter, with the regrettable side effect of the return of all the other dead . Plus, take a solid human form and probably start killing everyone. A sort of Japanese mystical thing of the Night of the Living Dead type. But that does not happen. Even if this unwashed hairless priest with a tiny basket attached to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does it exactly and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter. No mass of the dead, no army of corpses, nothing. The priest only brings back the spirit of the girl to the land of the dead, carrying with her the faded suspicion of a boyfriend, for she had crushed his spine like a brittle peanut (at that moment, I was tempted to cheer him loud, The idiot went to kiss and caress the DEAD girl, ewwww !!!). Robitussen's best friend sucking and thornless has a long introspective ball at the end as she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real goosebumps, what the Japanese tend to do much better than American filmmakers with a focus on cheesy face makeup, without screaming mimis. I was very disappointed.
