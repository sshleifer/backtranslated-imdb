A group of us watching this movie were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character, Jo, was not part of it (it's not like the writers / producers could do anything about it). The writing was mediocre, the script was below normal. What REALLY pissed us off: 1. When the two guys realized that they were both dating Natalie, they did not just endure this silly (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were competitive guys wanted Natalie. 2. Although she can not choose between the two guys before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides that she really likes one of the guys and is now ready to marry her? (and there was nothing to suggest that he was really a better guy, it's as if the writers were turning a coin and then spitting it out at a convenient time in the film). 3. Blair wants to point out that she does not want children, and suddenly, when her husband says he wants to have children, she agrees with him.
