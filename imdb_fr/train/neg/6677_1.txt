After reading the first 5 critics on IMDb, this film excited me. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see with the extraterrestrial is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a cheap suspense), the acting is above the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> The story does not seem to go in a way, first they capture the stranger (after 7 years they finally succeed), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years? ) and even want to free him (why the hell did they capture him?). Then, the girlfriend, who is the most off-the-wall comedian, wants to get out of this madness, then suddenly she does not do it, then again, she does it and then she does not do it. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien is going to kill the whole human race (and remember that over all these years, no other human being has seen these aliens permanently settled) and what do -they? They torture her and blow up a gang of strangers. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very fast, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
