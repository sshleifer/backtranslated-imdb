I saw it at the UCSB Reel Festival and I was * shocked * to win the Golden Reel Award. I was not the only one, considering that the audience had mixed reactions to the play. I thought there were many other best movies out there, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted in the field of film theory and other artistic hogwash. Although cinematography and editing are at the height of many other short films, stories are nothing more than the average student piece. It seems like "serious" student films have to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide - Nick and Kate escape and include all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and that could be the opinion of my underdog, but the guy from Montecito sounds a bit wrong. Is anyone else?
