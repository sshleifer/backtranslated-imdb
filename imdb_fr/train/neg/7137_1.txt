The cars in this movie are great. The game in this movie is awful. The plot and the driving scenes do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you are really bothered by the movies where someone passes and suddenly becomes ridiculously faster, do you save money and trouble. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a driver of a rally car. If you can not tell the difference, go watch it, you'll have fun. In summary, there are really some really nice cars in this movie, they are horribly driven and are completely unrealistic. The acting is horrible mainly because of the very bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such beautiful cars are represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were to match that of the film, they should run with rusty bikes.
