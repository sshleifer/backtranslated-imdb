I really did not have high expectations and I must admit that I was not disappointed. This movie is so terrible that I felt compelled to create an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time. The scenario is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the film "can this be worse?" Yes he can! they somehow make things worse every minute and you end up saying "I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!" Someone has to pay for it! <br /> <br /> I challenge you to find a movie that is worse than that ... <br /> <br /> I really did not have high expectations and I have to admit I do not I have not been disappointed.
