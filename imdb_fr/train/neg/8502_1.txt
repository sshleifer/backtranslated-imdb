I think at the beginning it's an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in a current Madrid, but that's none of it. It's actually an interesting movie only for future filmmakers who want to learn not to make a movie. In other words, even the presence of a winner of an Oscar (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent to see this film, the acting is awful and it seems that the actors were waiting just to finish the day. Gunshots to get home, that leads nowhere and is boring, weak and bad, do not waste time or money on this movie.
