I have read comments that you should not watch this film if you are trying to spark Shakespearean dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the moving dialogues in this beautiful piece have been cut and replaced by songs. I read this piece and recently I was lucky to see it play. It's still one of my favorite Shakespearian comedies, but this movie seems to carry away everything I love. The princess, although doing what she was supposed to do, had no royal attitude and all the girls seemed to lose the intelligence of their characters - also affected by imprudent cuts, which carried off not only the already scarce female characters, but took the comments out of context - it was a bit confusing to hear the princess proclaim; "We are wise girls to make fun of our lovers, then!", While we were not making fun of it at all. The news throughout the film also disrupted the flow and won many excellent scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes that followed and were written in a modern way. In conclusion, an excellent piece, marred by a strange concept, and imprudent cuts. Kenneth, I usually like what you do. What were you thinking?
