It was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to watch it. Almost all the actions were demotivated in the context of the film, the acting was really mediocre (P.Diddy was the best actor who really talks about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links with Carlito's Way were acceptable, such as his dream of moving to the Caribbean one day, but they were generally weak. The love interest in my opinion was completely wrong but hey, it's debatable. Anyway, I really did not expect much before watching the movie and I guess you can say that even those expectations have not been met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). However, he is lucky because I'm sure there will not be many people watching this movie. I usually give the films a decent rating if they arouse my interest. I will give them two stars. More luck next time. And yes, I liked Carlito's Way.
