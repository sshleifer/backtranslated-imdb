Terrible use of stage cuts. All continuity is lost, whether by terrible scripts or a lethargic direction. This nasty robot ... must be a jazz dancer? In addition, one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues are usually drowned in music.) And ... where did they find their props? This boat looks like a milk box ... At 13, I was doing better special effects on 8mm! <br /> <br /> I would recommend any film student to watch this movie (5 minutes at a time), like learning not to produce a movie. Or ... was it the publishers fault? <br /> <br /> It's really a shame, because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly executed. (Sorry Malcom, you should have sent a "double." You're too good an actor for such a stink bomb.)
