For your sake, it would be better to disregard positive reviews about this movie. This movie STINKS. Now, I like (at least in theory) low-budget horror movies, but this is the worst mistake a low-budget movie can make: it takes itself too seriously. And, unfortunately, that's not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murder of the Beane clan of the British Isles transposed to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that immediately puzzle this movie once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why the biggest name in the CD box Jenna Jameson? She has a lower than average appearance and can not act. She plays a minor role. ANSWER: She's apparently a well-known porn star (as you've probably read in other magazines already), so I guess it's a "cameo" for her. She gives the film a much needed "name recognition", it seems. His record is not an indication of his talent, but an indication of the lack of talent of the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> # 2 - How can filmmakers be so stupid to think that Canada can be spent like Ireland? It does not even look like Ireland at a distance. And the house where the guests / victims are staying is this great Edwardian with a North American wood frame. They should have ignored Beane's entire theme and developed a story that took place in NA. Plus, if you want to make a movie that's happening in Ireland, it's probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and it was an Irish accent REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD.) That would not have was so serious if the director did not try to do the next "Night of the Living Dead", but it seems he was. Pity. He could have had fun with that. In fact, some scenes are not far from being comic inadvertently. <br /> <br /> As in the infamous scene, the woman is chained to the table, undressed, then sliced ​​and open eviscerated. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer goes out a mile and a mile from the intestines. It's really funny after a while. And what self-respecting cannibal eats bowels anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck, we eat hams, ribs and drumsticks. Oh good. <br /> <br /> Some of the other actors who have been boring: Howard Rosenstein whiner. I'm not sure, but I think he was supposed to play the role of STUD. In fact, he is as big loser and blunder as the name suggests. Which would explain why the character of the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb, and it's apparently important to know that she got her bachelor's degree with honors. I can not decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduation, the honorary student performs naked soft-core pornographic scenes in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if his former classmates saw this movie? If this is the case, they will receive the message, hopefully: AVOID THIS DEATH! GO TO THE UNIVERSITY!!! I could go on and on, but why? If you like gore, you'll find something to redeem in this movie, but not much more.
