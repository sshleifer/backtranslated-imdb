Why? Because for a reason, there has never been a scene as adorable in a film as Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She takes it back at the end too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Praise him and see. Even if that's all you're watching. You will agree, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Everything in the original was so excellent that it did not require any remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers of this new version gave their "everything", but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it just can not be done! It's even annoying to find yourself mentally comparing the two when you try to enjoy the remake, and that falls by the way, without any fault of the actors.
