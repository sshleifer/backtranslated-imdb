The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known that it would be wrong if the phrase "Guaranteed to offend" was written on the box ... which means that the filmmakers will focus more on getting fatter than making you laugh. <br /> This film is an amateur mix of childish skits, bad characters and worse jokes ... from the pathetic sketch of Bat-Man to the painfully non-funny sketch of Arnold Shvollenpecker, they just are not funny. The few funny sketches are rare - see Micheal Clark Duncan as a gay virgin, for example - but even they last too long and are ruined by Vince Offer's inability to comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the Underground underground underground movie ... Bury it!
