Jeremy Northam is fighting a "Total Recall" clone script and a disposable romantic game to bring a confused character to life. Lucy Liu goes from a wooden start to a worker-type finish. You can not miss laughing by watching her interviews on the DVD when she uses the terms "femme fatale" and "Romance". French black filmmaker, she is not and they lack chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or in the action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in photography and viscous films. representation of the technological world surrounding the main protagonists. There is little attempt to dress the landscape to represent a landscape or a contiguous film period. Cars date back to the 90's and barely modern architecture with open plans that suggest a limited budget rather than conscientious dressing techniques. <br /> <br /> The technology is really hilarious. Massive central computers "2001: a space odyssey", powered by portable CD-ROMs containing data collected for an unexplained reason, despite the proliferation of the communications network that even the least informed technologist would obviously be aware of put in place. There is a clear lack of research done here and, given the open nature of the cyber-community, searches would have cost little more than a scoreboard and personal time. <br /> <br /> The DVD interviews also reveal the original. The name of the movie was "Company Man", but it was probably dropped to take advantage of Matrix's hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest connection with the film. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely rewrite the decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the Tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for long-term production. This could have been a good sub-plot for "Alias".
