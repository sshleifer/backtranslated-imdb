Why did I waste my money on the last day of Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I recover my $ 16? While watching this movie, I was still waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way for me to know what it was to read the plot, which did not really look like the movie. why did the director zoom in with his camera and zoom out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu who did not care about his nails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors try to speak when they seemed to read? Or was it the goal? I felt like Phantom Love did not have a story, and to be honest, I felt that my friends' vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this movie.
