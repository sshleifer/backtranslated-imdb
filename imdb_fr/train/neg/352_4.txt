It seems that the cast should ensure at least one average film. And so I sat for 102 minutes of disbelief. Apart from Ed Harris, no one seems to have the acting skills. Even Sean Connery, whom I normally worship, must have had a day off during the entire Just Case shoot. Not once in all the film, an actor could not convince me. <br /> <br /> This gave this film an unreal and cheap appearance. <br /> <br /> The story invents a little. It's exciting and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion Do not watch this film unless you really have nothing more to do.
