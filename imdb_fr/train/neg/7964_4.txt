"Creepshow 2" is just a pale imitation of the original, designed for a purpose other than to take advantage of the name of the previous movie. It even amplifies the faults of its predecessor, often predictable and heavy. Nevertheless, the first time there was enough chills to make up for its periodic lulls, giving rise to an uneven but quite amusing effort. As the sequence has few interesting moments, the transparency of the stories is even more apparent. From time to time, this keeps its promises, but most of the time, it lingers there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and desserts. A wooden Indian comes alive, taking revenge on the killers of his owner. Teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist. None of these premises are inherently bad in themselves, but they are totally lacking in inspiration. There are few surprises and no fright. This is a classic example of making unmotivated movies and numbers. It does not help that this cheap-looking movie suffers from a flat director style, although to be honest there were not many things to work with. In the end, the second story is better, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are at best correct. George Kennedy, as the unfortunate owner of a general store, does an adequate job, or even particularly inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, behaves rather well as a guilt-ridden motorist, arousing sympathy for her difficult situation despite predictable and redundant redundant equipment. However, most characters are rather skinny. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to the screenplay, based on other stories by Stephen King. Makeup artist Tom Savini does good blood work. So, why is the movie disappointing? I guess Romero did not really want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, clone, scam, etc., so it was definitely inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, pick up his paycheck and run away. I suppose he had to do what was necessary for his own projects to be funded; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (on ****) <br /> <br /> Posted by New World Pictures
