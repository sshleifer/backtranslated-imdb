Raising Victor Vargas is just a bad movie. Nothing of denial nor advertising supported by advertising dollars to change this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett may have seen that he did not have the money to make the movie he wanted to make and decided to choose the easy way out by making a bad movie that makes to sound cynically the current principles of "edgy filming". Maybe he just does not know better. It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. Apart from a few spectators who will intellectualize the bad film making in an attempt of pseudo-realism, few will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I know I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself and pass on this film.
