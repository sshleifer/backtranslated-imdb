Yes, this movie draws a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the genre of adult film. Still, I did not like that at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more appropriate for a horror movie, she is offered the opportunity to return briefly to earth to live the life of lust she has never experienced before. Shit sex scenes to follow. Why are they crappy, for one they are trying so hard to be artistic that they are removing the actual sex act. I mean we're looking at porn for sex, are not we? Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it's still very erotic and fun to watch. Of course, the girls of this one are very cute. Here we have an unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. If you find that the thread of your adult film is unattractive, no artistic vision will make me love the movie. The sex scenes go from yuk to weird ... I mean, there's a snake in one of them. So, for me, this film fails because it does not excite me at all, but disables me.
