Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time under a different character. Nobody on board seems to notice - maybe it was hair. Anyway, this time, it is not the receptacle of a god (see the previous episode), but a very famous woman with magical powers that allow him to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (standard human response). Unfortunately, the man who loves him the most is a few cards away from a complete game and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly enough, lives in a petty cash - it's an ugly way to travel) . And, unfortunately, Muldayr is not very well hurt herself. What happens next is a bit silly and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men aboard ga-ga on Muldaur was pretty silly, and the game of Spock's actors when he briefly went crazy was rather campy. Do yourself a favor - if you've never seen the show before, choose another episode.
