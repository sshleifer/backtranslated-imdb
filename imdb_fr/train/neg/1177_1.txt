This movie is complete shit! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is disjointed and incoherent. I'm proud to be immersed in the depths of 70s cinema, from Salo to Kitty Lounge. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if watching guy's friends takes you away, this movie is for you. The saddest was that lame wolf costume with the functional wang. I mean it's just difficult to go unnoticed, not to mention that the acting is terrible and that the soundtrack is badly doubled. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (which looks like gorilla hands looking for a woman's bare ass), but do not waste your time and money because you will not get anything either.
