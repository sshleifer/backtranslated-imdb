This film, although apparently a comedy, is terribly serious. Its subject is imperialism (with a capital I): how Britain tries to convince herself stupidly, humbly, that she is still a great power after the Second World War. At home, the empire is ruled by kind dolts, benevolent conservatives who are so well educated that they can not distinguish close relatives; the government offices are made up of long-forgotten archives (an Orwellian paranoid search?), inhabited by indolent rats, and antechambers in which synacures are lounging, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> old pump; but the pomp out of context seems worn and ridiculous, especially when it is embodied by fools. Carlton-Browne is a picture of shameless decline, without the tearful rot that has tainted the so-called anti-imperialist Crown Jewel. <br /> <br /> The film also talks about the cold war, bravely admitting that it is a dangerous joke, whose participants deserve scorn and contempt, not fear and respect. It explains how colonialism, characterized more by negligence than by tyranny, destroys the settlements it deserts, depriving them of amenities, power and, above all, self-respect, making them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys. . <br /> <br /> It's serious, of course, that kills him. That's not to say that weight matters can not be dealt with in comedy - the miracle of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelove and Brian's life have all proved it. Indeed, one could suggest that serious themes should be treated only by comedy - this allows for a clearer vision. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation must have a meaning beyond the simple comic, so that it becomes heavy and not funny. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy stems from the character's reaction to an extreme situation, and not from the extreme situation itself. Here, the screenplay is too poor to allow rich comic characterizations and some of the greatest comedy talent ever - Peter Sellers, Terry Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John the Mesurier - are criminally empty. <br /> <br /> Terry-Thomas, sublime so often, shows that he did not know how to handle the main parts and that he needed to play silly and arrogant terminals, not brainless toffs. The music is meant to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on the screen. (To be honest, unlike most of the British comedies of this period, which were shaky and under-produced, the Boultings often try to assert their point of view by the film itself, by editing and composition. Huntley manages to provoke real bursts of laughter, a character he could have played in his sleep. <br /> <br /> None of the Boultings pranks has been well dated, it has never been thought enough Although Carlton-Browne admires the decline of the Empire, he also seems to be undemocratic and militaristic, I'm sure it was not planned, but these mistakes are inevitable if you let praiseworthy intentions prevail over comic intelligence. and the shape of a movie.
