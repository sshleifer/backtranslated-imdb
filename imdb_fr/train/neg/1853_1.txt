This film, no correction, this thing, this abyssal abomination of inflamed hells should have been killed even before leaving the head of the writer. I may not be able to find enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, shit, inducing vomiting, ripping brutally, hideous, hideous, naughty, putrid, there are not enough words in English! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, not important. The killer snowman is talking about killing people. You may be wondering how a snowman can kill someone? In a tasteless way that makes you want to remove your eyes if only to no longer have to endure this polystyrene snowman. In a way that makes you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure its snow games anymore. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it on sight! For the sake of your soul, do not look at it!
