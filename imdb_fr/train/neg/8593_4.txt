Well, I finally saw it. I did not go there on the first day because, frankly, I was scared. Fear of his gravity or disappointment. Although not as bad as Menace and better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting at the theater. From the first round to the final credits, it was a cinematic experience that I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm boy who knows he is destined for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat while being mentored by the wise wizard, the villainous pirate and the various comic reliefs - all in one space setting of the opera. <br /> <br /> And this is not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave him new twists that made him very special. <br /> <br /> Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness came on the scene and we learned one of the most beautiful twists of all time. The big bad guy, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw that coming. Of course, I'm sure Lucas did not do it until it appeared in the script. Return to Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, see if it really rakes. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining film - extraordinary effects, lots of action, good fight scenes. But a film lives or always dies on its plot - the story it tells. Oh, certainly, a very good acting game can save a weak conspiracy, but a weak plot associated with a bad game - it's a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize that George Lucas is (the man has Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already handicapped by what happened in the first two movies, so it's an incredible burden. One too much to overcome. <br /> <br /> First we have the absurdities of the background. Anakin was found a child in Tatooine, the product of a virgin and miraculous birth - the "chosen person". Well, this detail is never explained remotely. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that they may have been mistaken. Oh, all right, all right. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, this same people turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence! And he will come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that Test the old voluntary suspension of disbelief there, huh George? Anyway, we have this stupid kid, in a bad mood, petulant, young adult who moans, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in film history - the great tragedy of Darth Vader - the good guy who falls from grace, to finally achieve redemption at the end. <br /> <br /> How does this happen? Why, he dreams that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a civilization that covers all the stars and treats gravity in the same way as the essence, but does it make sense that the "evil man" might come to a doctor because maybe perhaps this futuristic society could do something about this problem? No, the only thing he can think of is to go kill children, because the villain at the base of all the evil they have been chasing for two movies tells him that he has the secret of immortality . <br /> <br /> Well, of course, he does it. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to observe such foolishness and be moved? How can we expect that we care? Why on earth would that kid be saved or redeemed in the first place? I wanted Kenobi not to kill him because he was mean, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala is finally dying. In childbirth. Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a droid and who is himself an indicator of the incredibly advanced technology that this company has advanced, offers only the conclusion that "she lost the desire to live". Well, of course, she did it. Perhaps she finally understood with what dweeb she slept. <br /> <br /> But here we are. Kenobi is present for all this. He is aware of the birth of Luke and Leia. Know who their father is and what happens to them. Also knows the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, while Luke is getting closer to adulthood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (oddly, the spirit of 3PO is wiped out, but not that of R2 - why ????) stating " I think these droids belong to you, "Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was built by the one he believed to be" the chosen one "and the apprentice of the emperor himself, and who has just found himself built on this very planet, says "strange, I do not remember owning droids". <br /> <br /> Oh, good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas just invented this as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, the story unfortunately began to get out of hand because he did not know what that story was about. The plot of episodes 1 to 3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine had rational sense. And none of this is related to the story he told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's an afterthought, and it looks like it's coming out. <br /> <br /> I can not give a very good rating to this movie. . It reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to watch, but totally forgotten. Star Wars will stay in my memory forever. Fortunately, this one and the two previous ones will be soon.
