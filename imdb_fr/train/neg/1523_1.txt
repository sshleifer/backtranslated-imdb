This 'film' must be the biggest pile of steam I've seen <br /> <br />, what more can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to save this movie and I pray that they NEVER talk about doing a sequel. If you plan to look at this, know that in history, two scavengers are trained to save the Earth. Movies like Men in Black have been torn apart and restored to make this "Comedy" but have TOTALLY failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
