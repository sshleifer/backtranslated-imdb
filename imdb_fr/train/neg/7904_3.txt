Ridiculous little boogers that moss spawn and breed. So far for the horror elements of this movie. All the rest of MUNCHIES is played like a comedy really delayed and so stupid that you will not find it funny after about 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids cheering for those little idiots, but only the adults supposed to be "smart" will be on screen, such as Captain Kirk's diary entries in STAR TREK, the most famous ET scene, a Blatant statement by directors: "Look, we are benefiting from GREMLINS success here!" and a cardboard cut from Clint Eastwood telling us ... and his western movies? The latter was totally lost to me ... Oh yes, and the elimination of chemical waste in the caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where this idea comes from. <br /> <br /> Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie in this respect. It's really, really stupid. And if you manage to smile while watching the movie, you will probably feel as stupid to have done it once the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Good bad guy? Yes, but only if "idiotic", "delayed" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, uh, uh, 6/10.
