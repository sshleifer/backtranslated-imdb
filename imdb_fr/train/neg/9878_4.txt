Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox" sparked a lot of love. Unfortunately, all this love is for himself. Admittedly, a lot of time and effort went into creating this universe as offbeat as itself, but if the same time and effort had been spent on the script to make it fun. What's worrying is that I thought so, and that's the best choice Wes Anderson has. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in close shots of animals, but when the camera is farther, everything becomes very hard for the eyes and, to be perfectly honest, it looks like a mess. The role of actor was not really special either, with Wes choosing to pick his buddies and big names on more specialized vocal actors who would probably have been able to improve the film. I'm sure George Clooney's resume consists of two appearances in South Park, one of which he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too beautiful and too hard to be clever and intelligent. Although the film takes place in England, all good animals are typically American and play baseball, while the bad guys are an English stereotype with the most insulting accents in English. I can not emphasize how much this film is a waste of time. I did not laugh once.
