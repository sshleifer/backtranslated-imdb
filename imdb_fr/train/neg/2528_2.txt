The Van is a good movie about a guy trying to lure girls into his new van to seduce them. The only thing that does not fail in this film is to describe precisely the van fashion in the United States in the late 70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. It's a garbage can, but I loved it! I must admit that I am a fan of the garbage of the 70s! I hope this one will reach the bottom of the IMDB 100 database! <br /> <br /> 2
