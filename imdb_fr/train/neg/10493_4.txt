A film difficult to classify. I never gave him a concentration of 110% and therefore as simple as the plot appeared, I can not say for sure who did what in the characters of the American FBI and what their roles were. I also could not take the Irwins seriously as movie characters when their lines and scenes were all in the style of one of his shows and were not played. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV. show, with a largely insignificant subplot happening, that just seemed to hinder. However, as any Irwin show is always worth seeing, this film is also worth a visit, but not Christmas Day. Speaking of that, I have better things to do than to be here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
