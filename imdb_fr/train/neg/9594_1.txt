I signed up for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished my film, and the only thing that impressed me was that I had the power not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a few action movies and the like, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most sword fights involve blindly swinging swords in the fourth and hoping the opponent does not do the same. I have seen many student movies with better action and stronger intrigues. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with mediocre action and virtually no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the film has no action and shows the evolution of the relationship between the princess and the farmboy / terrorist and her troubled sister. The film has many intrigues, and none of them are really worth it. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be that I watched dubbing, which was pretty bad. The entire cast mumbled all their lines, so it was hard to follow what was going on. But I had the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the film in my eyes.) <br /> <br /> If you've heard of this futuristic action / ninja movie, you've misunderstood. That's what I thought when I heard about it and I lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Avoid it well.
