Oh it really is. I've seen movies that I did not like anymore, for whatever reason, but I've never seen a film that fails in every aspect of making a movie. It fails even in the making of movies, as might be claimed by Hercules in New York. It's not the film I like least, but it's the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting game is the first thing that strikes you. I have never seen a worse movie played outside of pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic movies that are considered a damn better site than this one. It's really horrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera work is amateurish. The montage is absurd. I assume they could not afford the appropriate sound equipment, which meant that every scene in a car (and many of them) drove them about three miles an hour and that each scene was outside the same wood (and We nicknamed them in the studio, which gives even more to the bad atmosphere porn. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd, as many have stressed. vampires who walk in the light of day because, despite its popularization by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the myth of vampires. <br /> <br /> About the myth of vampires, the writer had obviously read Carmilla, or at least seen The Lover of Vampire Lovers.I am not sure what I feel about this, convinced that a film of this stature has at least some aspirations to a novel Gothic that I like a lot, or annoyed by his references at best the sledgehammer and the worst total desecration of the source material. At least "the general" is an insult to Peter Cushing though. <br /> <br /> But he gets two stars, just because I can not bring myself to vote a star for a movie that has, or at least claims to have both vampires and zombies. By the way, I watched Lifeforce (another movie that contains vampires and zombies) on the same day and, although it's a rather flawed film, it's a masterpiece compared to this one. <br /> <br /> So In the end, it's not such a bad film that it's good, or so nice, even drunk. It's just a mess, and not worth watching.
