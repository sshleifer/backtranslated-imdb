Okay, I saw the preview of this stupid movie. First of all, the film is so laid and not real, they all act. They can not sing. They are far too full of themselves. It's horrible. Yes, children ages 8 to 10 could enjoy it, but it's really stupid. I mean they say their manager is a kid. And here, the label is wrong. It's stupid. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> Regarding the set-up and direction, not bad. It's a cute documentary but documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See it only if you do not really like good music. In addition, it's very cheesy. It's not even good taste. I hate being so mean ... but it's really a junk.
