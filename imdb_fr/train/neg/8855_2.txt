Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. I admit that the movie about werewolves, rather good, started slowly, but grew to finish pretty well. The presenter turned into a cute werewolf, to be shot in front of the camera. Yes, that made it an entertaining horror movie ... well, forget about it, because this movie has nothing to do with this movie. Oh, of course, they make sure the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something else is trying to find out what and why things have gone as planned, but they are going from the cozy little retreat from the first film in Transylvania or somewhere where they have to fight evil werewolves or something like that. I often wonder what Christopher Lee was doing in the world in this movie. However, I read here an anecdote where it is said that he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but that I still read the script before playing a role. Maybe you could have gotten into "an American werewolf in London" that might have been possible. It was in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem very much in this movie, except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this film was for me when the first girl started talking loudly and that guy's ear began to bleed.
