I really wanted to love this movie, but he never gave me a chance. It's basically supposed to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. One always has the impression that it has been written and interpreted by high school students for a school project, and it is also the level at which the humor seems to aim. There is no subtlety and, more importantly, for a fake documentary, it never looks like a documentary. And although the lines are not funny in the first place, an attempt at flat delivery could have helped - certainly, everything would be better than the acute overexposure we are experiencing. <br /> <br /> I 'I recommend it to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are by nature hysterically funny. The others must stay away and not waste their time.
