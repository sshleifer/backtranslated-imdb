Still another Die Hard directly to the video ripped off with the cardboard villains ?? How many more of these ugly, cheap (and bad) devils stole the most popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s, are there still problems ? For the record (not that you really care), this is another glaring scam of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2, with a full range of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> Non-descriptive villains are the usual selection of cardboard cardboard boxes that are sent by different means as the film progresses, the hero is naturally an ex-cop or something that has family problems and attitude and of course, he brings to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a matching piece of treat for the eyes and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The so-called luxury cruise liner connecting Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry ?? this somehow explains why they seem to be fussing over a rusty ferry ferry ?? in New Zealand! The actors' game is as wooden as the deck, the scenario is lamentable, the liners are predictable, the villains are totally incompetent and the plot has holes in which you could get a boat. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a never-ending end to this tide of this sort of video scam polluting the nightly slits of TV and DVD supermarket bargains everywhere (although movie is so bad that it has not seen a DVD release yet, but give it time!) Is there a chance that something will be done at least half decently, semi-believable and most importantly ORIGINAL?!? No, I did not think ?? ..
