I could not believe my eyes once I watched this movie. There is no point either in blood or violence. Unlike other horror movies that made sense and gore, this movie is only blood, blood and killing one after the other. This film is not interesting at all, has no plot or history or intelligence. The blood looks very fake and this film as a whole is useless. Do not even waste your time with that. It's just an hour or two of senseless violence. There are many bloody scenes that are not scary but simply outrageous. It's probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen among all the horror movies I've seen.
