The St. Elmo's Fire youth group, which has just graduated from university, seems barely able to successfully complete high school education for less than four years at a renowned university. For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and dumb, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to think of them as a touchstone for a generation. With a distribution of "up and comers" now obsolete, a score that looks terribly like the "Terms Of Endearment" and a writing that dominates the sufficiency of this circle on us, "Fire" is a torch it becomes even more embarrassing to as the years pass. * 1/2 of ****
