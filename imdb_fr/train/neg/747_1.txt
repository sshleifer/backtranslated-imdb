Finally, I thought someone was going to do justice to H.G. Wells' classic, not another version placed in the wrong place or good time, but a version based firmly on the book. Well, he definitely follows the book very closely, and that's the only benefit of this mess. <br /> <br /> It's 180 minutes long (yes 3 hours), the book is only about 150 pages long. <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do better ...", I would say "yes, I could" and I have never used a video camera or been so be it. drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid a lot of money to bring this shit to the United Kingdom from the United States, do not make the same mistake as me.
