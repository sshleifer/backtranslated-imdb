This film surely has one of the strangest themes in history - just like Ed Wood's passionate defender in the movie "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> The subject: playing bridge. The game Park Avenue plays; the gypsies play there. Russians - who speak "Russian" very questionably and have unconvincing accents when speaking English - play it at the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in bridge, you - even in spite of the big distribution - will probably not be very interested in this strange film. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are doing well. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter - just as Lukas is an improbable Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishist scenario.
