The most misogynistic film of all time? Without speaking of 1968, should not they have gone beyond the whites with brown faces to play the "Indians"? My favorite parts should be when the girls laugh and blush when the bikers drag them to rape them. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then there are the blatant scams of "The Hustler" (the big boss character plays billiards while trying to destroy the Indians with the main rebel guy), the awful actor, the so-on-the- nose-they- musical clues, the lack of anyone who is truly Indian in this movie. And for whom are we supposed to be rooted? I must say that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Even if his films tend to defend strong women, at least one source tells me that in real life, he is a misogynist idiot. Why I looked at it, you ask? Do not ask.
