"Dan in Real Life" is not very interesting. First of all, the whole setup is incredibly artificial. Did you really believe that during this very long first meeting at the restaurant, Marie would not tell Dan where she was going? And since Dan talked about everything during this conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? Besides, I never understood why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is really a good guy (for example, he lies to Mary in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past friends and tries to make Mary jealous with a "meeting". you blindly "). There are more things like this ridiculous bowling scene where Dan and Marie are caught getting fucked by the whole family. Yeah, like it could really happen. Dan in real life is slow, sappy and manipulative. Even movies like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher ratings than this predictable "larmoyeur".
