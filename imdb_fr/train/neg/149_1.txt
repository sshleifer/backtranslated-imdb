Well, you know the rest! It must be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay for this role. <br /> <br /> The main role is played by (for me) an absolute unknown and I imagine that I am still gone after having this turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led the charge of martial arts in the early 70's and since then, combat scenes must be based on martial arts or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This film uses quick cuts to show the martial arts, however, even that can not hide the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a punch. An average 8-year-old boy would take it apart at this performance. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery that is exposed here is how it did not win the Golden Raspberry award for its year.
