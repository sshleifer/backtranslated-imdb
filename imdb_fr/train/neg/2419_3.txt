I just give him a three because it fulfills what my friends and I hoped he would do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to praise this idea thinking it would be a zombie movie with Romero or Fulci, but I praised it for laughing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for fun or a movie to shake your head with embarrassment, go for it. It's perfect for young fans of the "Mystery Science Theater", but the only drawback is that it's so bad that it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I feel it's a shame to relate this to another Hollywood title that we may be familiar with, because when a movie is nil, it has its genre.
