What is hysterical in this film is that, according to the director, he finds it difficult to find a distributor in the United States because most of those who viewed it could not reconcile the apparently contradictory messages of the Christianity and American anxiety. It is laughable to think that anyone who regards this as a religious film is a laughable thing. <br /> <br /> Because a minister of a mission prays with the homeless or wants someone to "hope" that it becomes a "Christian" film? It might be interpreted as making fun of religion in the "land of plenty" with all its material excesses. The best an organized mission can do is to distribute a bowl of soup and a verse from the Bible. Many unhappy or oppressed perhaps? Many unnecessary homeless missions? How about many veterans of psycho Vietnam? As an illusory survivor of the "pink" agent, should we think that America is a "country of plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Certainly, few people are worried about Palestinian politics based on the phone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, the unfortunate would be much more concerned with peace in a far country than with their own survival, because the world knows how much Europe is a "continent of abundance "in sophistication. <BR/> <br /> In fact, I ended up accepting the title because the United States is the "land of plenty" and, in this particular case, it refers to the abundance of bad scenarios , amateur actor films and unrealistic films. Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have a lot of time to lose to watch this play.
