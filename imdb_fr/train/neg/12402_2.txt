I always thought Andy Hardy's old movies were a little too cynical. Two of them were not bad. Modern movie critics are usually not those who prefer the nice to the mean, so shoe films like these are rarely praised. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can not defend this film either. You can always have a dated dialogue but always laugh and cry about the story. Looking at this, you just have to shake your head and ask yourself "how stupid can you be?" This is simpler than nerdy, if you know what I mean. It's so old-fashioned that I can not imagine too many people sitting for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of the traffic because he tells a story about involvement with a New York debutante as if it's was the ultimate. People were much more socially conscious in the past. You hear the term "social-climber" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the greatest achievement you can make live. Of course, it's quite absurd, and even more so today. <br /> <br /> However, this is a film and series as innocent as it is clean (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies). could find. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland singing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a few songs here and she makes her way into Andy's heart. Oh man, I almost vomited even writing about it!
