What a cast wasted. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert usually does not let me down, but I feel cheated after seeing him. movie. <br /> <br /> The only pleasure is to see Elizabeth banks in her bra. It's a sorry statement about this movie. It was so promising, but it felt like a transvestite was dry. <br /> <br /> It's a tripe that absorbs itself. <br /> <br /> I can not express enough my bitterness to have sat through this film. and hope to be able to warn you of the same disappointment.
