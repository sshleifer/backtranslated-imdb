I read all the Love Come Softly books. Knowing very well that movies can not use every aspect of the book, but in general they have at least the main purpose of the book. I was very disappointed with this movie. The only thing they have in this film that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit him (although in the book, both parents come). That's all. The story was so twisted and hard to find, and yes, sad, from the book, that I just could not enjoy it. Even though I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life was tough, but the whole movie was depressing. The rating is to have the same family orientation of the movie that makes them great.
