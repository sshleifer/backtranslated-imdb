Was it the biggest movie I have ever seen? It was the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it's nice to watch something light and fun. It was great, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think there was room for improvement, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this film deserves the extreme level of abuse of the other critic. They do not care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at it than in The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a huge role in the success or the flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast did not work. Maybe too much was happening. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to speak for an average film, not so good. It could be just a girls movie. A bit like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about it. :)
