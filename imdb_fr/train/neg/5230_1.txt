Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I do not belong to him. His films are simple and amateurish, and they are just not very fun, unless you're 14 years old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He's certainly not famous, as his immature fans would like, harassing Wikipedia on Wikipedia or rummaging through the votes here at IMDb. It is certainly not presented by the major media, which says a lot about the "notoriety" of its creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has a slight skill in limited animation, but he must move away from his youth. sycophants and learn to write funny material before it is taken seriously as an artist. From that moment, he's just a kid with a camera and it shows.
