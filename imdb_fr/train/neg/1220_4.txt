She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also nominated for the Razzie. Making a movie as bad should be an indication that she needs money. She could make announcements about why you should not talk on the cell phone while driving, especially at night, towards a crowded mall. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should stick to the production (Shoot 'Em Up) of her is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> She is approached by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell him they have a gun. What is she doing? She begins to push them and curse them as if she knew the martial arts. She manages to escape, but gets lost in the forest after crashing. Why did not she run to someone's house? We have four armed thugs who chase a lady with a toolbox. Of course, their weapons are no match for their key. Ha! Of course, she also has a tire changer and a screwdriver. These poor thugs. <br /> <br /> Now she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
