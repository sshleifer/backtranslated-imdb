There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, nothing; most clip shows try to at least attach the clips to the plot with a slender stretch, but that did not even do it. Clips, three lines that will lead to the next endless sequence of matte clips ... OK, so the production time may have been short, but it would have been better to skip that episode completely. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how that was done, actually. Scrubs is usually much better at subverting the tropes, but it still managed .... <br /> <br /> Thank god, they were back in shape for the next episode.
