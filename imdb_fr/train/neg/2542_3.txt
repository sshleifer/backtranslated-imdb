... not all Disney movies are waste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw in the first place "Legend of Boggy Creek" and I loved the movie. When I heard that there were 2 suites, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. I do not see how they can do a sequel to a horror movie with G-rated. The original is a film / documentary about the Fauke monster and can scare everyone. "Back" is for children and should not be viewed by anyone. I do not remember the plot very well, because I have not looked at it for a long time and I will not look at it anymore, but ... These are the hunters who come to town and are looking to kill Bigfoot. Three little children come out of the house to stop them. A big monsoon is coming. The hunters are wounded, they are saved by the children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large tarpaulin and try to wait for the storm. Suddenly, Bigfoot is doing something really sick. I do not want to ruin the end for any yas, but it's not scary. Well....
