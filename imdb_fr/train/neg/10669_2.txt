A set of uninteresting and inimitable characters sneak into a fragile plot that could be interesting, if only you could worry about it. I'm talking here about "spinning and spinning", not about the story (which contains all the suspense of a tuna casserole recipe), but about the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very pretty nostrils and a left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the film is the big names they convinced to do it. If you consider that this film has never been released indoors despite a distribution of stars, you may be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And yes, that's the case.
