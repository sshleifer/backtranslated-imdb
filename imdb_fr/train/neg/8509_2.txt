I saw this film for several reasons, the main being Mira Sorvino. With her on the casting, it could not be so serious. And it even seemed like there was a mystery and Olivier Martinez was his boyfriend at the time and he was very good at `Unfaithful '. The story is happening in Spain, so it could be an exotic and entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you plan to do the same thing, let me warn you: it's really horrible, no interest, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to my mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is artificial with secondary intrigues that add nothing to the story. They try to build a thrasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain but fail horribly. The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are thin! I did not care about anyone. More than that, they are irritating and rather hateful people. <br /> <br /> The action is atrocious. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep a certain dignity! His character was weak, but it's not an excuse for such a terrible performance. She seems dozing all the way through the movie. When I think about it, I even think I saw his eyes slowly close in some scenes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to watch a little skin, try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And this accent? My god ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I have suffered enough from this waste. <br /> <br /> All this movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way that it's amazing to see how it was done. A lousy team to produce a lousy scenario and make money with the name of the actor. Fear nothing. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
