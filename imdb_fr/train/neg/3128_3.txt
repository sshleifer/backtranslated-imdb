... this horrible movie! There are so many problems with this film: acting, writing, directing, editing, etc. that it is amazing that something is rising to the top and proving to be the worst. The music! I noticed that the film has two composers listed. That must be the reason why every image has music, the absolute worst "D" of movie style. They have never heard of the phrase "less is more". It became so painful to listen, I cut the sound whenever there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You must be sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they have not seen such roles at the twilight of their careers. See at your own risk.
