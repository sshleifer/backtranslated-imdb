Sistas in da hood. In search of revenge and bling bling. Except da Hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s. I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil 'Kim, he could say, "Okay, I have to admit I just listened to her." Nude stockings and low-rise blouses are not the staple of the cowboy movie -boy usual, but these are the cowgirls, and they're fine. <br /> <br /> Now, do not look for a major story here, and the usual ghetto crime story is in context And when did you last hear John? "Wayne calls someone," Dawg "? And I do not remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before heading to the OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at this on BET, so I missed the action that happened.This is a R note, but I doubt that I will buy the DVD to see it, at unless I can rest assured that it was Lil 'Kim in this action.
