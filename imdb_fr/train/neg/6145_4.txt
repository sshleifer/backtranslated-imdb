Although I saw "Gymkata" at the movies in 1985, I only remembered the plot as vague pictures of Kurt Thomas running and fighting on a stone wall background and disappointed at the end. <Br/> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I picked up a copy of the recently released DVD to re-enter the world of Gymkata. <br /> <br /> It turns out to be one of those movies produced during the '80s that would go straight to the video today. The film champion Kurt Thomas, the film champion, plays Jonathan Cabot, recruited unexpectedly to infiltrate the nation "Parmistan" and enter, with a little luck, in "The Game", a sports suicidal sponsored by the Khan who encourages his people by shouting "Yak Power." The purpose of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks and never leaves home. Once formed, try to blend in with locals wearing a bright red sweater with touches of blue and white. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life in the cobblestone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a rendezvous with fate and the game. <br /> <br /> The star, Kurt Thomas , was poorly served by director Robert Clouse, who seems he has never been on the set. The script says is right on this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers. The crazy city has some good times, but is eventually ruined by a bad edition. The end ... meh. Stay the seed of a good action adventure here. A version of Hong Kong with a more visceral action and a faster pace could even be very good.
