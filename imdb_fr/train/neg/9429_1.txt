I bought this movie for $ 5 in a used CD store and I regret it a little bit. I will start by saying that I am a big fan of horror movies with cheese. They provide a horribly tacky entertainment cheap. This film was entertained during the first half-hour because it was so difficult to make fun of the MST3K style. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> The acting game is the scariest part of the movie. Although we can not expect a remarkable acting game, it was ridiculously bad and, honestly, offered all the entertainment that needed to be had. This is the positive side of the film. Writing, lighting and editing are elements that really entertain the film. <br /> <br /> This film provides much too much. moments. There are many moments, such as the fact that the mother has strange crises at dinner and that this has absolutely no consequences in the film. Throughout the dinner, a manager decided it was fun to watch people eat fine food for five minutes in a row, without dialogue, whenever a meal was served. During meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene is completely dark outside. Then, coming home. And when it comes to the darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the film is the weather, where it does not seem to be dark, unless it's raining. And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the film is that it is so poorly lit that you can not see what's happening half the time, which is more frustrating than anything else. In one of the climatic scenes, you can not even tell what you are supposed to see being so shocking. <br /> <br /> And in terms of climatic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say, "Wow, that surprised me, and that's good." I can say that the great revelation surprised me, because I did not see it coming. The reason I did not see it coming is because it made no sense. I will not spoil this for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes going up in different parts of the film to find anything that could have validated that, and all we found was more speaking. that it was not possible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is better if you watch it with the tracks of comments that are fun. I love shit horror movies, but it was too much.
