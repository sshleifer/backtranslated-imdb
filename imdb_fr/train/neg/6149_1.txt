I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before leaving his work entirely. Having unfortunately treated Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught in so many traits of Lucas. How else do you explain its ravages? His only useful movie, of course, was Willow. Everything else, including this one, depends too much on superficial junk food. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even have a semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard is so stuck in his qualities of Spielbergian imitation that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "Love overcomes everything, even disease." Too bad for Howard Lynch has already understood all the subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than that. Ron does not even care about the possibilities offered by imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's comment is horrible. Do not even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Dud Cinematic
