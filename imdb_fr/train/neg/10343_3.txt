The golden age of Disney cartoons was dying in the late 90s. This Quack Pack show should not even be considered a spin-off of DuckTales because the show had almost nothing to see with DuckTales. This is a teenager, Huey, Dewey and Louie, who cause problems to their uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop jargon. I prefer the adventurous little nephews of DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There is no reference to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want a lot of burlesque humor, I recommend it. If you want a better Disney show, check out "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
