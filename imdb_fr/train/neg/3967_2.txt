DARK REMAINS is a low-budget American horror film that has won two awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to have two distinct parts. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists during the bath. Second, the girl of a technical writer is found the throat sliced. The mourning couple decides to settle in an isolated cabin in the mountains. It appears later that the cabin and the surrounding places are haunted. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the two parts of the story finally come together as one would reasonably expect. However, the execution is random and creates a confusion that could only be solved by multiple visualizations. Unfortunately, the film is simply not attractive enough to attract most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost anything that could go wrong with this movie goes bad - and fast! And the low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production because the material was just too poor. <Br /> <br /> The characters are irrelevant, as other commentators have pointed out on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them an interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for situations of character and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The direction is not inspired. The inspiration for J-Horror's films such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is obvious. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay much attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on the fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant changes between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example) and the reaction of a central character who faces it without any warning. There is no element of humor or language in the cheek in these films. Everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can not help but be convinced and captivated by it. The threatening atmospheres create suspense and ensure that the horror has a psychological impact, very different from the "jump frights" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The directors of DARK REMAINS courageously try to avoid the Hollywood clichés also successfully avoided the use of CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intentioned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed "fear" on the screen. The makeup effects of "ghosts" were not too serious considering the low budget but their actions defied logic. I scratched my head several times during this film. <br /> <br /> I could not give the end even if I wanted it. I just could not understand. All I could infer was that it was a little anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What's left? The answer, as a critic on a different website, stressed is boredom. The film is a chore to go through. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most of them would probably die well before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things I could find in this film: the successful avoidance of alarmist clichés and the absence of the word-word in each sentence as one would expect normally to find. That's what the 2 stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who love the supernatural or psychological horror of ghosts and haunting would do well to stick to such films as THE HELL HOUSE LEGEND, THE CHANGELING or the J- Subtitle kind of horror. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure horror movie "R-rated" about ghosts, check out the movie DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the biggest horror film ever made, but it is surely better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK REST like the plague.
