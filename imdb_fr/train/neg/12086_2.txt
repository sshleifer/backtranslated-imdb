... This verse does not distort the bard so badly. It is always a horrible minimalist production, the Dutch uncle of Hamlet is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard (whether it is a subject to debate or not, Ricardo Montalban), and Maximilian Schell shows unprecedented bidding. Most of the dialogues are unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version seems to have to remind many times that speeches are long * duh * does not seem incredibly funny to me. Mostly it's just a bad acting game, though.
