This song does not stop buzzing in my head. Not the best song, but it's the 80s. This movie is about a senior singer who is "supposed" to be killed when he was accused of murder while he was watching his girlfriend who sings relief voices in his group. The lead vocalist Billy "Eye" (yeah, right) died after two years and his band returns for a concert. Only the vocalist is the main singer this time. Billy pursues her and ends up killing all those people, terrifying the girl and making everyone around her think that there is something wrong with her and that she has to imagine things. She finally decides to go to a cemetery and dig her grave to see if he is still there. She sees that he is dead but continues to see and hear his voice. At the end of the film, we discover the reason behind all this. Billy has a brother named John (again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he had killed all those people to join him and blame him on his brother and then take his little friend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The end is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden. But .... I like it anyway. I'm looking for the song. I would like to have it.
