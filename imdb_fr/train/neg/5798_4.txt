This film is a strange mix of music, romance, drama and crime accompanied by a film noir. It's basically a bunch of different genres, none of which really work out as expected. <br /> <br /> This film is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is a former child star who has always played in happy comic and musical productions at the beginning of his career. In this film, he takes a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually quite laughable in the film. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is an extremely small man, with a youthful air. In fact, he was already in his thirties when shooting this movie, but he looks seriously like a 16-year-old man. To hear him say to the babies and to hear the gangsters who are about three times bigger than him, do not seem and feel bad. He's just not convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the film mixes so many different genres, the story feels really messy. Somewhere, there is a criminal plot and somewhere in this one is a romantic plot and a story about fulfilling your dream, but none of that really works because of the messy approach and the treatment of everything that. It's just not an interesting or compelling film to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has only shot 10 films in his lifetime, while his career lasted from 1935 to 1957. He is a struggling director who had a hard time finding work in the world. 'industry. while was given a less script to work with. His films are all unknown and are generally not too high quality. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that this is a film of the 50s, but it looks more like a film from the 40s, or even that of the 30s This is good sure mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. The black and white movies of the 50s usually have an inexpensive appearance and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's pretty strange to see Mickey Rooney, Louis Armstrong and his band playing together in a sequence. It was not the only film in which Armstrong looked good and he often appeared in this type of film, often just like himself. I imagine that jazz fans can still enjoy watching this movie because of its music, because there are many in this film. The film actually received an Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> A clumsy little movie and a Mickey Rooney release. <br /> <br /> 4/10
