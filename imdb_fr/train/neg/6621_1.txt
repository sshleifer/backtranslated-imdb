Something somewhere must have gone terribly wrong when the director perceived this plot. The film, which was supposed to be the remake of one of the most beloved films in cinema, fails to offer every aspect of film making. The best artists could not either support the development, which simply shows that the film was in itself a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The editing is mediocre. The direction is shit. The game is out of this world (OMG)! The supposedly scary characters force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I would not watch the movie, even if someone paid me the ticket price or even gave me a free hamburger with it.
