1 How is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices such as universal translators or microbes of translators? Did the creators of this show realize that people from different parts of the world and in different time frames (Attilla the Hun was not a contemporary of pre-made Hellenic cultures, nor the contemporary Vikings of the pyramid builders) speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern English (with the exception of the inflections they "do not use"), which was influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, trust must be won, but wherever the team arrives, it is welcomed without any suspicion and begins to organize people as if they were their leaders. Of course, real fans would say they are perceived as gods. The people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft, etc. <br /> <br /> 3 History: none. It may be vaguely reminiscent of Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can dress in tablecloths or go to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and pretend to have the look of the room. A theater troupe in a small town probably has better props. <br /> <br /> 4 Boring! Another lame production from Canuck, inexplicably exploited for ten long years. As children show, this could make the difference, but anyone with some notions of human behavior and language can not even look at the first twelve episodes of Season 1, as I just did. I really wanted to believe that I had found a decent science fiction show, otherwise I would shut up and clean my computer from this shelter after the first five minutes!
