A sexually obsessed leader leads a life of duplicity: one as a "happy" man married with a child of ten, the other as a demon of sex. Most of the standard film follows him for five consecutive days. Nastassja Kinski, clinical sexologist, tells it in the blink of an eye, listening to her story and examining it intelligently. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only adult protagonist not to undress. If she did, I would have rated this movie as a big "F." In the current state of things, he notes an F +, which implies that it is always a failure, unless one is bored. It is probably more interesting to spend 90 minutes cleaning the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" (Diary of a Sex Addict) is part of the category of movies that once seen, we wish we had not seen it.
