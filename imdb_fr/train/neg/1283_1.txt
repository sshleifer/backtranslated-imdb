I must say that the first time I watched this movie was about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it. I bought the DVD recently and, after a second viewing, I wondered why I liked it. The acting was awful and, as usual, we have stereotyped clans in their fake costumes. The acting game was horrible at best. Tim Roth did an acceptable job, as did Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking about. <br /> <br /> The scenario was good, but the execution was mediocre. I'm tired of seeing Scotland so portrayed in the movies. Braveheart was even worse though, this movie only saves grace. But seriously, people did not speak like that at the time, why should all actors have glasgory accents? Just another film to try to capture the essence of already tired and boring stereotypes. I notice that the only people here to say that this film is good are the Americans. To be honest, I understand why they would like this movie. I know they have a craze for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I would say that you are spending your money for something else, like a better movie.
