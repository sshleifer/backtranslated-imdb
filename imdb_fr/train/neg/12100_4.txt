Now, do not get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of all that is wrong in the history of human civilization and a flawless path to a better future for humanity, where do you go better than a comedian? practitioner of pop culture? If you need a good dose of all the solid and valid reasons why religion has survived its usefulness, call Sagan or Dawkins, and not BILL MAHER, for God's sake! This is a good point in itself. Maher views our religious past as a neurological disorder, conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art, and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies heavily on his clever play of irony and cynicism. to assert one's point of view by trying to appear scholarly and wise. Unfortunately, his intelligence is not up to par. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest light bulb in the box. As an example, it responds to the interviewee's assertion (and I use the term in an approximate way, because they were clearly all "ambus√©es") asserting that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact with a impasse "no, it is not" followed by a long look intended to despise the naivety of the subject (a device that we do not care too much in the film). The problem is that the person was right and that Maher was wrong in saying that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels. I suppose that Mr. Maher never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary just like the fictional works of other giants of the mind, like Michael Moore, and they will brave strong and guffaw (they certainly did during my projection). <br /> <br /> It is however doubly revealing that the strongest and most mule-like clutch occurred for about 70% of the time the film devoted to its anti-Christian tirade film while the audience was completely silent during the 10% symbolic devoted to the criticism of the Religion of Peace described by his care. Hmmm. Either the criticism of Islam is forbidden to the trendy and liberal target audience, or they were simply afraid of laughing. Very speaking, anyway ..
