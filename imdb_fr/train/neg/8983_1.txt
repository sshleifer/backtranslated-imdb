Ulises is a professor of literature who arrives in a coastal city. There, he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will begin a torrid romance that will end with the tragic death of Ulises at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lives quiet and happy, surrounded money. One day, the appearance of Ulises will raise his passion and act without thinking of the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors play a decent role. In addition, three quarters of the film are sexual acts that, being always well filmed, are quite tiring because we want to see more development of the story. It's a bad Bigas Luna movie, with lots of sex, no discussion, and stupid characters everywhere.
