This was shown at the 59th Edinburgh International Film Festival, although for reasons that remain to be left to the powers that be. It looks like it's the first Thai-language film made with actors and a Thai crew, but made by a Westerner. To be honest, I do not need to bother because this film is dull, dull, dull. Why allude to something, why hide a mysterious idea, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point with terrible voice-over, obvious plans and unforgettable scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination as always Spurrier awkwardly produces clich√©s without end. No hint, no riddle, everything is on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder when the "scary" part is coming? No, you will not do it, because the soundtrack will become more and more intimidating, becoming a sinister crescendo. Hell, I make words to describe how bad it is. I wonder if the conjured demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes, it's really biting at the crotch, and blood splatters everywhere. It is a strange and disturbing film for several reasons. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the jerks are signaled and obvious. It may be a scathing attack on the sowing side in Thailand, but the director has a sleazy and lewd style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens. Maybe he was pretending to be a Westerner taking the virginity that sowed doubt in my head. Or maybe everything was just pants. Inspired, tasteless, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for the best description, but dull seems the most appropriate and honest. Everything has been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Congratulations to all counts. Really sorry.
