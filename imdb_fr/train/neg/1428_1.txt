Although this film was shot before Dogme, it has emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital triumphs. You get the point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly foresaw these developments. Corin Nemec is simply remarkable because its author and narrator does not succeed. The pace is slow, but with elegance, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Record it the next time it's on T.V., because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgic scam movie. Direct-to-video has never felt so good!
