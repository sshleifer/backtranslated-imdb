I saw it on the market square at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real economical product - nothing wrong with that, but you have to make up for it with some sex, gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - Well done to the producers for hanging it, I guess. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the falling spaceship is hilarious - you can imagine every hand of the crew shaking it! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people who did it well - at least it's not pretentious.
