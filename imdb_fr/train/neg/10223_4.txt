I remembered the title so much. For me, it was a film by Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in secondary roles. And there was Vincent Massey's voice behind the whiskers. Well, Flora Robson was great. His next signature, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing". The same role but with different sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was everything done in Elizbethan at night? It was talkative and hard to understand, sometimes. I could not say what was the point of love. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not think Elizabeth would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend sending firefighting ships against the Armada. Apparently, it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. It might have been more accurate historically, but Bette Davis had more appealing scripts. And I missed the light of day!
