* Can anyone tell me where is the comedy ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!), and all that is so thick! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a cartoon that turned out to be a bloody nightmare and it was not even funny? Like the scene of the plan in the bathroom; it was so good with his cinematographic imagination but there is nothing else .. except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * It's actually a kind of work they did to win it and make money, but it became such a crime when this money would be stolen from those who have been deceived by such low art works and entertainment that had absolutely no entertainment! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been uglier if it was a big production starring Brando in his movie. golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * The Sheen family is here. Just be aware of that! <br /> <br /> * All those who have found themselves admiring this film or - forbidden God, love it! Then you have to follow a live therapy before becoming more dangerous and hurting someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the film is not! And he did not intend to be part of it here after reading this for sure !! But the big problem is that no one else has ever worked in this field, trying or wanting to be smart or even good !!! (Sorry I'm crying now!) The torture of the movie is amazing! <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hits (Mira Sorvino) by his shoes! It was so realistic !? Maybe he saw herself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such shit! <br /> <br /> * For the billion times: This one could have been better (or less worse!). The scenario, until the robbery of the train, was nice and I imagined that they would escape a chase like this (Smokey and the bandit) but with (Brando) as sheriff. In fact, none of these chimeras were much more lenient than what I saw! <br /> <br /> * Why did this masterpiece receive no Razzie reward ?! You want me to believe that there was a film lower than CE? I do not think so ! This is a situation where the supervisor of the Razzie must himself win one for his negligence !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is also present as a guest, perhaps to support his son who failed, but ironically, the father was as failing as his son! and why ?! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than comic books are not as good as his ambitions! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy movie, NO .. It's a horror movie !, and I hate horror movies, especially those that have been propagated as Hilarious! <br /> <br /> * Name, good thing about it? Hmmm! Well, this one compared to another monster film by Marlon Brando (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: if you still want to know who the bad guys, the ugly ones and the ugly ones are in this movie .. Just pray your last prayers and go watch it. God help you!
