Sorry everyone, "I know it's supposed to be an" art "movie, but wow, they should have given weapons at the screening so people could smash their heads without looking. The stage design and the photographic direction are excellent, this story is too painful to watch.The absence of a sound track was brutal.The loooonnnng shots were too long.How long can you watch two people sitting and talking? the dialogue is that two people are complaining, I really struggled to get through this movie, the performances were excellent, but how many dark, dark, uninspired things can you take? it's Maureen Stapleton, her red dress and her dance scene, otherwise it was a Bergman scam, and I'm not a fan of her either, I think anyone who says they enjoyed an hour and a half of this is lying.
