When I saw the preview, I thought: it'll be a good movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the shooting is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow over the entire picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, which took away all the magic of the film. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the English subtitles were more refined and more appropriate than those of French origin, which probably explains the good note that the film received on the imbd!
