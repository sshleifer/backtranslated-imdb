If I write a review on a film, it may be true to me ... but in general, I would expect to forget that I have seen this one in just two weeks. So why bother? Because again, I find myself watching a bad quality movie, fun to watch. I did not expect that I would be able to stay in the room while she was on. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of mistakes that always makes me cringe. It was just sweetness ... and if you can not stand it, stay in the locker room, guys. I agree with those who defend this film because it will surely appeal to its target audience and will not please an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good laughs, here and there, but that's it. a lateral separator. Of course, it's ridiculous and not very entertaining, but at least it's not afraid (as many have said). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive side? <br /> <br /> I tend to notice on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or a 6 is actually a good overall ranking in my book. Giving a 4 makes sense and will reinforce its note at the time of writing. Giving a 1 or a 10, as most have done so far, makes the scoring numbers meaningless. I can not believe how much people feel this feeling one way or another about this forgettable fluff (or even worry about writing about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Emma Roberts plays her role of Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, often written in first-rate roles, does not disappoint when his character owes him his due. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, although his role is incidental. <br /> <br /> You can surely miss it if you are an adult. But, if there is a pre-teenager in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared not to hate it (you might even like it).
