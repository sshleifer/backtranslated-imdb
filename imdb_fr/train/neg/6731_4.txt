Unlike another reviewer, I think it's well written, especially if it's more fictional, because it would take more imagination; and played well, because there were no other characters to share the center of these monologues a dozen minutes and more, well done. But I'm just not amused by such solemn and pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten stories and problems, not very unusual, that illustrate how the life of everyone (or a part of it) is a food for the film. Once again, I do not think so much about reality shows. So, if it's your bag, you might like this. These are the kinds of things that would make good gossip on the phone and / or the Internet; but absolutely without any action other than verbal. And, although each of the speakers is a woman, I will leave the genre apart from that.
