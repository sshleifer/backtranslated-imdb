I just read a review defending this film because it had a small budget and I was therefore considering. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were pretty well animated, but were implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes were not even fights, it was just a shot of an actor then a monster hit with a lot of interaction. When the monster interacted, it looked like it was done in Painttshop Pro. In my opinion, if you have a small budget, you should use models and puppets. They may not seem fancy but at least they interact, just watch Peter Jacksons' first movies. <br /> <br /> As for Beowulf's role, he did a descent job but the rest of the cast did not try or forgot where they were. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confused. One minute, they would speak as if it were the modern era, and the speech of the Shakespeare theater club. I'm not saying it should be all the time, but you have to find a coherent balance so that the lines sound as if they come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed a close part of the beginning when Beowulf quoted the old testament that would have been found if he had not spent the rest of the movies talking about gods and omens. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a very slightly polite movie, but a trick anyway.
