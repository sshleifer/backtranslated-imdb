LL Cool J performed much better in this film than I expected! He did a fabulous job as a renegade policeman in a renegade department. From the beginning, he does an excellent job of developing the spectator's empathy with his character and the difficult situation in which he finds himself. in the right place from the beginning - and it does an amazing job. He was clearly the best character in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was definitely a performance that will not win any prize at Morgan Freeman. After playing in films such as Shawshank Redemption, this film was certainly a step forward. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true acting skills - and with regard to the agglomeration of characters, he unfortunately put it on the back burner. His character (Moses Ashford) could have played a more decisive role in many ways. The fact that he did not do it was disappointing and really disappointing. I was hoping to see more in this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should have stayed in the music industry. His portrait of a young journalist was misinterpreted and unconvincing. This film is a typical action movie that looks (at least initially) to the corrupt police affairs that LA has known in the past. As an action film, it has its share of shooting scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are usually unrealistic and painfully predictable. Looking at the beginning of the film, there is very little suspense about what will happen in the end - think about what you normally expect in a conflict between good and bad cops - and it does not look like a real film shoot policeman -out. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me the most is how the character of Timberlake behaved during the shooting scenes. He starts with firearms and does not use them. Then, when he finally uses one, he pulls him as if he had used a gun all his life. Then he runs out of bullets and does not have a rifle - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything - suddenly has 2 more loaded pistols AND ammunition in excess ?! Small plot errors like this really messed up the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a completely fictitious scenario in a fantasy world where everything is going well, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, the type of film I want does not matter as long as it's realistic. Let me believe that the story is true. This story was so fictitious in many ways that I left feeling dissatisfied.
