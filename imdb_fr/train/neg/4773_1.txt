a very good scenario, a good thrill ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole film ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last few seconds ... sorry to say but a 1 in the vote ... that's what it deserves, I would think Chris Shadley could come up with a better ending ... but can -being next time :) all that blood meaningless gore for nothing? the end would take the story to almost 10, but it did not ... the end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not lame and when they go a movie, they want a good ending, even if it's complex ... but the only lame here is the end ... sorry
