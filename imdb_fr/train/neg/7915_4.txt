All X-Men movies were great. And I'm talking about them all, including X-Men 3, who has long been hated. They had strong characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good story. <br /> <br /> I was excited when I heard that this movie was in production, and my expectations grew until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is The Fountain, although you do not hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his game of actor is not what makes the movie up. <br /> <br /> The whole film is filled with insignificant characters who add nothing to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), which were thrown on the spot to make fans believe that the directors had Read the comics original. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of XMen, I read a lot, a lot of their stories and this movie does not respect any. No. Not even continuity. This does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, but the motives of the wolverine are completely stupid and end up in millions of movies: The revenge of the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I expected from this whole film was a berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 at school when Stryker's men come in and he decimates enemy forces alone, but hey, that's Fox, this family film and you will not see the explicit violence of the most violent and macabre hero of Marvel. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had a constant feeling of déjà vu with this film because the Origins of Wolverine are already explained in X2, we already know his skeleton in adamantium, so he has no sense of make a movie with something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Wolverine is one of those rare characters that does not need a solid story. because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?
