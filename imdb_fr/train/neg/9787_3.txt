... but the problem of this production is that it is very far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Of course, we can not always expect spiritual masters like Sondheim, Bernstein or Porter; however, the music in this piece gives Andrew Lloyd Webber a witty air. It's deadly dull and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and just after looking at it, I did not remember a single important tune - which is rather tragic from someone who has taught another hundred people from three plays. <br /> <br /> He's also strangely non-theatrical. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (you really have to be sorry for people who have broken the neck in the front row to see something happen 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and do absolutely nothing with that. When there is someone supposed to sing on stage, that's exactly what you get - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me, as a future theater director, it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture in his works better than those non-talents can ever come closer. And I'm puzzled by the popularity of this supposedly legendary musical.
