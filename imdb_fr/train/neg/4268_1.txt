I remembered this spectacle of my childhood. I did not remember too much, just a few things about the characters. for some reason, I remembered that it was really intense. so it was really early in the morning in Pennsylvania. After having watched the Web for a long time, I finally found an episode. the first episode no-less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. it was obviously done to show the children to play tag lazer and have a good time. the show starts with bhodi li saying to his mom "my names are not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we are then forced to watch children play lazer tag with the song "loose foot". and not just a little fast, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts me just thinking about it. oh yes, and as if I could not get worse, you could not even see the laser beams of their guns. it's like they're running around the song "loose foot". Later, after bhodi has climbed into space or wherever they are, they will compete for a laser pistol fight with Phil Collins' su-su-sudio. ah, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... the light is shining !!!!!!!!!!!
