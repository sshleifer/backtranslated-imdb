I have two very important complaints about this film. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental store has set aside what is clearly a soft core porn in the "suspense" category. (If I had known what it was, I would not have lost my time renting it, and yes, this movie is a soft core porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title n ' has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie does anything that is deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of both. <br /> <br /> In fact, make three major complaints: <br /> 3. That, for some reason, I watched the movie long enough to discover the number two point of this list. Boy, I regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film is worthless at virtually every level.
