I would have liked to tape MEN IN WHITE to be able to watch it again <br /> <br /> "What do you mean you really liked Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean I could look at him again to see if he was as retarded, stupid and as embarrassing as I can remember <br /> <br /> Many people claimed that it was designed for children. May I suggest that it was also done by children? because the entire structure of the script lacks any kind of discipline on the part of producers and screenwriters and that many pieces of scenery seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> > does not help me but I really started to feel sorry for them. Honestly, you might think that during the shoot, the actors had to lie to their families filming a hard porn movie like their embarrassment of having to appear in something as lamentable as this one. To give you an idea of ​​the seriousness of the act, whenever BAYWATCH's daughter, Donna D'Ericco, disappeared from the story, I waited patiently for her to reappear, then, a few seconds later, I forgot that she was in the movie. Got that? A BAYWATCH star appears and a few seconds later you forget that she is in the movie. That tells you all you need to know about the level of MEN IN WHITE <br /> <br /> Pretty good, it's enough to try to be a cartoon in action similar to THE GOODIES (Even though THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this film), although the film may deserve credit for never descending to toilet humor, but since it is a children's movie (this is not did not stop ITV from broadcasting it at 11pm), so there should not be almost crazy humor.
