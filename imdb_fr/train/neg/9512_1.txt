I can not believe it, it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because of his stupidity) If someone paid me to see this movie again, I would not do it. the plot was so horrible, it made no sense, and the acting was so bad that I could not even tell if they were trying. this movie was terrible rating: F
