Let me start by saying that this film has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: Me again George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the role? George: New George is just lucky, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was always fun ... But again, I'm easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I would not say it's the worst movie I've ever had never seen (this title goes terribly funny disaster ...), this film falls No. 7 on my list of the last 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who is entertained easily, you enjoy this movie. If you are a movie lover and want a good funny movie, you will end up shooting yourself in the middle of it.
