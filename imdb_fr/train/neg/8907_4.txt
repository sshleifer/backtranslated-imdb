I rented this DVD yesterday and I did not know it was a "character study" movie. I had a hard time looking at it for about an hour before pressing the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a character-themed study, I just could not get into this movie. It may have been my mood to want to look at something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting that aside, I did my best to get to the end of watching, but I dropped. The actors played their role well, but the overall combination did not meet to keep my interest. The sergeant's pistol had been stolen and he hastened to buy another one. The spray paint painted him black to make it look like a police affair. I think this film should have been titled "Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?" The scenes were well done, but by assembling them, I once again felt stripped of everything that was consistent so that I could continue to watch. <br /> <br /> Since I have not finished looking at it, I would say that the rental of this film has some merit. .. perhaps. For me it was a waste of visualization time and effort. I'll let you try it, but I would not recommend it highly.
