This is a sequel to "A Christmas Story", originally titled "A Summer Story". Ralphie recounts his family adventures in the summer when he moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately, there is no hilarity. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its irreverence and honesty - everyone could understand it. This one is just stupid and not very funny at all. The latest film by Charles Grodin - no wonder! This is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is worded, and you have to wonder why they even bothered. <br /> <br /> a competition with spinning tops ?! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
