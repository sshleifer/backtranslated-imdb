Phew. What can we say about Gymkata who has not already done so? It's nothing but pure halarity from start to finish. If you want a film that will make you laugh on the ground, this is the ideal movie. From Cabot's wild mules / pullovers combo to Parmistan (and its four billion matching ninjas), everything about this movie smells like shit. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Clouse, the famous spirit that brought you the scene of the mirror In Game of Death by Bruce Lee, he once again demonstrates his total lack of talent as a director. Some faces that you probably will not recognize will also appear to your delight, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, even if you will not remember or worry about it after the movie ends. <br /> <br /> supposedly based on a book called "The Terrible Game", which, if I could find a trace of its existence anywhere, I would be interested to read it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book is apparently a product of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something that Clouse invented to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and Yakmallah for yourself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot.
