Obviously, made to show the "acting" talents of Misty Ayers, a stripper of the 1950s. Too bad she can not act. <br /> <br /> Boring story about the sweet and innocent Sally Down (Ayers) drugged and forced to white slavery (prostitution). She then meets the friendly Tommy Cole who instantly falls in love with her. He wants to help him escape but can he? You will not really care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers slowly undresses to her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story, full of bad comedy, dreadful "comedy" (never thought that prostitution was funny but what do I know?) And terrible post-dubbed dialogues. I admit that there was a twist in the end that I did not see coming but it's not enough to get through that. In addition, Ayers's attempts are hysterical! A real bomb. To avoid.
