This film is supposed to be a serious and mysterious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, after 30 minutes of film, the film turns into a fun and unrealistic story with boring characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone who does not laugh when Cage randomly chooses karate karate or when he "punches" this old lady with fists. The lines, characters and actors are poorly made from the start. I have always loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made some terrific films this year; this being by far the worst (so far ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a captivating thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend to watch it, get ready to laugh at certain lines and finish scenes rather than take them seriously; this is the only way you enjoy this movie.
