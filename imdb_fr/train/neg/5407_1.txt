If you want to watch a real "quality" movie, download The Eden Formula. This wonderful movie had to cost $ 50 in production. It has a very thin script, pathetically bad scenery, lights and camera work, and a very laughable paper mache monster (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and / or a puppet glove for the monster - but all were equally terrible). <br /> <br /> The actors all speak as if they had never seen them before and read a prompter. The special effects go well beyond ugly. And the only sad thing is that they abandoned the original title "Tyranasaurus Wrecks", very nice, which summarizes exactly what you get for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard that you pierce the crud below. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute.
