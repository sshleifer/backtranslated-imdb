This film represents the times when it was done as much as the original, I suppose. Which is really sad, because on a deeper level, the title "vanishing point" of the original is so ironic. I'm sure it was not what it was intended, but the original was shot in 1970 and released in 1971. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' marked the end of an era that virtually ended at in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements were removed and converted more to PC in order to reach a wider audience, presumably. "Sanitized For Your Protection" <br /> <br /> The inclusion of Native American scenes was free, and the idea of ​​a "noble goal" of the trip was to subtract by addition. I'm glad I watched it though, it made me appreciate the original even more. The original is a cult classic and gilded. This remake is awful.
