In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was kidnapped by parodies like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentin fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that was done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher movie that has almost nothing to gore. The plot is so much like Halloween and Urban Legend that it's not funny. And by the time the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooooo predictable. The kind of teen slasher is DEAD Get it it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
