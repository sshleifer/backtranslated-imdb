Recently, I watched Belle Epoque, thinking that it could be wonderful because he won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. I was a little disappointed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Maybe the conflict I had was that since filming the movie until now, the plot of a man who falls in love with beautiful women and who ends up falling for the good girl has already been made to many times. In addition to the predictability of the plot, some scenes from the movie seemed really irrelevant to the storyline (for example, some event at the wedding). Sometimes, the film was a little preached in his ideas and in relation to the Franco period, the film unfolded and in the church. The only thing the film was meant for was the cute moments, the landscape and the character of Violeta being a strong and independent woman at a time when women were not really associated with these characteristics.
