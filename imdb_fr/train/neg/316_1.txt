This film is by far the worst film ever made. If you have to make a film about the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights, do not do that damn movie. I must say that I could watch Leprechaun in space 6 times before I can watch the trailer of this movie. Adam Sandler should be excluded from any movie after this shame. Watching this movie is like listening to Cher and putting his dick in a blender. Anyone who has half of a brain will realize that this movie is not worth it. If I had one more dollar and I had to spend it, I would give it to the Lorraina Bobbitt Foundation, which supports the project, before buying this film.
