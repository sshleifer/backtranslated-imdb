A slasher movie, made in the early 80's, carries a curse that puts someone trying to finish him dead. Years later, a group of film students tried to finish the film - also resurrecting the film's deadly curse. Great movie idea but, unfortunately, "Cut" is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best horror record in the world. 'Razorback' (1984) was a frenzy just like 'Holwing III' (1987), which was still a half-American film. For our foray into comic horror, "Body Melt" (1993) is best left behind. The problem with "Cut" is that manufacturers who try to create an intelligent horror satire at "Scream" (1996) have no idea what kind or what makes it work. And while it sounds weird, I say that about a slasher movie, but what's really missing at "Cut" is "heart". Of course, he follows the basic "rules" established by "Scream", but he does not want to play with the formula, but rather for a hard copy of the previous one. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and less charismatic villains in the history of horror film. His awkward endless dam, lame doublings would make the dialogue of a porn look like Shakespeare. The actors never seem totally involved and just wait for the end of the shooting to be able to recover their paychecks. And the sensation of the film is like deliberately trying not to be scary; more like an episode of 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High'. Incidentally, these MTV-style, hyper-cinema attempts in the "research" sequence seemed lame, out of date, and out of place. <br /> <br /> hope we'll do it again) maybe we should take a sheet from the 'Mad Max' book (1979). Instead of trying to copy the United States, we should try our own interpretation of the genre.
