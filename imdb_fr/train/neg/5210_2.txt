First let me be honest. I did not watch this whole movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized that I had almost fallen asleep, I decided that I could move forward quickly and see if it became more interesting later ... It was not not the case. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to turn an already uninteresting and badly told story into something it would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I think it's important to say that even a film with poor special effects can still be good if it's done right. This movie is not and will only put you in deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I think it's important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain, so if you think you should watch it, a little research on the Internet will surely show you a place where you will not have need to pay to watch it. piles of cinematographic feces.
