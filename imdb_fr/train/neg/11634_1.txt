I saw this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival in the presence of the great Dr. Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The movie is just very, very bad. And no, not in the usual way of Uwe Boll "so bad that it's actually entertaining", but just plain bad. The plot is about a man who lives a terrible life (apparently because of his criminal record), who can not find work and with a terrible woman who cheats 900 pounds. This man turns to his uncle, the leader of the sect, to steal a toy truck containing the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda is also planning to steal the toys. What follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful (except for Dave Foley, who tries really hard though), the jokes never go above the kids who get shot in the chest in slow motion and It's supposed to be a satire, but I do not know what. <br /> <br /> Think "Airplane!", but it's done by the creators of South Park, and no jokes.
