The story goes like this, Netflix was late and sent me my DVDs. So I went to the analog rental service known as "Blockbuster Video". They are void, you know. Really bad, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your enjoyment but I never want to see any. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all alone. I like to see movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see this stuff. Anyway, I put this DVD and all of a sudden, from the first second, it is zero. I'm sitting there with my boyfriend and we're like, "What's that kind of shit?" Unstable camera operation, horrible actor play, the first scene in which a woman is killed wondering if she would prefer to calm down calmly instead, then a rat will get stuck in her throat. I really wonder if the administrator has a tough guy. This "film" is not decent. All I have to say to the director is "do you have a tripod?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was awful. It was as if they had just decided one day to make a film. They were probably gathering people from Walmart to introduce themselves and "act" for them. Simply horrible. If you're making a film like this, making it your hobby - NOT what you should do for a living - SHOULD NOT go to DVD stores for moviegoers like me. It's better to leave it at home for your friends when you have a party and you miss out on interesting things to entertain them with .... Then you take out your movie from BTK Kller and you say, "You want to see this shitty movie what have I done? "
