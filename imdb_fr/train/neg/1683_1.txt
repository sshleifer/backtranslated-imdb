It's hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made me jump slightly in surprise at a few moments. <br /> <br /> If we forget the scary dimension and look at the other aspects of the film, he is disappointed again. The acting is ok but not great. The story may be somewhat interesting at first, while one tries to understand what is happening. But towards the end, we understand that there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements sometimes seem to have been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) Look at this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
