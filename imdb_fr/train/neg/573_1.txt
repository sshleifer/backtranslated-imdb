The last review was very generous. I'm silent like the first movie, but I can not say I appreciate this one a lot. The beginning is bearable, but the descent is fast. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many scenes simply do not make sense. I mean that any normal person would suspect something serious when a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why Una is able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was ever explained in this film, it would not bother you if it was entertaining, but it was too much to ask. It must be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
