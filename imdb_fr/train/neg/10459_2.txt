Disconnected, unclear, bad scenario, bad photography and direction ... In short, it is clearly a first effort poorly designed for the production of commercial films by the good people of TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has had success in the past by helping to present "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, on the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate misfortune. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs and loves "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do a lot of good with their department, but it's not an example. Do not waste your money ... rent "China Cry" instead.
