DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is a comedy as deceptive and desperate as it is to stay at home the couch looking at a Chris Rock number on television looks like a paradise. Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait". It was a good movie, and it's good to show how a group of aspiring writers can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost all targets. From concept to narration, "Down to Earth" fails miserably; It's incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a mediocre stage comedian, both in his role in this movie and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager (Frankie Faison) is even sorry for him when he is booed off the stage during an amateur evening at the local theater. Shortly after the screenplay established his lack of talent, the character is killed by a truck that runs at full speed. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made a mistake, taking Lance before his number was up. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance catch up with the rest of his time on Earth, provided he takes the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> the name of the old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann), who steals his money. But that's because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, fell in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, Lance trying to get a better body and Sontee's confused feelings with a hospitable situation involving Mr. Wellington's finances. <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has good ideas, but it is a useless and unconvincing love story filled with instruments and recycled materials. The most important problem we face is our perception of Lance by Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he will not be missing most of this film; all the characters see in the new Lance the name of Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It's convenient for the love story. we think a young woman would fall for Lance, but in reality, it's actually an old gray-haired geezer. It's not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The comical situation of a joke is supposed to watch an old man do some fun things that are really done by a black young man. But what inspires laughter is when characters find themselves in conflict without their knowledge. Just look at "There is something about Mary". In amusing scenes, the characters are exposed to difficult experiences, not at will. Here, Lance knows he is in the body of an old man and does things that old people would not do normally. If Lance did not know the body he was in, it might have potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem related to the concept: we have never known Mr. Wellington, so how can we compare Lance in his body when we do not know what he looked like originally. To top it off, Chris Rock must be the center of attention here, and makes the character too much like Rock. He recites simple jokes, tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and simple. I hated the sense of humor of the movie. There are so many insignificant jokes and horrible comical situations. It's like watching Chris Rock as Chris Rock, not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Note the positive aspects of "Down to Earth". Mark Addy is no worse here than in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well melted, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. These are all qualities that I can mention at the moment, and if you give me another week to remember, it is unlikely that I will present more.
