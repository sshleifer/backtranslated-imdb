This film is nil. Something about a heat wave in a European country, full trash. There is nothing happening for this movie. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying girl who catches people and who pisses me off. This film is a complete rash and you should not submit to watch it. I regret it, it's very boring. I would give zero but I can not. No sensible body should see it. I am sure you will regret it completely. How could they imagine something so serious? Even the mysterious men were better. Mysterious Men. That sucks. This film was not worth doing. complete loss of time. The characters are very difficult to understand and I'm bored very well.
