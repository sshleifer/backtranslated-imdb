This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not in all conscience allow this film not to be viewed by me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I like Black Jack, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and boring, the situations are artificial, the unfolding of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unfriendly and uninteresting, and the story, though based on good premises, is stupid. This film is a piece of poo. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt the money wasted on this movie, it is not even worth your time spent watching it. Please do not see it ... I beg you!
