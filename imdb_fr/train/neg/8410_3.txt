This film is all flash and no soul. The actors have put a lot of passion into the numbers, but often these figures are not related to the film and give the impression of being independent video clips. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound like they were happening right in front of you, each sounding as if it was coming from a studio, basically sucking up songs for life. Outside of the stage, the performances were all sad and unrealized, especially Hudson, who plays essentially the same black, angry, "strong" (stubborn and selfish) woman we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth in her character, nor any of the other women leaders. Although I think that the film wants us to believe that the character of Hudson is facing difficulties because of his weight, it is really his own refusal to do what is best for the team that him gets you into trouble, making the end of the movie meaningless. Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she highlighted the emotion (although she was often misplaced, but it was the writer / director's fault), but she did nothing to flesh out a character already subscribed. The character of Eddie Murphy is the only one to have a bow, and he did a good job, but not yet worthy of the Oscars. The only actor who really brought anything to the board was Danny Glover, who took a relatively small little character and did something real. There is nothing here that is boring, no drama, no heart, no laughing. The position of the music numbers was so bad that sometimes the film almost seemed to make fun of musicals instead of being one; When Hudson argues with the other girls, the number of votes is so long that it could have been a Family Guy sketch. The film has no idea what it is, and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. It's a huge and boring waste of time, and it's really the worst film I've seen in 2006, and nothing from last year was really stellar to start with.
