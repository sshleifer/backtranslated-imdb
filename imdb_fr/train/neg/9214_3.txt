Many things become clear when you watch this movie: 1) The acting game is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are pretty much everything, but the conflict between parents and children is on the border of a soap opera. The other two boys: a child prodigy sulky and your stereotype I'm a baby but I'm really sensitive inside the blonde boat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (interpreted by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the first ballads of love is a strange choice ("we are all privileged friends"); 5) Strange lines and side intrigues are not improved by dramatic play; and 5) it's a very bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
