As a former submariner, it was one of the worst underwater films I have ever seen. First, a mutiny aboard any US Navy vessel, particularly a nuclear-powered Trident submarine, is unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they take is great and they take it very seriously, from the captain to the junior crew member. I could never see a crew of a ship parting with her alliance between the captain and the executive officer. An executive officer who played the role of the character embodied by Denzel Washington would be removed from office and court martial, then drummed in the navy. It is not surprising that the navy refused to send a technical advisor to help him make this film. Finally, if a member of the crew of a submarine made the noise caused by this ship, he would be severely reprimanded. Submarines learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam doors and do not even speak softly and wear soft soled shoes during the ride. I was amazed at how much they represented the team during the trip. Strong music would never be tolerated. I know that depicting underwater life would not actually sell movie tickets, but it's ridiculous to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
