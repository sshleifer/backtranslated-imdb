I will be as brief as possible because this shit is worth a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies of all time - with the other horrible film of Schnaas: ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so null that all those who participate in their creation must be shot. I managed (just ...) to sit in front of ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even compared to Schnaas' other horrible film - that I had to make a quick lead after the First 10 minutes. ZERO, no gore, horrible camcorder work, ridiculous dubbing ... it goes on and on. I really can not find one thing that buys about this trash - and I can usually find something that buys in just about any movie. It's really one of the worst movies ever made - you've been warned ... 1/10
