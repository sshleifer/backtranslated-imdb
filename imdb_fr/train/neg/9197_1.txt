You know that some movies will be bad from the first picture. Even if you were totally unaware of Ed Wood's work, take a look at this commentator of "Plan 9 of Space" and know that you are not going to see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls' masterpiece, "House of Dead", with this guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction trying desperately to ring as if he had just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm going for a hellish ride. <br /> <br /> The film starts like this: the main character says first that everyone will die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he begins to present the rest of the characters with lines such as "Karma ... think she is Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..my ex .. we broke up recently .. I had to study and she had to close". No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this group of 20 who could not get out of a wet paper bag goes to "Rave of the century", Rave It is about a few tents, a port-a-pot and a poor-quality scene on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but luckily she will find a way to get there, like a Kirk-owned fishing boat (Cpt Kirk - understand it - the one who wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick, a child bastard from McAllister of the Simpsons and this murderer who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> For short, the gang goes to the island and finds no one there except for a few t-shirts and then decides to flee hell. No wait, they are not happy, they are really happy and like free drinks. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the film falls to the bottom and, against all odds, continues to descend lower. Some guys in rubber suits start running, there's shouting and gunshots, our gang goes to a house to meet another gang, they come out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and a policewoman (who between them weigh about 500 pounds of weapons) then decides to go home. Somewhere along the line, they turn into S.W.A.T. The team, get into the matrix, the guys in the rubber jumps start to multiply like bacteria and I start crying because I paid to see that. To add an insult to injury, every few minutes there are hits from the video game on which this shit is based and there is a nice cinematic scene for some characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. This is not even part of the famous category "Too bad, it's good". It's just bad. The scenario is bad, the zombies are awful, there are no lines of tension, the actors are bad, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation for being awful. Do not There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
