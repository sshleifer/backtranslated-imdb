this movie was just silly, I did not think it was scary at all. I was hoping to be shocked and scared, but I mostly laughed some of the scenes were just to simulate and threw together blood scenes were extremely over and some of the mutants they were ridiculously gay, it was also feared because the acting was all just horrible. We think they could have good actors and most of the characters I hated just because they were stupid and lame even though they were supposed to be in the military watching movies for free and saw a lot of people out im guessing because he was so stupid a little happy I did not have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS FILM do not see it ... but here again it's my opinion
