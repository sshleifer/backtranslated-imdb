I went to expect the movie to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but making fun of the absurdity in the singles rooms was also fun. <br /> <br /> That said, there were a lot of things about The Singles Ward that were completely boring. The whole movie was badly dubbed and made to look at the mouths while listening to their very irritating voices. This lack of professionalism has been surpassed only by Mormon celebrity cameos that have no commercial activity. <br /> <br /> This film will appeal to Mormondom, especially in communities where singles live. However, this conclusion will offer no hope to the poor losers who find themselves single. (Only the pretty girls in the singles room get married, the big and ugly ones are not, but all the ugly men are married) In the end, we realize that the whole movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
