I saw this film during a preliminary screening at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. If I remember correctly, the producers and the director of the film were present, probably to judge our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes evoked laughter from the audience, which would have been nice if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not afraid, it would seem that the filmmakers were. They delayed their release for more than a year. Out of curiosity, I saw him again to see if they had cut him; as far as I know, they did not do it. It was the same ugly movie, barely over a year old. <br /> <br /> It's almost called "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
