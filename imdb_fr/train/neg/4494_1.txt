*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From now on, all the film collapses on itself. We first meet a program for thugs with the indication that we are going to have ghosts, vampires, werewolves, etc. We have a guy with a delayed accent who talks about endless garbage, two "ghosts" that are useless and have no character, and a group of henchmen. Someone told me they were vampires (straight out of Blade 2), but they are so indefinite that I did not realize it. <br /> <br /> The funny accent accentuated with the ridiculous name suffers from the same problem as the Oracle, that for much longer and much worse. He has a simple point about the cause and effect, does it, then continues to do it and does it until it becomes complicated and stupid. His last line before leaving is comparable to the line "Do you know what happens to a toad ..." at X-men to levels of total and bland nastiness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy and pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci because the woman does nothing but what we expect when we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we will have another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is, supposedly, the One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what is it for? Kung Bloody Fu all the time. And although he can stop 1000 balls, he is cut by a sword and still a meal of 5 indecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see amazing powers. I wanted to see him do the craziest, the craziest, the craziest of people, because he can do anything. I ended up as before without the "wow". <br /> <br /> The legendary car chase. It can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's just not what we were told. ALL the great pictures of this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So all that is possibly Wow has been removed, so all we have now is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight !!! Okay, it's not Neo, but you would have thought he would have explained to his closest friends the reality of Matrix. At least taught them something. It's not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's happening to you in the matrix, it's not real, as long as you understand that nothing is real, nothing can really to harm you. " <br /> <br /> And there you are. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad. It's never boring and it does not seem to be 16 minutes. It's so disappointing. And yet the situation is getting worse. <br /> <br /> The final climax of the movie is probably the worst you can imagine. They have this elaborate plan that involves three crews. They only show it sporadically between Morpheus' long and super-praised monologue. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what this plan involves which requires 3 teams. You know roughly, but you do not know who's doing what, when, so when a crew falls, you do not care, and you do not know how that will affect what's going on. <br /> <br /> I will summarize however, this happens so that Trinity can return to the matrix to configure the end. That's the only reason this happens. Which raises the question, why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity arrives five minutes later! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the matrix (so to speak) is treated sparingly. Ooohhh !!! He still meets 100 Smiths agents !!! Woooooo !!! It must have taken a lot of thought. Only now are they in a hallway, so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment. Man, what a grand finale !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Do you remember everything I said that was bad for the Oracle and the stranger? Add them and double them, that's how much the architect is really dismayed. The only reasonable potential of him is that he is about to establish the sawtooth climax. <br /> <br /> And then he explodes! <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the options he offers to Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies !!! To consider that the choice is something that this film tries to explore does not really give this one a hero. If he had the choice between saving humanity and the missus dying or saving the missus and killing humanity, there is a potential for inner turmoil and tension. Plus, with Trinity being in mid-fall, the potential for a real cliffhanger that would have made it more important to see the third. But no. He saved no one or saved the missus. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo's death, and then his return to life. The year of its release, everyone was so upset by Jar's stupidity. Jar, they did not realize that the very end of The Matrix made him look like Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with the One, and I love you" ... Come on !!! How could the whole world forget how terrible it was? <br /> <br /> So what do the Wachowski do in the sequel? Well, they improve the end of the original. How? Well, by doing almost exactly the same thing again (exchanging characters only), I think my fa and r keys would be worn out if I continued writing well before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in many ways. And to make matters worse, it's not a film with insufficient budget. It's not a movie with a short schedule. This is not a film that has been hastily released. It's not a movie where too much influence comes from outside. This is exactly the film that the Wachowski intend to do with Warner's fortune entirely behind them. And that's what makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it does not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst film ever? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and distorting film ever made. <br /> <br /> Undeniably. <br /> <br />
