Someone will have to explain to me why some films featuring the poor and adopting a pseudo-gravelly aspect are somehow considered "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic about the characters. (though the actors do their best with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I witnessed a forced and conscious effort to get "pissed off", "grainy" and "shot and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than holding the camera by hand without rhyme or reason and not turning on the film to achieve any of the above-mentioned qualities significantly. <br /> <br /> It's a sad commentary on the state of the independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays true copies, with bad cinematography, a nonexistent camera direction and many swear words trying to pretend to be "the Art". <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that movies like "In the Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such raves. I found them very sinuous and very mediocre, but compared to the large number of independent clones of the type "Raising victor Vargas", they are really brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, an "independent" movie was shown meant that you would probably be treated with some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe with some technical problems caused by the low budgets, nowadays this means that you will probably have chances of getting another one by the number, -Shake-the-camera-around-during-two-hour-try to calm the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course, all this to serve characters and situations completely unreal and artificial. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving businesses? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that only copy the worst movies that preceded them.
