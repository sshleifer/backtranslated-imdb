It's the most ridiculous and laughable thriller I've ever seen. Oh ... where to start ... <br /> <br /> Intrigue (how little): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a frantic young billionaire in desperate need of a graft. Clay was secretly betrothed to her mother's AP, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night of their secret wedding, it turns out that a heart donor with the same rare blood group is found. Go and calculate the chances of that one! Once on the operating table, Clay discovers that the anesthesia does not work and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay seems to be able to filter the pain of a sharp knife cutting open his chest by simply focusing on his memories of Samantha, which is told to us by the way an annoying voice-off that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet burst out laughing, you will surely begin to see the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire agree to a heart transplant done by a surgeon, a nurse, a doctor and an anesthetist drunk? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too ridiculous to be taken seriously ... the operating room is not even sterile ... people can practically walk in and out of the room without even washing. During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. Ah ... but here's what it's about ... the doctors try to kill him to take his money. By believing him unconscious, the wicked speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference in the hospital, whereas an incompetent doctor who is the subject of four malpractice suits is engaged in a major cardiac surgery . Even Clay's overprotective mother does not seem to be able to check her status. Samantha is the only person who wants to stay up to date ... but oh no ... Sweet Sam could she know ... You'll know it quickly thanks to a Scooby Doo dialog box ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter whether or not Clay is sensitized to anesthesia, because the end would have been the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you could ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who have been victims of anesthesia awareness. Maybe there's a silly fun to have ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
