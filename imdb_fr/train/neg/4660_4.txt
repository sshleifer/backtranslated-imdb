At first glance, this gives the impression that it will be a laughable film of blaxploitation, and it contains moments when it settles in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than one would expect and is a respectable effort to describe racial problems in the WWII era army. The recognizable cast is random, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams doing better. However, Stephen Boyd stops a little before twirling his bushy mustache in a star-shaped turn too bulky. <br /> <br /> The obviously weak budget leads to an inconsistency in the values ​​of production. The locations are excellent, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" had killed half of the pack in the same way as Vin Diesel's Caparzo (except that we see the shot because the effects can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove away. in a jeep and shot down five Germans for the climax. Yet the outcome, with the heroic soldiers who receive no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyd's racist captain being so affected, are convincing, as are the sequences of Turman's character writing in a newspaper. of his imaginary exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short, "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" does not quite succeed. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. This could be redone as a very good movie, and, in its current form, is an interesting effort.
