I can not believe anyone thought there was something original or interesting in this film. I'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next, and I can even enjoy old movies with ridiculous premises as long as they're written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my acclaimed review of Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could have explained better why I should, for a second, take seriously the basic idea of ​​this film . The problem is not that producers have a small budget: they did not care. <br /> <br /> Now, publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose rave reviews appear on the box: <br /> <Chicago Tribune <br/> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br> /> Guardian of San Francisco Bay <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the latter two, but their film Credibility has made its way, but I know that if I make a film with a portable camera, a derisory plot and stupid effects, I will show them to these reporters and remind them of what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
