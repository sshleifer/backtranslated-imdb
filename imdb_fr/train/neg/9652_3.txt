The film was written 10 years ago and a different director anticipated it, with SRK and Aamir in leading roles <br /> <br /> The film was finally shot with Vipul Shah and the director. Ajay and Salman play together after a decade. HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> However, the film is disappointing because of its handling of the 90s and its worst loopholes <br /> <br /> The film tries to incorporate too much of commercial ingredients. Is there a love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, too filmed and too clich√© <br /> <br /> There are loopholes like the one where Ajay flees London airport and makes a place without anyone? even if the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half improves with the transformation of the story that Ajay destroyed Salman, but unfortunately, the climax is short and the film ends on a bad note. <br /> <br /> Direction of Vipul Shah is ordinary to below average Music is the most critical point, most songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ajay gives his best plan, though not convincing as a Rock singer, but it is superb as a negative role Salman however irritating with his Punjabi and his absurd remarks, he only impresses when he is drugged. Asin is nothing great. Ranvijay should stick to MTV. Om Puri is fine.
