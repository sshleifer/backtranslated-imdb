SPOILERS Too often, Shakespeare's adaptations to Hollywood entertain movies. Beautifully drawn, they are well interpreted and faithful to the text. The films featuring Branagh's "Henry V" and 1993's "Much Ado About Nothing" are powerful works. Watching "Love's Labor's Lost" is so disappointing that waiting so desperately for it to be lost. Unfortunately, "Love's Labor's Lost" is awful! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends gave up alcohol and women for three years to concentrate on their studies. The plans, however, begin to collapse upon the arrival of the enigmatic Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and his entourage. Soon, love is in the air and philosophy exceeds the spirit of the prince. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. Intelligently moved into a 1930s musical of Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the scenario remains, but it has now been sacrificed for the sake of a disastrous musical taste. Classics like "The way you look tonight", "Let's face music and dance", "I'm in heaven" are all destroyed by a weak song and a strong feeling that they do not just do not belong to here. <br /> <In addition to weak vocals, we are also seeing an increasing number of uncomfortable performances by ordinary stars. Ken Branagh and his friends might like to make this film, but they provide us with a set of rotating roles. <br /> <br /> The eight main actors (four men and four women) are all equally disastrous and the only positive point On their behalf, this is a significant step forward compared to the impressive Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one film leaves the film worthy of praise, it is the magnificent Nathan Lane. Over the years, Lane has proven himself to be a comedy genius, and in this feature film he once again adds humor to Costard jester. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves praise for Branagh's original version of an old tale. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. Low actor, played, sung and built, "Love's Labor's Lost" is perhaps Shakespeare's weakest adaptation of the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made. A mediocre and disappointing choice of Branagh and I hope his next effort will be better.
