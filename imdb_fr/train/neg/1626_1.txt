This film was recently aired on local television in South Africa, and I thought I would warn even those who like to watch low quality movies (which I do) that it's not even fun. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. A few unknowns appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, visibly shot in the early seventies, consists of extremely wide shots of people walking, in real time and very slowly, from A to B. This makes the film tedious. to the extreme and the expected results in blood and blood never occur. I'm really curious - how many people have watched this from start to finish?
