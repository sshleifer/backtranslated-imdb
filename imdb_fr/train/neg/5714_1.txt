I've seen a lot of good Korean movies, including thrillers and darker movies, but this one is bad. The director seems to be a sadist, who had someone who would produce junk food. The film has no entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe anyone really made such a movie. Even if playing is good, the scenario and the feeling he leaves is awful. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I will not see any of this director's films. No sense of film making, and the disappointment of having thriller moments. All this consists in showing scenes where the psychopath is wasting the reels with badly turned scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that it makes the sensations strong. Movie very disappointing and I highly recommend skipping all movies of this type.
