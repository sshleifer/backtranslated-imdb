In SÃ£o Paulo, teenagers of the high middle class, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel, have just joined the university and, on the eve of the opening class, they go to a party with drugs and alcohol . The next day, after their classes, the date of Cristiano the night before comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, scares Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking his neck. The trio decides to drop and burn the corpses in a dump, but the same night, other tragedies occur. <br /> <br /> The controversial and shameful "Cama de Gato" is a pretentious bullshit about the alienation of youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian film I've seen over the years. The shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a comedy of bad taste of black humor. The scenario is not funny, with stupid dialogs and lines, and boring, manipulative and silly sequences with interviews with stupid teenagers, at the beginning and the end. The acting is terrible, apparently with a lot of improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed by the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash. The camera, the framing, the cinematography and editing are amateur and very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many areas, it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably an advantage, because this film is nil). The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre film in a very bad marketing of sexual exploitation. My vote is an (awful). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("The cat's bed")
