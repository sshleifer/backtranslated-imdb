Marty (Simon Scuddamore), the school nerd, is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates and then finds himself in a laboratory explosion (triggered by them too) where his face is marked by acid. Years later, all fools are invited to return to high school (closed since) for a meeting. What they did not know is that Marty invites them to kill them. Then a storm begins, they are locked in the school and Marty begins to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty ridiculous. The murders are inventive and bloody and there are some scary atmospheric shots of the deserted school - but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is undressed, his head is soaked in a toilet AND is burned) and he is simply uncomfortable to watch. Since Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after its publication, it is almost impossible to see them. In addition, this film does its best to have nudity. There's all you need on Scuddamore (which is surprising for any movie), but a girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know that a murderer is chasing them! And then there is the couple who must have sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone is going to be and can teleport to them. It ends with a twist that made me moan and rolling eyes and another twist that made me want to throw something heavy on TV! The acting is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is here too. She is a very beautiful woman but not a lot of actress. <br /> <br /> This gives a 3 for truly bloody murders and atmosphere. Otherwise, it is common and forgettable. The tragic suicide of Scuddamore has given this film more attention than it deserves.
