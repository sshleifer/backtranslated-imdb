After a long time in space, in search of the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden), is missing. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plans a diabolical plan, using stolen crystals at the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new country and submerge the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many delicious Superman movies with Christopher Reeve unforgettable, or television shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a big wait was created for the return Superman in this version of Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many useless parts, a lack of emotion and an overestimation in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully ridiculous. Kate Bosworth, a twenty-two-year-old actress, plays the role of a mature journalist and an experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager, Clark Kent, in "Smallville". Parker Posey's character, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. Last but not least, although he is an excellent Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five, so older and older than the rest of the main cast. The old-fashioned conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The return of Superman"
