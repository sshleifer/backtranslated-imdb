This film has been so badly written, realized and played that it is about belief. It should be redone with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals, on the one hand, refined, professional and quite credible, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who makes a miserable mistake in bread and shocks in this particular room. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are simply awful as a couple owning (and now) a slave, although both usually do a great job. The actors (and the director) should never have tried to make accents - they are incoherent and unbelievable. Better to focus on work in English. The casting is ridiculous. Why were the children of an "African" merchant (so less socially desirable for the society of people of color) chosen with actors of very pale skin, while Marcel, so-called socially desirable, pronounced African traits, including a visibly tinted blond? It's as if casting directors should not be bothered to read the script they've composed and to choose appropriate actors from a wide range of extremely talented and physically diverse color actors. It's so weird! This could be a good movie and should be redone, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and competent actors. There are a lot of good actors, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with proper cast, good script and decent direction.
