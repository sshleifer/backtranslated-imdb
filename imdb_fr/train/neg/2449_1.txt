Bashki is to be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great English fiction works into a film, before slapping him for the attempt. The animation was mediocre, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was deafening and the movie was a dilapidated blitz in the first and a half book of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my disappointment and disgust for the film when I saw it for the first time. Now, I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is doomed to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is simply pathetic . Bashki is capable of a lot more.
