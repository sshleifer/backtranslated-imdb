Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects would have been amazing. A better staging could have given more impression and better performances to the actors. But just giving the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Holes pierced, bad lines, terrible rhythms, endless repetitions of the same shots of a CGI dragon trampling in the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
