This film is poorly designed, misinterpreted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly boring and can not escape the same routine of Napolean Dynamite. In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same maniacal and excessively obsessed mother, who cares too much and yet not enough for her children's lives (see Because I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally like her, also plays an insipid idiot in this film. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is ok, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please, skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
