It's not a movie. This is a set of unrelated, poorly designed and poorly assembled scenes that resemble the unprecedented results of a 10-year-old kid with a mini-DV camera. In fact, my theory is that the extremely abrasive girl in the corridor of the train - the one with greasy hair, the lost look, the iPod and the nervous tic - probably photographed her herself in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you have exceeded the ten minutes that I took, do not try to match what you saw in the context of the mentality of the European artist mentioned above. This is a real and complete waste of time, money and film that would have thrilled William One-Shot Beaudine. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate thing is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what's going on for a lot of humanity. <br /> <br /> And then? Six directors had social relations at the Wal-Mart snack bar?
