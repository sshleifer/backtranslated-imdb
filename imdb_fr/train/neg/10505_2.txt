If you liked "Blair with", you'll like this one. He has the same camera work and the same soundtrack, and he has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments. He also has Tom Savini, so if you like "The dawn of the dead" Romero Tarantino and Rodriguez "From dusk to dawn" waiting for you. He is also an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This film is definitely the ugliest film I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies - bad movies too. I can tell you that most horror movies are entertaining in some ways, but it was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie to 2 instead of 1 is the naked girls and the hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... No, I kidding. I must have missed before clicking on "Submit" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if there are sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
