'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a TV sequel to the original film 'The Omen'. Instead of Satan's having a little boy's body, he has the body of a little girl adopted by wealthy parents, bullied at school and finally getting revenge on those who hurt her. The film seems to fight against all the horror factors, and most of the events that unfold are just idiotic rather than particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan even with all the events surrounding her . I just did not find this movie very suspensory or scary, especially compared to the original.
