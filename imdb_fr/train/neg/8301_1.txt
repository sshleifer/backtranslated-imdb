Really bad. Why anyone thinks it's a good movie and even less funny is a real mystery. I love comedies as much as the next man and I loved "A Christmas story". The fact that he has the same director and relies on the memoirs of the same author completely amazed me why this film is a total failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is unfortunately a bad father as a beginner's father. For another, it does not seem to have the same pace - it just does not work well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joie de vivre that permeated the first film is completely absent here - you just want the film to end. I would not even recommend this movie to the curious who liked "A Christmas story". It's so bad. 1/10.
