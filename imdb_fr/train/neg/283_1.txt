For the movie, this movie looked like one of those specials after school, only a reduced budget and all the rest. I guess it was supposed to be an inspiring movie, but it did not work for me. like the preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance, but so what? There is no excitement in this film. The dialogue is artificial and cliche to death. Of course, the whole film looks like a bad shot of the 80s. The play was less than astonishing, although it has a lot to do with what the actors were given (or in this case-not) with whom to work. Above all, there are bad choices of songs, with very bad words. I felt embarrassed for all the actors involved. They all have talent, but you can not tell from this movie. This is just my opinion of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a 1 / 10
