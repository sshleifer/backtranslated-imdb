The only thing I remember about this movie are two things: first, at twelve, even though I thought it smelled bad. Secondly, it was so bad that when Mad magazine parodied it, they quit after the first page and wrote a warning at the bottom of the page, saying they had completely disavowed it. you want to see great sophomore comedies from this period, try Animal House. It is so stupid and vulgar that it is reduced to great art. Another good choice would be Caddyshack, the classic with Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before becoming boring, with beautiful replicas like that of green goaltender Carl Spackler. I'm going to lock myself up and throw the key. "
