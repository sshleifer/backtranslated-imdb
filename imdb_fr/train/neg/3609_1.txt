It must be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago, at the time of the initial broadcast of the video, and for some strange reason, I thought I appreciated it. So, like an idiot, I failed to buy the DVD once out ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother to enter the plot because it is so transparent that you can see it anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheese gore effects and acting, but these people take it to a whole new level. It's almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst film humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they were successful. If they were going to make a movie that would scare you or make you believe in any way, that's right, then they failed ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the plot and you've seen it!
