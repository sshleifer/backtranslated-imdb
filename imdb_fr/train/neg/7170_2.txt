Yikes blew this movie. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I thought it could not be too bad because Christoper Walken, oops. He had to do that because he was bored and needed the money. The characters were supposed to be Irish but nobody had Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something nice about it, I can not except that Walken did a good job with a wooden character. Find something to read or watch a discovery, never watch this movie.
