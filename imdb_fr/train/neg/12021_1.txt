It may be a little hard for me to say, but unfortunately so far in his career as a director, it's true. Just look at what he has done so far. They have barely passed the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was exceptional in this film, her performance carries the entire film. I hope she will get a blockbuster and enter the biggest league of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not as impressive, typical television game style. <br /> <br /> The film is strangely classified in the category of horror films. Flashbacks are the only "horror", and they last a maximum of 2 to 5 seconds with a little blood. Personally, I would call it more a "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But whatever the interest of the story, a bad staging, editing and staging (except Lucy) destroy it. You do not get a real connection with the actors, which is very important in a story like this. You sit there feeling nothing. It's like watching a bad soap opera .... in fact, I think the soap opera would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better still stay away from anything that affects you Michael Hurst is involved in.
