First, it is a very dated film, not centered on the leftist political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to no longer be intellectual (which in itself is quite absurd, since the answer was obtained by an intellectual), it leads me to despair; as if we all become monkeys again in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves in the highest degree possible. But there is no doubt that this non-educational message is linked to the use of rock music by Godard; hence the Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", which we are witnessing, and from which the film gets its name, is nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not particularly original, was used much better in Led Zeppelin's "Thankyou" (Led Zeppelin II). Aside from that, "Sir" Mick Jagger was declaiming in his usually nebulous way (a bit like Bob Dylan) - notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginably repeated to form the verse. <br /> <br /> The Black Panthers represented in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and today (in fact, a message that belies the behavior of the Rolling Stones at the time the film was shot). <br /> <br /> No wonder, the DVD came for free with the Sunday Times! Listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore", which presents a profound historical exhibition on leftist sympathy.
