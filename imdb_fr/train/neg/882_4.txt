There is a reason for it to go straight to the video: the story is sneaky, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a shady way, sex in the churches, and other scenes that border on the tasteless flavor (like that of the laundry room) of this movie. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold agrees - but the film itself, with its themes of degradation and revenge, is not well done. But it's a good movie for quizzes because few people have seen it.
