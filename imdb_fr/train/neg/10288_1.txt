First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show !!! But this episode ... this episode makes fun of the whole series. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they tried to do with this episode but they managed to create the worst episode of the series. <There is no scenario, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are shit. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "what do the furlings look like" by creating this stupid "previously on ..." ... ..... is just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's clear that the editors are running out of ideas and that's a shame.
