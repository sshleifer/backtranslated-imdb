I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a class C porn movie with one major difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue need a complete overhaul. Maybe the bad acting would not have been so visible. At the very least, the pace should have been resumed. <br /> <br /> I agree that the budget was low and that the director did a good job visually given the limited resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better again, ask someone else to write it. Most action scenes were in vain. <br /> <br /> It was a total loss of time.
