Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the cinema. Moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the film. After seeing Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a timid, unsentimental attempt that expressed only the lack of conviction and focus of the film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The scene of the end, a scene of free rape / torture between men, appeared as nothing less than a fantasy of rape of female vengeance. However, the film does not even follow that. Instead, the stretched scene (where the FAR surpasses the brutality of the initial rape both because of its graphic design and ritualization) is crowned with a Dawson's face-shot expressing either a regret or 'fix what whether "while the rape of his rapist is heard continuing in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not a shock, but a problem of confusion as to the nature of such a graphic scene trying to make the audience understand.I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Are we looking forward to Dawson's vengeance? Are we disgusted by the The brutality of all this, do we feel Dawson's unfortunate moment of clarity Apart from this failure, the film is somewhat awkwardly punctuated with more style than substance.The characters are skinny, the dialogue is monotonous , etc. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try to take thread ms as they see fit, but Descent did not really seem to know what it was. Thumbs down.
