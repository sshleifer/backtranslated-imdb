This film was the most beautiful Mormon film ever made. This gave the impression that the RM & Sons of Provo films were well made! It was supposed to be funny from what I was told. The best part was the best actor of the film, Travis Eberhard. If he had not been in the movie, it probably would not have been done! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. It was beaten 8. He had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character made no sense. It was made in Provo 6. He did not make fun of Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller in It was the first movie that Clint Howard was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4, a comeback 2. They should have played at auditions of surreal life 1. It was directed by Halestorm Entertainment !!
