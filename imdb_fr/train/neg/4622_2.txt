No wonder this movie was never released. The timing of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already "jumped the shark" at the time of the film's release, so who would pay money just to see some of the censored clips of the original series? And the excerpts of the show are just a small excerpt from this pathetic groan of 90 minutes Chuck Barris on the hardness of his life as the host of the show. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his millionaire life in ruins? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW his life? (Of course, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA agent.) Did he think the gag to have everyone, to audition for him, would stay cool for 90 days? minutes? Or the network executive harassing him at every turn? It could have been a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not a feature film. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the comedian unknown (though, to make the film "spicy", they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone pointed out, this is the first important part of Phil Hartman's movie (although it only lasts a minute). Note that his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which corresponds to the name with which he was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expressions, even though he is much thinner and younger than at the time of the SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
