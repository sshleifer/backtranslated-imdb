I do not see enough game shows to understand the appeal of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I guess it has a certain appeal for a less demanding audience. In appearance, a game show, it offers candidates huge amounts of money to answer a few simple questions. However, his quiz elements play only a minor role in the procedure, which I find extremely complicated. For example, before answering a question, a candidate selects the question to ask by choosing among random choices "A", "B" or "C". Is it used for anything other than slowing down the game? It would be much faster just to start with "A." Candidates may submit questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the candidate is asked to "lock" the answer - another delay tactic. The candidate's next task is to name the wife of a dozen dancers in go-go cages to reveal a card indicating the value of the question. A correct answer adds the dollar amount of the card to the candidate's cumulative total; a wrong answer subtracts the same amount. This time-consuming step is actually an entertainment value, as it allows the audience to take a close look at the lightly dressed and evenly beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the candidate is reminded that an unfortunate selection of the "killer card" will end the game instantly. This naturally sweats the candidate and causes additional delays, the nervous candidate considering the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I suspect that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the main attraction of the show. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is slowed down even more by an empty joke between host William Shatner and the competitor, with occasional routines by the caged dancers. All of these delays take so much time that it is possible for audiences to forget what the initial question is when the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute JEOPARDY episode often goes through as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM I watched only asked six questions (many of which related to other TV shows). No one in his mind would watch this show because it's fun to answer questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a competitor reacts if he is about to win up to a million dollars, he only loses all of a sudden. <br /> <br /> B. Watching beautiful young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. To take advantage of William Shatner's glittering joke. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women do not spend enough time in front of the camera to justify an hour of this show.
