At first, I became interested in this film after reading a review claiming that this film was reminiscent of the one who wrote Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Silent Hill and disappointed with his film debut, I thought I'd give this idea. a chance. Mind, Fearnet mentions this film as "Dark Floors", not by its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought about the band (I had some friends at the college who like them), but I did not think it was important and quickly rejected this idea. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts strong. Despite the fact that "the frightening little girl" was made to DEATH, the good use of audio and the sense of isolation really began to reconstruct the story. The tense atmosphere was building quickly and everything indicated that the film was excellent. As the monsters are the real stars of the horror, I can not wait to see what is hidden in the corridors of the hospital in which the main characters were trapped ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed up and I found myself very disappointed. At the moment of the second appearance, I am amazed by the fact that it seems to come from a Megadeth concert, and stupidity completely dispels me. <br /> <br /> During the film, the atmosphere remained intact, and the story let you ask what was happening, but fears were almost non-existent. However, I had hoped that the end would be worth it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. By the time the film reached its peak, I was completely incredulous and I immediately recognized the big bad guy in his final revelation ... Lordi's lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was it the movie? A group of poor people pursued around a hospital by members of the Lordi Band? The stupid monster design suddenly made sense. If you want to be as nerdy, do it as well with Marilyn Manson members, or even with KISS. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure I saw the end of a video clip of Lordi a few years ago. They had to go make an entire movie? <br /> <br /> Worse, when I discovered what was really happening, I could only manage a yawn. I will not "ruin" it for you, but I can safely say that it's probably a conspiracy device you've seen before. More than likely once. <br /> <br /> So, unless you're a big fan of Lordi, stay away. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does decent work by borrowing from other horror movies, mostly Silent Hill). And I can not emphasize it too much, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI. You talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, you'd better try to scare yourself by watching Slipknot's music videos. In other words, it is simply not possible.
