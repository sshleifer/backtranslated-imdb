Just so that other moviegoers understand this movie, I decided to write another review. I missed a few things last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, the acting game. Third, Jesus Christ, what did they think of doing such a trash and then expect us to enjoy it when there is no redemptive characteristic from beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes finally flew away? in front of a climax little exciting !!! I can not believe that I wasted my money on that when I could have given it to a homeless person, a street vendor or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Do you receive the photo?
