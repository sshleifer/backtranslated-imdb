Okay, the glimpses of this movie only tell you that a rebellious girl is going to live with her grandmother in the summer to recover. This is not the case! This is a 17-year-old rebellious girl who reveals a secret and it is up to her mother to believe whether she is telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a very good plot and a very good love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I did not like watching Lindsay Lohan play. In fact, this movie would have been great if they had someone else, perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very aggressive person in terms of sex and she reminds us in some way the real Lindsay, which takes a lot of the film. <br /> <br /> But I think if you put Lindsay aside, you'll appreciate this movie. The end is pretty good (and sad).
