Whoever made this film must have done it as a joke. I mean, it was the most stupid movie I've ever seen !! A killer snowman terrorizes a small town? Leave me alone. I love it when he gets behind the wheel of the police car. Rather a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, praise this. If you really want a horror movie, stay away from this one!
