Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you have tried so much. This is your big title, a shining example to the rest of us that you certainly deserve a nomination to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you state on your 1998 website). Alas, it is better to remain silent and pretend to be crazy than to speak and to remove all doubt. With Ben & Arthur, that's exactly what you do. <br /> <br /> Apparently assembled with a lack of education or education, the film's scenario guides us to a truly bizarre reality with each new scene. It is this crazy excuse of a story that could also be the best ally of the film. At first warm, Ben and Arthur, two very homosexual characters, try to get married, even fly over the country, in the shade of the most beautiful palm trees in Vermont. But all these postures are just an introduction for BLOOD. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, there must be at least 20 dollars of fake blood in the last third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe. From sound to editing to music, which consists of a fuzzy bass note held on a keyboard, it is amazing that the film even hangs on the medium on which you look at it. It's a shame that good amateur performances are ruined here. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you've done five digits on this movie in rentals or anything that drives poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we do not laugh with you.
