Why Hollywood feels the need to remake films that were so brilliant at their peak (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes) but that is much worse why Hollywood feels the need to redo these horror movies that were not not brilliant to start Night, The Amityville Horror) Just like their originals, these remakes fail to create an atmosphere, a character or a real fright. The dance night is so flat and uninteresting that it is hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It is a poorly executed, extremely uninteresting and ultimately boring excursion that is lacking in everything it is meant to do. It is clear that Hollywood Horror is dead. Even bands like The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have managed to ruin their franchise with style, with buckets of blood and a decent plot. The night of the ball is practically bloodless and I will not even say how bad the plot is. His inability to seal the names of the killers makes it the least suspensive horror since ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious slasher movies of the 1980s is terrorizing moviegoers with this remake that proves how ugly dances in high school can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to leave the past behind and celebrate in style her senior prom. <br /> <br /> When the big night arrives finally, Donna and her best Friends prepare to enjoy their last big explosion of high school by partying and partying until the early morning. But while Donna is willing to look beyond her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she escaped forever is back for a final dance. An obsessed killer is on the run, and he will kill anyone who tries to stop him from reaching his one and only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive the day of graduation and what will Donna do when forced to face her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis co-perform the slasher remake that will allow teenagers in tuxedo to look nervously over their shoulder as they head for the dance floor. A plot that will probably discourage you from going to see that. If you ask me, the witch is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without too much work, McCormick gaily tries to dispel the tension that prevails in the most mundane situations. At one point, a girl lies down in a lamppost (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it in a moment of a start. Desperate times really call for desperate measures. There have not been so many closet plans since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> At the time of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is probably a scary and scary movie to be exploited from the commodification of glamor and the terrifying obsession with society for youthful beauty. This is not this movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will love Prom Night, it's even a disappointment for those who generally appreciate the remakes of hacks. Given his absolute lack of blood or scares. One night you will be in a hurry to forget.
