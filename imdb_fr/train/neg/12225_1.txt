My personal vision of hell is to stay locked in a room without being able to close my eyes or plug my ears and play this movie for all eternity on all surfaces available in this room. The idea that Streisand plays a boy / man is just beginning to show how ridiculous this movie is. The most important thing about watching a movie is the concept of "deliberate suspension of disbelief". . . it's impossible to do that in this movie.
