I really do not understand why some people find the Power Rangers TV show very interesting. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people who play them also look completely idiotic. There is absolutely nothing interesting about Power Rangers. This is just a higher-priced television advertisement designed to sell high-grade plastic waste to unsuspecting children around the world. According to the notes, I see that this has been banned in New Zealand and, from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
