If at least the cruelty and the trained deaths had a purpose in history to justify their inclusion, but the script was simply incomprehensible and just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> He was not going anywhere, the story had no legible continuity. It was just a bunch of endless snuff scenes and a really stupid end, as if to say .. "The end * beeps you my enemies and my few defenders who watch my garbage." <br /> <br /> I do not understand, a masked murderer who never had his mask removed in prison, a rape scene in prison that was supposed to be that of the guards raping an ugly and deformed serial killer and being killed by him and nothing else? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main cop character who was a mess of actor like Pare, who did not try to defeat the guy who killed his cops, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and you sent them to watch video. <br /> <br /> Cops who, for some unknown reason, went astray in the dark by themselves (individually) in his farm house at night, like a group of poorly written teen characters The time is like a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman hears them dying in the dark one after the other and keeps wandering for no reason until everyone is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> A lot of horrible snuff scenes from real life at first without reason or explanation, did he remember himself, was he watching him masturbate, was it a comedy for him ... what was it? Nope Boll just thought to throw it to annoy the animal lover ... whatever. and then Par√©, thinking that a psychopath would let his family go if he killed himself ... a more credulous and stupid policeman than you've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to totally dislike his works. I'm trying to find a reason to explain the art of horror writers but that sort of thing ... pure shit. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing now? I hope you will understand because I know many more deserving people who can not dream of getting the budget that you get over and over again to make their movies. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Boll at his best start "Postal" it was actually good.
