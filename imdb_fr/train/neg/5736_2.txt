It's one of the worst movies I've seen in years! You can randomly remove 5 people from the street and act better than anyone in this movie. Loss of absolute time to watch. I only gave him a 2 because I like the bloody movies, but it's just hogwash. The acting game (and I use this term very vaguely) is catastrophic. Can anyone tell me that the 5 main actors of this film made their first film ?? Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was a better movie by some means. I can not believe anyone has spent money doing that, I hope for the producer, it only costs $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project, made by kids who do not have no idea. Has it even been in the cinema?
