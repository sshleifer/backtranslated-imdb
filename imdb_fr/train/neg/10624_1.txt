In a good review, loleralacartelort7890 states: "The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation alloy, which is not well known, and the exact specifications are a secret, and why is it a secret? If they were participating in a space race with the Russians, it would be VERY stupid to reveal that they had a new technology that could protect their crews against radiation. "This is completely false. There was (and was) no "secret" of radioprotection at Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Control Module has been available to the public for a long time. It uses a lightweight "honeycomb" made of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire exterior surface (with the exception of the windows of course) is covered with a phenolic resin heat shield, which is thicker at the back and faces the front during re-entry. These materials are actually * better * to stop the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stop ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Spatial Radiation is a definite problem for long-term * space flight * because of the risk of large solar flares. But it was just not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The control module provided them with a good enough protection during their brief passage (about an hour) through the Van Allen belts. They all had dosimeters so we knew exactly how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of which landed), 18 are still alive. Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer) died of cancer. The others died as a result of a heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually very good statistics for a group of men under the age of 70 (Shepard is 86).
