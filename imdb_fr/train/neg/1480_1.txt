He pulled the guys out of the belly! Is this a parody? Nobody really writes that this is happening as an improvisation that went terribly wrong. I think no matter how. This film must be a parody, because who would say that they wrote this script otherwise. Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting while the director and screenwriters examine the script? <br /> <br /> The director says: "Our evil consanguine then uses his 24-inch machete to eject our frightening neighbor, will pull the guts out of his bung" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant!" entire distribution proclaims itself. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to happen, no one writes that stupid! I have to be a parody. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where the introspective skinny girl beats to death the inbred monster with the cast iron pan she finds on the floor of the cave. I was not sure that the inbred cannibal types took the trouble to cook a lot. Perhaps this explains why the pan was lying on the floor in the dark at the right time to kill the thug. It seems ironic that after the weird guy defeated the porn queens martial arts expert and a couple of door-type jocks, he falls so easily in front of the frying pan of a helpless skinny girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this Richard Greco guy doing? Did he fire his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can someone explain to me the end please because I did not have it either? I can not understand why the nice girl of the hero wanted to kill the funny woman who was making tea for her. No matter, I do not want to know.
