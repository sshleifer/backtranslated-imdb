We can start with the wooden game but this film is a disaster. Having grown up in New York, I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who gets to know the community or the people. I'm not even an advocate of culture in any way and I found it to be a Hollywood rubbish that fits his own fictional and ridiculous presentation of culture and language that anyone who Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. It is a colossal waste of time and, worse still, not quite interesting, because the result is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who acts this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The name of the author seems Israeli or something, but it is clear that he has no idea of ​​the subject on which he writes. Looking at his biography, he is shocked that he lived in New York and wondered what was the real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films like "A stranger among us" are better and closer to the truth than this moron. Reading the credits of this type, it is not surprising that he wrote scripts on all category C movies that feature stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this scenario is even lower than normal for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
