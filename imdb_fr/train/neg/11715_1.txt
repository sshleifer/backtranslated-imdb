haha! you just have to smile and smile if you have succeeded throughout this movie. it's like saying something about me, I suppose. I think the film itself was created as a kind of psychological test, or as a kind of drug, to take you to a place where you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his tractacus (sp?), His first famous philosophical article, he said that it made no sense and was useless, but if you read it, once you're finished, it would lead you to a new level, like a ladder, then you could throw the job and see things with clarity and understanding. This film is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> As a film, it's without a doubt the worst film I've seen in a very long time in such a unique way. First of all, it's about snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies. and I suffered through a few weak ones. However, although you know that the film could be bad, you never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was. which is funny I mean they are snipes. you know it might be good, but everything will be fine, right? smile. <br /> <br /> Thus, this thing at all levels is a pure boredom, a pure non-originality. the reference to the professional is both obvious and obvious, but it is so badly made that it is comical. there is not a single character in this film that is interesting, at least. and to make it all more surreal, they have a soundtrack that looks like parts of various Bourne-style movies, but that's not quite right. In fact, although it sounds close to the action movie background music, it turns out it's done in a way that will gratify you in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> all scenes are totally black, where honestly Since the characters are so flat, you do not really care what will happen, but no matter, after that happens and that someone one to be killed, you say to yourself, was I supposed to see that? what else? how about scenes with blinding and odious flashes at a stroboscopic pace, for a period too long to bear. Of course, let's throw this in there. when you strive and your eyes can not bear it, do more in the darkness where you really do not see what happened. and on top of that, let's face it, you do not care. You have been bored from the beginning. <br /> <br /> So I fell into the water a few times, but I caught almost all of this film. and it becomes something you can look at, without something that engages your mind at any level, therefore, it becomes something that you can effectively mask and start thinking about your life, where it's going, where it's going was, what we are people. <br /> <br /> and ... that's the real magic of this movie.
