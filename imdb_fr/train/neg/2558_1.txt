I was supposed to consider this for a website and I looked at it with optimism. It might be at least a cheesy and fun scam, and it did not work out well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (Even worse than "Godsend") with scenes taken from "The Omen" without shame. The end is very similar to the way "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Besides the acting, the writing and the story are just tricks. If these films bring in money, I'm sad to see where Asylum is going. It's embarassing.
