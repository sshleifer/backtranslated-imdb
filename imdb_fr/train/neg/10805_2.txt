The only reason I recorded this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I always heard how horrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just squirmed and could not look at the screen when Shaq started banging and wondering why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his tooth! But in spite of all that is terrifying, we just could not stop looking, the story sucked you, like a black hole, quicksand or a pit of tar, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the bursts of laughter and just to say that we watched "Kazzam".
