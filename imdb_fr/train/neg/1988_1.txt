Okay, I had the terrible acting. I realized that Lil Kim was blowing guns and that his arms and hands were not moving, I passed the armor, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> That's what killed him for me: In the scene where the four roses sat at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, then Lil Kim gets up to break the hostilities saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold on, let's fall for a HOT SECOND." I'm a fan of Western cinema and I've never heard anyone talk about slang like that in any of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks this movie deserves more than one note, please tell me another movie It's worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I have enough.
