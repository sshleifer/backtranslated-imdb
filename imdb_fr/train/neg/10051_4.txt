I gave this 4 star because it has a lot of interesting themes that many have already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality and many taboos. Apart from blood, I would not call this horror as much as science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's dark, depressing and hopeless. Although the end is not embarrassing, I'm really tired of the clich√© "suck humans" which is at the heart of all films. I know you can not get a degree in liberal arts today without giving in to the altruism of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but what about as a writer / director? We claim to be different from others. notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil! Right now, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just get out, find a lake and swim until your arms are tired. In this way, you will not be there to direct the next movie or write the next book telling me that I deserve to die to be alive. It's silly, not thoughtful and boring.
