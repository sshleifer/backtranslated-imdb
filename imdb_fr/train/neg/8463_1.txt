No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give such a budget to do that ... In Belgium, we make ten films that win all the prizes in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director was a school film graduate or a cop? <br /> <br /> The best things in this movie were the word "End". <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell this? It's too expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy it. <br /> <br /> For me, paying for it was my big mistake of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time, I'll break my arm but buy this guy sh * t.
