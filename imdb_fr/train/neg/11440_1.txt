Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean never. My wife and I both get bored in 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it's totally amazing. Women (non-lesbians) do not bathe together - or kiss "accidentally". The brothers and sisters do not live together in their thirties and run together to dance the swing and go shopping in Central Park. Men do not discover that their wife and sister kissed romantically the night before marriage and never discuss it with their wives. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is perhaps the worst actress in the movies today. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie she's been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she did not play. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough the seriousness of this film.
