Drama / mystery of poorly written conspiracy on the possibility that AIDS is presented to the public by the government. Wlaschiha plays a homosexual researcher in search of answers - it would be difficult for anyone to find this hazy plot. Although the cinematography itself is praiseworthy, the camera craves characters of a real depth instead of playing in a shallow and amateur way, which it must unfortunately transmit. Grade: D +
