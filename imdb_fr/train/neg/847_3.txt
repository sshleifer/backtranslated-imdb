The film is about two brothers who are supposed to look alike - but do not expect to be intelligent - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write computer code. Geniuses as they like to call themselves, which seems very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics that you can perceive from the title material. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I did not like the style of the movie. I think that the anxiety, the confusion and the deep blues that it generates have a purpose, but I do not understand why there are so many things. The film is inexpensive on the scenes and tells the story without any human aspect. This gives the comic strip as an experience. Be that one that visually numbs the viewer, it makes him enter the blues with brief dialogues, monotonous scenes, a dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the film is very simple, most of what happens is being dramatically photographed for long minutes, mainly in a confusing delirium simulating the effects of drug use and dynamic cuts . <br /> <br /> I will say openly that this film did not meet a minimum my expectations.
