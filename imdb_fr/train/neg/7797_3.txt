It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard have been unjustified. this director is competent. It is hampered by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the editing, camera angles, camera movements and staging are quite professional. I saw a lot of films where the "realization" was much worse. At least, the scenes unfold in a way that does not bother and he has some clever tricks here and there. In addition, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. A VHS camera does not allow you everything you do, and it does a good job with technical details. As for artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera rocks to allow a guy to urinate in the woods for 15 seconds embodies in a way the artistic style of the entire film. It's purely a trash ... Total waste. <br /> <br /> The agenda is suitable for a movie of this budget. it is obviously wrong, but there are many, and it is very strange. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with intentionally dubbed campy. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to get through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's overkill, especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for its camp value. It is very difficult to find a film worse than this one and this places it in a unique category.
