I do not know why you watch Steven Seagal's movies, but I watch them because, stupid as they are, they are at least always good to laugh. Why would you rate this movie as a 1 in 10 based on dubbing, when that sort of thing is exactly what makes this movie a cult favorite you can laugh at ridiculous? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is certainly not a good film, but I thought it was as worthy of a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other films; In fact, I did not think it was one of his worst thunderclaps. Most of the time, there was a consistent half-way plot, and most of the time fundamentally exciting. The end was really bad, but even that included pleasantly trashy elements. In the end, the story itself did not keep its promises, but I thought that the acting of the actors, the characterization (if I can use such a big word) and the rest of the values ​​of the production offered exactly what a real Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the man at the cut stone and sensible we expected, and the rest of the cast supported him rather well, without ever staging it. That's what a movie by Steven Seagal does. Do with. Or even better: laughing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
