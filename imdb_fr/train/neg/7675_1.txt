Can we ever say that there are movies that have no usable functionality? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After directing the horrendous director of the "House of the Dead", Uwe Boll has now set his sights on another video game adaptation. These guys do not get it? For those who do not understand, here it is for you: video games do not make good movies! The role here is, at best, below the norm. The scenography and special effects are mediocre. Unlike the video game (which has experienced frightening moments), the film has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or threat. The pace and pattern are confusing and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The main responsible is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are soldered in all the sad deal at unpredictable times leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy was never left close to a movie set must remain one of the biggest secrets of modern cinemas. Avoid at all costs.
