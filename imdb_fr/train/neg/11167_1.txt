Jack Black can usually make me sneer just by breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> In addition to staging, writing, lack of intrigue, repeated aggression (aided and abetted by direct and constant shots) and an average of 0.050 at the joke stick, it was always a total waste of time. The idea seems promising, but the potential there is wasted by a total lack of comedy and one of the worst directions I've ever seen on that side of You-Tube. <br /> <br /> I constantly hear that this film is portrayed. Mexicans very negatively. While this may be true, I really do not think this movie is racist. I think it's more the result of a "creative" team trying desperately to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them screaming behind the camera: "Hey, look, this is a naughty Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the sake of all that is tenacious, LAUGH!" <br /> <br /> But put the racism charges aside. In the end, it's all those who spend a lot of money and time to watch this pile of fried bean remnants that should be offended, IMO.
