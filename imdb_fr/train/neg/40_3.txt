A model named Laura works in South America when she is abducted from her hotel room by a gang and taken to the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for his release. Peter is hired to bring her home safely and there is a bonus for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl. Peter is driven into the jungle by helicopter with his friend Jack. They try to give the kidnappers some fake money in exchange for Laura, but the plan goes terribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot down and they must also bail out (it's not going well so far). Also wandering in the jungles is a kind of devil. In reality, it's just a naked black man with strangely big eyes and a breathing problem. He starts killing some of the kidnappers and Laura escapes to be captured by primitives. The rest of the movie is really a bit blurry. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not a big fan of Jess Franco, in fact, this is only the second movie I've seen so far, but even I can say it's not is not really one of his best efforts. The movies hang at a slow pace without anything happening. Everything could have been edited quite easily in a 25-minute TV show. There are many very long shots of people walking in the jungle that could have been lifted straight up. <br /> <br /> The Devil Hunter is poorly lit (actually, I do not think he was on at all), badly doubled, badly played and slow but for some reason he did not not bored. I think the main reason was some of the hilariously bad scenes it entails. For example, a scene in which Laura is walking down the street was visibly turned into a real street as crowds of people stopped to look directly at the camera while it was spinning. Another funny scene shows one of the members of the gang who was killed, hanging in a tree, dripping blood while one of his friends was standing under him shouting for minutes. So, for no reason, the man in the tree heads falls and hits the guy under him. We must see it before believing it. Then there is of course the devil. It's just a black and naked man who, despite the fact that he has huge eyes, a very blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The film is linked to a part of the video that scares fear in the 80s in the UK and has been banned. Now why do not I know. There is very little gore and it is hardly a shocking film. Without nudity, I would have said he could almost get away with a PG. The only thing I can think of is that it was never viewed and was added to the original list because of word of mouth. <br /> <br /> There are not many reasons to watch this movie unless you are a huge fan of Jess Franco. There is a lot of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also scenes that are so bad that you can laugh at it, but otherwise I would say that you just have to pay a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
