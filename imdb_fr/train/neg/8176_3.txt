Last night, I watched this movie in anticipation, but I was not really impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo", I thought the acting was mediocre and the story was limited. It sounded like a drama "made for television". <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the film was very artificial. The whole introduction of the hammer into the context at the beginning (yes, we understand that this is Britain's 80s - you can stop now) was tedious and gave a very one-sided view of what was life in 80s Britain - poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing? There were actually middle classes that existed at the time - only ordinary workers, with a living wage and a mortgage. The Malvinas clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for "dramatic effect," I presume. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events was a little disjointed, characters moving from one action to another without us seeing how their mindset could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was curious. I could not even watch during the snapping scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only much younger but also looked much younger. I know there was only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, but it's a huge difference in your teens! In my experience, this kind of difference between teens and girls occurs only when the girl is the youngest, because girls mature much faster and get closer to boys a few years. Sorry, but I did not buy it - a useless plot point that was created for a shock value. <br /> <br /> The end was a little abrupt and, again, artificial. If the flag-throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, it became a bit short for me. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that British films are only concerned with the upper classes or the poor. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can not we suggest something different? Why are our films always so attached to the class system? I was born in 1973. My age was therefore not very different from that of Shaun in 1983. I grew up in a single-parent family in a relatively poor town in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were very different from those described in the film - I do not even remember racism as a problem (although I'm not saying it did not exist). 'It's England'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I felt that this film lacked substance and that I was completely bored and that I was not impressed.
