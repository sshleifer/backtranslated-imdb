It's the beginning of the 80s. There is a group of strangely old teenagers. And there is a maniac who stalks. Yes, it's Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This film is called Farces. Why is it called pranks? I have not got the faintest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a good joke repeatedly strikes someone's dinner with a baseball bat - all in all, not a good joke; In fact, it's a shit joke to the truth. But there. <br /> <br /> The film itself is about a group of teens who clean up a broken dormitory. They realize that a psychopath is on the run. To fight against this development, they separate and wander in the dark. He ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly done slasher movie. The DVD I watched was Vipco. There seems to be a lot of violence. This makes the DVD even more useless because, let's face it, a slasher film torn apart by violence is a waste of time. For slasher-movie and villain-only video only.
