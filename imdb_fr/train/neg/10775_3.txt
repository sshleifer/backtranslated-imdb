This movie is horrible! He rivals "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassing moments. I would have noticed it less than 3, except for some fun lines; but, overall, this movie was nil! It looked like they had spent the weekend in a bankrupt hotel somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the sidelines forever!
