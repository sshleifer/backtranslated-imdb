It really does not do justice to the blues. It does not start well with Voyager and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson, somebody who is still blind) apparently telling us about outer space (?) And telling us about the life of various blues musicians. Although tough, this could be the most interesting part of this documentary visually. Then, all that remains is actors who, with incompetence, pronounce the classic tunes, filmed in black and white, interspersed with Beck and Shemekia Copeland, who then rape the same songs. It's a good way to show why the big old Blues were so great, but that does not make the visualization fascinating. There is practically nothing here that can justify making it a film and not a radio play. No one should be forced to see these poorly made reconstructions. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially Blues. Avoid at all costs.
