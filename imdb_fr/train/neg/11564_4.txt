Italian horror / suspense movie about a rich English lord walking around pubs and taverns for red-haired girls, like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know that he really must have loved his wife, because he takes them home - a huge, rotting castle - and undresses them, tortures them, whips them and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film was for me that towards the end of the film, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the hero of the film. Anyway, soon, under the guidance of his uncle playboy Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles with a girl he meets at the party of his uncle. She enters and strange things begin to happen in De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally look at the title if you are still curious. In addition, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal way. Poor Aunt Agatha (she looks like maybe even younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and try to look old) meets her fate in a casual way. Another man is injected and buried alive. And of course, there is a whole explanation as to why / how Evelyn did what she did. The director Emilio Miraglia does quite well some things: the sets of the film are well suited to this film, although trying to make us believe that England is at best ridiculous. None of the actors look English. Many people have black hair, Mediterranean skin and clothes, an Englishman would not be caught off guard. Cars drive on the wrong side of the road. Despite everything, the scene of the crypt was filmed and I also liked the corny resolution. And of course, any film with the sensual Erika White with a red head is always an asset. There is a trail of sexual perversion; However, what I found somewhat appalling about the fact that torturing women was perfectly correct and healthy to relieve one of his mental demons. Let's go there.
