Dude, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly, where can I get one? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire turning into a werewolf. And it's not a transformation of Rick Baker 'American werewolf', people. We are talking about some of the worst makeup ever captured here. I can just imagine a stoned Italian spreading glue on the bare Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagonist of the film (is that a word?)) And asking him to roll in the fur. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> From there, the situation has not improved much. The scenes are spoiled by the scene where the male actors make fun of Daniela and his condition or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad that if we do not laugh, we will cry). <br /> <What's funny is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, it's a psychopath who rebels when there's a man (understandably, she was raped as a child) , so she thinks she's werewolf opening scene). She can not help tearing the throats of every man she meets, and she only wants to be loved! Things start to get high for Daniela who falls in love with a stuntman who does not trigger his "episodes". Look at the montage here, one of the cutest you'll ever see (laugh and hug after plunging head first through a window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's luck does not hold because the film takes a brutal turn, she is suddenly violently beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Recalling "I spit on your grave", Daniela takes a bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> It's been 100 minutes of my life that I will never come back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a movie geek.
