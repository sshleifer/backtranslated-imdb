The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian revolution. I also liked to see Budapest because the film was partly shot there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe their love story. The scenes of love were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was really stiff, almost icy. Rob Stewart was rather charming and childish, so she looked like her older sister rather than her girlfriend. The end, when we finally found who was looking for them, was rather weak and made no sense. I think I would have much better enjoyed this film if the relationship between the two actors was a little more credible.
