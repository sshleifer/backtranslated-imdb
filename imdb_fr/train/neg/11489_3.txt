In the United States, very few films on Rome were shot without being shot in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. The epics of the sword and sandals in Hollywood have a predominantly Christian theme, making it difficult to get into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and met with some resistance in Hollywood as it did not contain Jesus) /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one image that is not before the time of Caesar and Christ, but which takes place at the time when Rome was only a city among others on the Italian peninsula and had just overthrown the king hated Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, it is not a historical film; it is peplum, and although the values ​​of production are not at the base, the actors and characters are in cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue in Italian looked like, but with the English wooden dubbing, it's very campy. At first, I had a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many movies like this, I missed most of the 60's Hercules movies. It's fun to a certain extent, but as and as the movie progresses, it becomes a bit boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I had seen this movie when I was ten, I would have loved it. At that age, I was going for anything with Romans and sword fights. So at least, this movie brought back memories of childhood.
