The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there were anything else in the theater, it would be avoided by far. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 is also stinky, but I would rather see this rather than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or this other young punk, it will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
