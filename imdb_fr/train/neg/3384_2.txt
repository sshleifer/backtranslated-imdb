If you were to judge only on the film, the committee that awarded the Pulitzer Prize to the musical "A Chorus Line", and the Broadway audience that held the brunt for 15 years, were all under the weight of narcotics, because a singular sensation This film is certainly NOT. <br /> <br /> This suggested that anyone who thought Richard Attenborough was quite appropriate for this material made me quite mysterious, but he's making a musical that deals almost entirely with movement, just s sit on the screen like a piece of clay. <br /> <br /> Not content with the original score of how it was written, one person decided that the film really needed a new song to give the movie a bit of craziness. Thus, we are beset by the "Surprise, Surprise" nominated for Oscars (!). Surprise surprise, the song stinks, and the film too. <br /> <br /> Note: D
