Well ... unlike the other comments previously written, I must say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that a guy in this movie looked a bit like Jason Donavon, which reminded me of my youth . I do not know at all how he won a prize, and although I'm sure that a lot of effort was made to do it, everything was unsuccessful, the end result being a scream of foreign soap operas from the early years 90. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with a performance of one level. It was unfortunately long and the secondary intrigues were incredibly unrealistic .... for example ... if your best friend slept with your 6-year-old ex-boyfriend after only 2 weeks of breakup, you would not stay all the best of friends. It was fantasy. That's all! Oh yeah, and the weird house of the 90s house / soft indie core was stultifying!
