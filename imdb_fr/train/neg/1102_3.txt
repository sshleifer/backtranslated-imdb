First of all, I must admit that the two films I saw from this director, I saw untitled, may have missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but after watching two of his films, I would have liked not to have tried to learn. Samotari is so cool. Very cool. It is a dozen different stories that weave together. This is not unusual in a city the size of Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They have jobs and only one student. The best character is the girl from the Balkans. Every day, immigrants echo his feelings. It is more or less that. The only big character. Everyone is doing their own life of hell by themselves. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting passages with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in the film? If you like music, see this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, see this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch and not an imitation. And in NO circumstance, see Ondricek's movie, Septej (Whisper.) Unless you like homophobic stereotypes.
