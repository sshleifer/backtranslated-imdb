A young scientist tries to continue the work of his deceased father on the regeneration of members. His dominant mother convinced him that he had murdered his own father and was monitoring his progress for his own purposes. A young doctor uses the reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is torn conveniently a few minutes later, he injects his formula and develops a new murderous arm ... Certainly, the special effects of "Severed Ties" are rather good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie The Arm Cut Behaves Like a Snake and Kills Little People.Big deal.The acting is mediocre and the climax is ridiculous.3 out of 10.
