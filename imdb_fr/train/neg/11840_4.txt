Anything that could be potentially interesting in this material is poured out in the first few seconds with a warning that the events we are going to see can never be known and that "This is the whisper [of the rumor] most often reported" to about one of the most sensational "mysteries" in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> OK. So we are not getting anything new (and E's "Mysteries & Scandals" gives you a better idea of ​​the incident in question ... and it's not really an endorsement). What have we? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. No big news there. More interestingly, we learn what a director who has been washed is ready to do to regain his power within the entertainment industry and / or the political establishment. This raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks of his own experience through these characters. But what we say is so cynical, so ugly and so confused, we feel guilty to be witnesses of a bunch of nonsense who pretend to be history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has a curious quality of crazy found more irritating than pleasure. We are empathetic with no one. And the great "Citizen Kane" develops the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow" we are not always sure of Davies' motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we are told one thing, she does the other. <br /> <br /> And should we believe that Davies was the love of the chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to break the head of one of America's most powerful - and seemingly weak - citizens? The film never says it clearly. <br /> <br /> What is convincing are the production values. There is a glorious reconstruction of the yacht and period costumes. I have been more concerned with the construction of some lapels of men's jackets than with following a story that defames many of the most famous personalities in Hollywood history. Nobody will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. The renunciations that surround the film only make it even more timid and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the performers, although Meg Tilly is here parodying. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. It gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​cheerful landscapes. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but to such an extent that she seems to distance herself from the company as a whole rather than telling it. One of his first lines is: "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she would not like it. <br /> <br /> It's not up to the trash, so bad, so good Bogdanovich, it's good "At last love". He is perched on a serious attempt, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because he is so full of bitterness towards "the beast" named Hollywood. This is the movie "National Enquirer". And that sullies not only the names of those filmed on board Oneida this weekend, but the public is also very dirty.
