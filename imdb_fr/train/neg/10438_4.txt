the film was bad, it was not funny, it was not exciting. they tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. and to think that it's cool to love this movie, besides the hype, are the only reasons why this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> the fact that right now 50% have voted for 10 out of 10 this film seems rather worrying to me, that the film becomes crazy or that this vote is unrealistic and can have many causes and should be treated. anyway, it's a below-average film that has blossomed through mouth-to-mouth advertising. His success can only be described as a marvel of marketing.
