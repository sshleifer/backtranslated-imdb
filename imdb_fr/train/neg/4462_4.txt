"True" story of three girls who go to the wilderness of Connecticut and get chased by a maniac in the woods. This is the kind of film he would have played in training studios across America thirty years ago and that has garnered mixed applause. The film does not work very well with its reduced budget and mixed results. The film is watchable but not scary at all (blame some attack scenes for that). This is the kind of movie you'll probably forget once you're done. Chances are you will never think of seeing this unless it is given to you by someone and he tells you, "Look here this", that's what happened to me. If a copy is given to you, the film is not worth seeing, even if it is viewable.
