I felt obliged to watch this movie from beginning to end because I found it in a basket of bargains and I bought it for mine, but I often tried to extinguish it and crush it the money I paid. If you're a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there's one thing the filmmakers know about, it's the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a disgusting effect. If that does not interest you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This film is shot with a home video camera, with school accessories and terrible actors. It is dubbed in German, but even taking this into account, the sound is awful. This film has roughly the budget it has, with the exception of the aforementioned special effects. If they had spent a little more money in actors and a real scenario instead of blood and guts, the movie might have been a little nicer. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of three men who will land on an island inhabited by an army of masked pewter sadists. They are captured and the rest of the film is about their escape attempt. I call this a story in the vaguest sense of the term, since it is actually a series of scenes of torture and fighting united by a senseless and obscene dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing of a redemption, unless as unthinking gore. Consider yourself warned.
