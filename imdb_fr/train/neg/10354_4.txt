I was browsing Netflix and came across this movie. Having fond memories of the book as a child, I decided to check that out. It's a movie you really should go through. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth seeing. It's very boring and uninteresting. I think that would be the same for small children. The book contains no magic. This film is not horrible, but you will not worry about it after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that seem weird. The witch character is not very good. The family acts as if it does not matter that these strange things happen. I know it's a children's film, so as an older audience, we do not have to look too deeply into things, but the whole film gives the impression that it was written and produced by people who have never had experience in making movies. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I started jumping in the last moments of the movie and instead of trying to fix it, I just turned it off and sent back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
