I always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a total loss of 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more about Son of Sam and I had a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the serial murders of 1977. The talking dog was laughable (you know you have problems when all the clients of the film burst out laughing inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting. The sex scenes were totally irrelevant with the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but it should make sense (unless it's a XXX movie). Overall, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort!
