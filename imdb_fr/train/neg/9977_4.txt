This kid is pretty mean, but they do not make him the type that surpasses adults and can thwart experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not so much a kid, he is a child with serious emotional problems. A nice couple trying to adopt is rather tempted to adopt it and, even if the husband is a little more willing to give this kid a chance, the mother does not. Through a weird character of Michael Richards and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried, you have a rather bad movie with some laughter here and there. In fact, I prefer the rest of this movie because I like the fact that they have brought Amy Yasbeck as a friend, because there are one to many characters in this film that are totally inimitable. Even the kid is pretty annoying at first in this one, and they cool him down a little bit later. The plot is quite simple, although the future parents adopt this child they feel great to see that the orphanage organizes a party when they leave, they quickly realize that they themselves have a little hell. Add to that the little hell that comes into contact with a convict. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. Not that good, but I'll choose that before that Culkin kid any day of the week.
