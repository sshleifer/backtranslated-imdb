The only quality that redeems this film is that it was bad enough to be comic. Everyone in this movie looks like a abandonment of the porn industry. I have seen better play in pornography. I thought I rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: watch your ass Nick: watch yours (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how horrific production is, but it's really funny: good guys have transformation weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, replicas of AK-47! And then, to top it off, they trade weapons between two scenes with some M-16! I think they had a limited budget for guns, not enough to go around the good guys and the bad guys. Battle scenes are poorly coordinated and false like hell. You must remove the pin / spoon from a grenade to explode on its own. You can not fire a missile of any kind when you are inside a helicopter. The weapons you throw do not reappear suddenly. When a rifle is out of bullets, throwing it is still stupid enough. Unless you do not know how to recharge them. Large, slow trucks that roll in first gear create delicate action scenes. I really can not believe that movies like this are really produced. This film would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
