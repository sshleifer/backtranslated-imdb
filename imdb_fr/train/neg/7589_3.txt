What are you waiting for when there is no script to start, and therefore nothing with which the director can work? Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just do not have anything to say or react to. Even the earthquake was poor enough. And I do not know how much the film follows the novel, but two invited the Jewish girl out of nowhere, showing that Arturo has a warm and warm heart, but some stereotypes are worthless. And he even buries Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing her back to LA for a beautiful Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers from time to time. Pathetic. And the whole L.A. was created graphically in a ridiculous way. Nothing good? The window of his apartment was real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Since Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, it does not matter.
