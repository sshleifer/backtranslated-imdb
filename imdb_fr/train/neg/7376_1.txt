Steven, what did you do, you reached a new minimum. It's strange since Steven's latest film, Shadman Man, was directed by the same director who made this junk. The shadow man was good it was diabolically bad so bad it was not even funny Steven is barely in the movie and feels like being in a cameo appearance and when he's in the movie he is doubled anyway. As for the action, let's just say that the oz wizard had more action than this basket; there is virtually no action in the film and when it finally arrives, it's boring and depressing to turn out so-called action scenes. Seagal kills almost nobody unlike his films where he finds himself alone with an army, that is to say under siege 1 and 2 and out of the wound. the plot is so confusing with so many holes that it sometimes does not do scenes. what a fury I would have lost 5 pounds on this trash 0 luck out of ten better luck next time
