This could be considered in different ways. This film is bad, it's good or it's just weird. The third probably explains this film best. He has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this game, regardless of quality, average quality or even quality. <br /> <br /> The acting game is what you expect from Ben Stiller. Jack Black has always pleased me, so you know what you'll get from him, but it's not that bad. Christopher Walken is still on the wall. It is always nice to watch, regardless of the quality of the film. Comedy wise it's a bit funny. This means of course that he has his moments (although very little), but that he is a bit overwhelmed here and there, which gives me the impression that the film is just desperate to laugh but of course not in the common sense. <br /> <br /> The staging was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and has not really done a good job here. This movie seemed to have a lot more potential and it did not do much to reach it. This film is very average and does not seem to have required much effort. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously, this means that writing has failed. At best, it's below average. Considering he had his moments, it was not too horrible. It's never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it was not for Christopher Walken and his stupid ridiculous end, I would have given him a lower note. He is still a character in his films. It's a strange movie with strange characters that really do not go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it because it is a very forgettable film.
