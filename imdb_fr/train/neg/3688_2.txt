As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film because it would be successful. But luckily or unfortunately, the film was a failure. After that, he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi. I am looking forward to Shivaji's arrival. <br /> <br /> I read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting because the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who acts, I think, of his heart and not of his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we must appreciate Rajni for his dynamism at his age. <br /> <br /> By all means, I have to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so I wish you good luck Rajni ...... .....
