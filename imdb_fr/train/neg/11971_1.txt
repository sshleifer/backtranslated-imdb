Even if a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you'd better skip it. I watched this one on TV so I did not have to spend money on it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite believable, it becomes more and more incredible at the end. It is highly questionable that an experienced soldier like Lieutenant Waters disobeys direct orders. And even if he would, if the rest of his platoon would do it. They know he is putting them in direct danger and they will certainly die if they follow him, but damn it, he's our lieutenant, do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> Yet, there are some beautiful scenes in this movie. They save somehow a village where the total population is massacred by the rebels. Well, they saved a dozen villagers, the rest were already killed. The strange thing is that they took the trucks that the rebels left behind. They prefer to go on foot. Maybe because the roads are dangerous, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think that's what earned the film the point I gave it. <br /> <br /> What made this movie an insult to the brain and so quite incredible is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being hurt or killed. Only towards the end, they lose some comrades. And only because they have to fight an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that? <br /> <br /> They fight against a large army, kill hundreds and lose only a few. And they have ammunition cartridges and cartridges. Never miss it. Grenades and Claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even a RPG. Where do they find this stuff? Carry it or what? They even had a laptop that shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts for days. Really? Who thinks this shit. <br /> <br /> I suppose that if you completely extinguish your brain and accept the fact that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this film a high rating. Otherwise, skip this one. This saves you time.
