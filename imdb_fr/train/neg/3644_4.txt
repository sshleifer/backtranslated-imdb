This film is quite poor. The game is abyssal and completely forced. Moreover, filming the film in docudrama does not necessarily make it more believable, you can not get away with it so easily, Mr. Dir. Do not let my comments mislead you, however, because I would recommend you to watch this movie, as it sheds some light on psychology or on a non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the highlight of the movie is absolutely nil! There is no other way to say it! It's pure and just does not capture the atmosphere! What is happening does not translate into a sense of hopelessness, panic, fear or fear that one would surely feel in such terrifying circumstances. No, on the contrary, you are speechless "And that ?!" spilling of your tongue, and in no way are you haunted by the actions of these boys. You feel rather embarrassed for another movie that started with potential, but ended up falling flat on the most crucial point. Zero Day indeed .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
