I remember this show on television when I was a child in the early 1990s and there was such anger that children with lewd leotards kung fu over each other and walk in dinosaurs in plastic. It was called Power Rangers. I remember little children beating each other, and shirts and items in the series were banned in many school districts across the country because they taught children to fight to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens have always looked at the Power Rangers in a ridiculous and contemptuous way, and it's not hard to wonder why. The video is ridiculous at best. The colorful costumes of the rangers look like things you would work in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you go into acting, and of course, these haircuts really laughable. All types run with earrings, half wear mules from the 90s. They always wear the same clothes every day and then turn into a leotard with Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> The toys are particularly ridiculous, and was the joke of many talk show hosts late at night. And of course, two of the worst films ever made, and by that I mean that two of the worst films ever made were based on this show, almost all critics destroying both the films and the series on which it was based. <br /> <br /> Power rangers is nothing more than a bad TV medium for a particularly bad toy merchandising. As an adult, I do not look at him affectionately, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s children's shows, fashion and men's earrings.
