Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most talented comedians in cinema. With his hyperactive spontaneity and rubbery face, he can go crazy and we love him for it. He has the ability to do mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura) and turn them into decent comedy outings. Or, in the case of "Liar Liar", make it one of the most hilarious contemporary comedies ever. Carrey was also able to tackle the dramas. He was excellent in both "Man on the Moon" and "The Truman Show". The guy is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Then comes "Bruce Almighty", an ideal vehicle for Carrey and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and the stench of his life, is activated by the powers of God. However, the script is pure recycled waste. Now, no matter how good the script, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes a funny little funny scene. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be released, because so much of the comedy is based on stupid special effects, of which only some are fun. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpowers were fun, because the rest of the movie just filled in, giving Carrey nothing more to work with a crying character who is absolutely devoid of humor. It's more like a five-year desire for our attention, wishing the viewer to find what he's funny about, while it's really boring. <br /> <br /> I always liked Jennifer Aniston in "Friends" and she was great in "The Good Girl" last year. She also has a gift for comedy, but with the scenario as linear as it is, it is simply given the role of the bitter girlfriend. She seems to be grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> "Bruce Almighty" should have been a comedy that works. But he does not even have the courage to tackle the subject he does not care about; religion. A few minor laughs (his internet is Yehweh), but instead, it simply became a comedy superpower comedy. Not to mention that the tone goes from silly comedy to heavy, and sometimes even black. The film fails on almost every level. That does not mean that he's totally without laughter, but it's close. Any film that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog that pisses for laughter has problems. But hey, if you find funny pee jokes, go for it. <br /> <br />
