This film offers nothing new to a genre that has traditionally shown the intercultural love story underpinned by politics in the middle of the 20th century / before the Second World War, where the British and their modern ways are bad and where the Primitive Indians but honest and true good. Certainly, these clich√©d representations of the British are rather outdated now. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that feeds the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the actors play is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the realization is obvious. and without imagination. <br /> <br /> The story needs to be clarified and would certainly have benefited from half an hour of additional projection to give more depth to the characters and narration and give the viewer the necessary investment. . <br /> <br /> Overall, rather uninteresting. Oh and Linus Roache just can not do a tragedy - having your eyes crossed with emotional pain just does not work for me!
