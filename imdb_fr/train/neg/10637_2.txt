I regret buying this series. I was expecting more action, a more objective and coherent image. It's just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm or romanticism, it's just boredom. I find that the actors also work quite weakly. O'Donnell may look charming like Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks charm. Probably as he ages, he loses his childish charm but does not win the charm of an adult. Not surprisingly, it has not been introduced in many countries and is sold in the UK at 40% of the recommended price and has not even been marketed in the Netherlands.
