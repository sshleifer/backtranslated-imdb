It's a strange sexual comedy, because there is very little comedy, but a lot of sex, most of it in the back of a car and so graphic that BASIC INSTINCT looks like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I'm not kidding, the sex in this movie is so terrible that it may choke you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> For the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there is not much else to mention, except the language where each sentence seems to contain the word F. It is a British film hyper Realistic very dark realized at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films, which is why it is designed for low budget television.
