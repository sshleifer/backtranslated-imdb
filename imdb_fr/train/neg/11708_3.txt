I do not know how this film was made. I watched it while working at home, writing e-mails and answering the phone - I only looked at it because I was hoping the "revenge" part would be good. Needless to say, the vengeance and forced twists of intrigue were not worth the emails they were being watched. In fact, I'm not even sure what happened in the end. the acting was as bad as the re-enactment scenarios of the show "FBI Files" - by far, the worst reenactments (in fact, only "arrest and trial" can be as damaging). I did not even know that the main character was in Third Eye Blind until I watched the movie on IMDb, but the reason he did not shoot a movie since then is obvious. I hope he's a good singer.
