After watching this movie, I was so upset that I lost 2 hours of my life. It's been 2 hours that I will never come back. Ugh. When you start this, you might think "Wow, it's really good!" But be assured that first impressions mean nothing. I was so excited about this movie until the stupidest end I've ever seen. This film is simply pathetic. The acting is bland, the screenplay is anything but original and there is nothing particularly unique, except that it's the worst movie of all time !!! DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! WARNING!! THE DUMBEST FILM WILL NEVER BE SORRY IF YOU EAT 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS !!! 1/10
