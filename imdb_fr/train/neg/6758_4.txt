Probably the nicest show business woman and the sexiest, Debbie gives another great performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare is far superior, she still deserves to be seen in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with typical types of Melrose Place, chiseled features and seductive curves that I had never seen before. . Aside from Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I'd ever seen before, in Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered on a group of arrogant Californians who introduced the poor na√Øve Debbie Rochon in their clique. They tell her that they have a murderous club and that she has to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person and the group must now decide what to do with her after she falls in love with their joke. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Abundant!) Debbie Rochon has blood spattered from time to time on her and all scenes of murder unfold in front of your face - Gore dogs will surely benefit!) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Abundant too!) Debbie Rochon has several scenes of nudity, as well as many actresses and actors without name.The party by the pool seems like an excuse to put everyone naked, men and women Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but the character left after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a fill between nude scenes.) I understand that the films B- Spleen often use nudity, but it's excessive, at the limit.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (The acting is less than the norm, the least we can say. still at Reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior.Danny Wolske did a great job as Debbie's lust object, but the other actors did not have nothing to write).
