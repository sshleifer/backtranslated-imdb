Oh my God, Jerry is perhaps the undisputed king of the talk show, but the movies are a completely different game, and he's really coming out of his league. The scenario of this film is so mediocre that it must be believed that it is cruel and that it is sad to see actors as vaguely familiar as Michael Dudikoff (king of the 80s, king of the movie B'movie), Michael Jai White (Last Preview of the movie "Spawn") and William MacNamara (who is involved in the only half-fun situation of the entire movie!) Survive the Games. If you're a fan of Jerry, then stay on his TV show because it's a total loss of an hour and a half. After I sat down, I managed to capture the last half hour of Rocky 5 on television, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think it says more than enough! !! <br /> <br />
