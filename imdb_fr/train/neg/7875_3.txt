The Visitors, the first movie about the temporal travelers of the Middle Ages was really funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course the obvious absurdity, which would remind you a little Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now, this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in large part and the same time travel. The plot changes a bit, as the characters are now supposed to be experienced time travelers. They jump in the story, without paying attention to the fact that it becomes more and more absurd as you go through the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep everything for his game, but his character has been emptied, so he can not do anything to save the film. <br /> <br /> Now, the slave of the duke / help, he really has all the attention. The film is simply about him and his clumsiness / boring / stupid or what he was supposed to be. The fact is; this character tries to make the audience laugh, but he can not. It's as if someone is telling you a very, very bad joke, you already know, but he wants to tell it to the end, adding details, so that your suffering is a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked The Visitors, do not ruin the taste in your mouth with the rest. If you did not like Visitors, you would never want to see what happened next. If you liked this sequel ... well, I guess you still need to see a lot of movies.
