I love the episode where Jim becomes the green man. That's great! When Jim throws this little person out the window, his face is priceless. Then, when he begins to address the priest in favor of his wife to discover that she has become the woman-pee? Excellent writing and casting and excellent acting make it a must. I'm trying to find a picture of this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on a bulletin board because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can upload a photo of Jim as Greenman? Can someone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?
