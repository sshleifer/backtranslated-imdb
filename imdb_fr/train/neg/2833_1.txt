With a film by Bo Derek, the audience gets exactly what they expect. A plot of fine paper and some plans of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "Ghosts can not do it", that's just it. The first fifteen minutes are ordinary television series, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with a lot of experience in many roles, but it seems like a famous actor sometimes has to work only for money. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The film is a total waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad actors, rent a porn movie.
