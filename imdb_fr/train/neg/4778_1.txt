This is the worst show I've seen in years. I think he should be removed from T.V. because of his delay. It's so stupid that I could faint when I look at it. (Even if I never look at him because he's SOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: When Mac says he can not eat sugar, he's eating sugar in another episode. Almost everything in the world contains sugar !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when Eddy screams in Terrance, he falls twice in the box MORE, the time he falls, he does not fall, he falls to the side. What a stupid thing. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with my band about the delay of this show. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
