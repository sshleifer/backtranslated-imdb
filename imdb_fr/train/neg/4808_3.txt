Okay, I saw a lot of movies about witches and occultism, but this one was just weird. This film begins with this witch cult led by a very bad Orson Wells who plays the lead role (they could not have had someone who looked and behaved more like a Satanist) to whom he simply did not belong . Anyway, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that looks like someone and makes it miscarried. The raking woman and her husband went to a place called Lillith, while she sees a picture of her sister or whoever calls her and advises her to stay away and never use her powers. . where she will die. After having settled in the strange city, the couple discovers that all the inhabitants are all sorcerers and she becomes curious and frightened by all her neighbors and friends. Then, strange things begin to happen when the lady discovers that her funeral is on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was scary), as well as to see the boy belonging to Orson Wells on the game board he later asks the lady to help her bring back to live. The lady soon tries to flee the city, but finds herself trapped by her inhabitants and her powers and ignores everything the spirit tries to prevent. This movie is ok, it has its moments of suspense but it could have done much better than having Orson inside.
