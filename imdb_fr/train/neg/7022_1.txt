In over 70 years watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have done some really bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It's not funny from the very beginning, even when shooting in the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, whom I like, probably needed her paycheck. She desperately needs to relearn her job. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not live up to his role either. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find another character, he has already done this kind of person several times. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard who started it many years ago as a leading actor, not as good as before. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent about this cinematic comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Notes: * (of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
