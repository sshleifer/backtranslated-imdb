Raised, trainee, strange and opaque, so visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much male nudity (including incest father-son), and just a kind of vain shamelessness. I will admit, however, that some passages of dialogue, taken in their own way, have a soothing and captivating character.
