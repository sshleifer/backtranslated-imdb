FOREIGN THAT FICTION pissed me off so much that I registered on IMDb to write this comment. FOREIGN THAT FICTION is a surprisingly complex film, touching and stimulating to the very end. Once you've suspended several rationales (why did not Ferrell hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when his fist started writing his book? "The phone rang. the phone rang again, "How could she not know that he's the one calling? Etc.), the film challenges her ideas about mortality, fate, and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain the former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, even if Will Ferrell could just as easily be an ax murderer as a chaotic soul. His quick trust in him is a powerful, great act of faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. Until the end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this film. The film, a metaphor for the journey of life, a tribute to the notion of "true writing", recalling that a great literature is a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, is remarkable. The entire film brings the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's destiny. And no matter how endearing you are, we know very well why we will accept the end. The last act occurs, the screen turns white, the credits roll. A deep and powerful ending for an almost perfect movie. An end that would have been debated for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No credit obtained. Say that is not the case. Say that Hollywood did not use 10 minutes of shit that completely undermined the integrity and the heart of the film. Dustin Hoffman understood well, saying, "It's no longer a masterpiece, it's good." An apt review of the film. Except for me, it was not even OK. I was so annoyed by the betrayal of having "written true", by the decision to flank the film, that I burst into tears, explaining this on the return trip of the film. I do not cry often. I do not care about most movies, but I'm still mad at this one. <br /> <br /> My questions to the author, Zack Helm, are: Did the original film end when the screen went blank? And were you forced, by the weakness of the film's powers, to take advantage of an unfaithful end to the heart of the film? Or did you click on that maudlin ending on yourself? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original script ended the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this criticism and I could not find him any contact. But, please, moviegoers, am I the only one to feel this in the following way: FOREIGN THAT FICTION? A good thing has come to see this movie: I now doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION.
