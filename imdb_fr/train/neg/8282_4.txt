By now, you should already be aware of this film, Jessica Simpson's "bombshell" that is almost directly to the video (limited and anemic theatrical release). Basically, Mrs. Simpson, Katie, comes from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, surprise him, and find him in bed with another woman. She's stuck, but has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I'd like to see more often in a movie), who lets her stay. Katie ends up finding a job through two fellow accomplices (Penelope Ann Miller and Andy Dick, still fun) who just use Katie to dismiss the company's president (Larry Miller). This is strictly a movie b, it's not supposed to be deep. Jessica Simpson is certainly not a great actress, but she is very beautiful and never really boring. The film is viewable in the sense that it is not an abomination, but its down to throw. In a monochrome, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me laugh), and there is a funny scene featuring Norwegian priests (do not read too much in this subject). So, not horrible, but easy to jump. Your sure bet is to watch it on TV if that happens. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
