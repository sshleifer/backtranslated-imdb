What pleased in this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> Underwater photography is awesome! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well sometimes! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is accelerated! Especially when the shark or the bad guys are about to move in! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's slowed down! As to convey to the public, now is the time to show sympathy! <br /> <br /> Like another bites the dust! As in a "western spagetti", it looks a lot like! <br /> <br /> It's not that Italians can not produce quality productions! There was a series of TV movies with a title like "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on Mafia type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you will not find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was done around the 1960s! Sadly, it's been 20 years since time passed, as evidenced by a funeral scene towards the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the sharp bite of the fast shark that creates a red dust in the bluish waters! <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this, whether in a bar fight or watching the last bloody demolition at the seaside by the fierce shark, the companion of the hero looks through his glasses little anxious, as if he, too, was bored in his incessant role in the midst of a lack of proof of the intrigue or the development of anyone's character! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a late fleeting concern, for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our awareness, we have the sinister sound in the voice of the wicked, as if to encourage us to think that another dark action is about to be born! <br /> <br /> And towards the end, someone thought of a turning point! Just when we thought everything was totally predictable! But stay tuned, because you may find another twist! If you watch closely! For, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and drink some beers on the way! This will make your vision of "Shark Night" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a movie "007" that will allow you to come back into reality once it's over !!!
