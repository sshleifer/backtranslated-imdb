I remember this movie when I was 13 (a lot of critics say the same thing, AGE 13!) With a group of school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film and we fell under the spell of typical commercial commercials telling us it was a great comedy. We suffered for about 45 minutes and we all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from Billy Crystal's ability to make us laugh, we do not laugh. I stumbled upon this criticism, and decided to sign up to tell the rest of the world how it was a mess of rotten film. Now, if you rent this, you deserve what you get, YOU ARE WARNED!
