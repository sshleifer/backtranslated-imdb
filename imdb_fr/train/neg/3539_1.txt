Ritchie's first two films were lively and elegant entertainment. Here, he attacks two recent classics ?? "The usual suspects" and "Fight Club" ?? and always goes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite presenting himself as a mystery (with the jostling of the Sub-'Usual Suspects "), the biggest con that he ever had was to convince you that he was yourself "or anyway ...) and trying to change the" Fight Club "about real characters and internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain its interest in its second half. Before the last third, you know that you are led into a dead end and that you venture there slowly. <br /> <br /> The drawbacks, the theory of chess and games are excellent subjects, but Ritchie immerses himself too superficially and too repetitively to use the material a lot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the film (almost) visible is Ritchie's bold way with a scene and the dynamic camera of Maurice-Jones. If Ritchie sticked to a more satisfying plot and a tighter edition, he would have no reason why he could not have created another nice gangster hug. <br /> <br /> The revolver is a waste of time. Incomprehensibility does not equate to depth. If you want to see a big movie that does not make sense but takes advantage of it (and incidentally also implies an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement), look at 'Lost Highway'.
