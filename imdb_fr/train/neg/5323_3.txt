I can not believe that in the 34 previous comments, no one mentioned that this movie is a flagrant scam of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring a seemingly dumb blonde to the demands of a gangster. The engaged pistol and the blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. The gangster is left behind. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment, while it is a lot of down. The transfer of Technicolor on DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would turn in her grave. Check out the newspaper delivery guy. Recognize it? But, it is historically interesting to see the roots of rock 'n roll. Also interesting is the introduction by Ewell of CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
