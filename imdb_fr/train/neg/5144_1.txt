The orange tone at all was just disgusting. Oh yes, the main character lives in a ghetto with orange shades. Meanwhile, to mentally escape this miserable physical poverty, she plays a video game in total immersion (where no rule is clear and no logic follows the gameplay). Apparently, she earns income by playing the game, but she turns out not to be an employee of the gaming company? Many unreported breaks later, the story slowly crawls. It uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface so visually boring and I can only think of a future version of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I ask the viewer why she is wasting her precious time at a moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life? Oh yes, it's fun to play games, but what's the use when you're almost hungry? As she spends her life playing an unhealthy total immersion video game even more tinged with orange, her dog runs away (probably looking for an owner who gives it at least a moment of attention and the regularly feeds) stolen from the woman (while she ignores her ugly reality in orange). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, she is obsessed with some games her gaming team has lost all the movie without interest. Yawning. So she wants to be the best of the best, go get them Ash Catchem (must annoy us all). Hell, this main character is no good as a human being and has no redeeming qualities apart from her physical beauty (which she could trade one way or another to escape her miserable poverty) . <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "Real" and that, at least, does not fear horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate living mentally at the "Real" level.Finally, the film tinged d The sweet and boring orange is no longer a tedious chore to look at, but has the potential to say something like, "the main character is trapped in computer-generated fantasy poverty and she is currently in the real world". Maybe she will do the murder act and live in the real world now? Well, she's killing the guy and he's disappearing into a digital effect ... Hou la la! Thank you silly director. You suck, you suck so much, director. <br /> <br /> Here, the director had a chance to redeem himself a bit by burying this stupid, silly and filthy film with a philosophical touch. <br /> <The director could have said: " TRUE WORLD is here and if you live there and help to improve it, it is not There's no way to turn this film into a devilish crap, an incredibly slow lesson in basic civic pride (for 1% of viewers who did not find it). that you really have to watch or who are masochists of cinema). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to ruin everything by creating a rude digital effect and ruining the chances of redemption for this terribly ugly film that was a waste of money, a waste of time and a loss of confidence of the viewer. <br /> After that, it ends. Good riddance. I hope the director suffocates him. I put this HACK on my list "to avoid at all costs" for all the other films to which his name is associated.
