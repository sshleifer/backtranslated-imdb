It's a fascinating and horrible film. It makes so little sense that it starts to make some strange internal logic of its own. Well, that would be the case if she did not continue to sneak into the side aisles before struggling under the weight of her own indecision. The film does not know if it's a simple film "Man Turns In Monster" (like all those movies from the 1950s "THE INCREDIBLE insert ING MAN"), a horrible film, conspiracy theory , or a mystical film. after-life contact story, or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesquely on the top and pull in all directions, leaving loose ends beating in all directions. It was as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch tablets. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
