I rented and watched this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any comments on it. So, after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed that something was wrong with this movie. it's terrible! I mean, in the trailers, it sounds scary and serious! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (the director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? He should watch and learn better horror comedies such as: "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! These are fun! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason why I signed up for www.IMDb.com to be able to express my dissatisfaction on this subject. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! <and take notes for my partial "exam" to show how stupid the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, where's my car?" (comedy) I can watch again and again and enjoy again! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How can a script and a director be bad ??? It's bad. Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the first scenes, we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog is lying on the floor, his tongue hanging and his gaze impassive. Death! <br /> <br /> The movie does not explain the long-haired blonde who loves to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the wood?") is "nothing". The scenario says that this bearded guy warns them of wood just for "suspense". <br /> <br /> Then the "smarter" of the group of 5, Bert, gives us almost an example of how to trigger a forest fire. . He meets Henry, now infected, who asks for help and, from now on, turns a record using the "F-word". Bert starts to panic because Henry looks terribly sick. Bert: "Do not force me to shoot you!" (He forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert returns to the cabin, but what about? He meets Marcy and Jeff who have had sex, but now decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely extinguishes the unguarded campfire that Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the madman thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another lunatic presents himself with his dog. (Perhaps this is the meaning of the warning about the woods - it's filled with nuts ... and their dogs !?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder they are all DUMB!) This is the last time we see this forgotten character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry shows up at their cabin, NOTE: He was lying all the time a few feet from their cabin !!!) looked worse, almost like a zombie, covered in mud! He says he needs a doctor. But Young Einstein refuse to help the poor sucker. He climbs into their unlocked truck which of course also has his key in touch. Henry seems almost smart enough to chase hell away, but starts sucking blood on the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five arrive running, armed with: a BB gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* eh? You've already tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods ???), a poker and a 'a spray (insecticide?) can, ready to fight single man, unarmed and terribly sick. (smart script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of the director Eli Roth. "What am I supposed to do next?" Bert screams to defend himself. Jeff and Paul try to hit Henry with their bat and their poker but miss and crush the windows of the truck instead. Henry goes to the stupid girls who say, "He comes to us!" (Thanks for the news, dumb, I can see it, but I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy sprays his eyes in his eyes, making Henry scream! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a fiery log from the campfire, which they have imprudently left on fire while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where did all that wisdom go?) I guess cannabis started to wreak havoc :-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs off screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff head for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "seek help" by herself, in the woods, while Paul stays with Karen ... Does not that sound silly? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert "were already looking for help"! <br /> <br /> I will now pass my comments on how we suddenly see Marcy in an CANOE rowing over a huge winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going? Anyway, she goes to the edge of the river and finds a huge shack apparently abandoned and, as in most horror movies, walks around the cabin saying, "Hello? someone? " Bert suddenly appears behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and me at first). And also comes Jeff. How did they come here !? Have they crossed the river ??? Do you see how brainless the script is? <br /> <br /> MP Winston meets Paul at the booth. In a way, he does not notice the blood on their truck. This happens about 35 minutes of viewing and I decided not to torture myself anymore and to release the DVD. (Before I look at my eyes! ... Now it's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this film, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" or "The Return of the Living Dead". Then you will see that they are MORE entertaining than that ... this thing. Even the movie "Toxic Avenger Part 2", which is also a shabby movie, is MUCH more funny than "Cabin Fever".
