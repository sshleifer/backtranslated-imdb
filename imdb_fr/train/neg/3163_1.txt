Well, it's the first message of my life on IMDb. You understand, this film made me come to warn all good souls who will stop experimenting with movies. <br /> Like most of them I thought about watching this movie because it seemed to have decent actors (although having read the most critical critics against this movie), I thought about it experimenting with assuming it's a humorous film., Well, it all started with some ahem., comedies .... so everything started to get pathetic ... dude, you can believe yourself you want to go to the head every time the pathetic woman called the heroine of the film is rendered helpless. ..Huh ~~ Well how much can a person digest a sick person like a POSSESSIVE phantom trying to do all he can to irritate you and prevent you from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about the movie is, the hero "ZOMBIE", yes as he loses his fiance, he wanders like a goat, with black marks under his eyes., and with the "terribly stupid" sister of the hero ... you bleed from head to toe if you try to succeed and you look completely at this movie ~!
