Gung Ho was a good idea, but it is far too much to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this movie, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) travels to Japan and convinces a Japanese automaker to come to America and help his dying town of Pennslyvania. Two things come to your mind. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when it does, and so? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all types are going to third world countries to have their products manufactured in order to escape the cost of the American workforce? The film therefore assumes that the world's leading car manufacturer would go to one of its main competitors (outside of Germany) and install an unrealistic factory there. Keaton was still in his comedy mode at that time. But he gives a credible performance while proving that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and not get bored yet, but director Ron Howard can not stop this from becoming a TV movie that will eventually become anyway because they must give the improbable story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations. The producers of these two series made the film, then the TV version of this film, which gives the film its sensation of lightness. The Japanese manager begins to like his American workers feel that he and other Japanese can learn from Americans. His man No. 2, Saito, who does not like Americans, does not think much about him. I would have preferred all Japanese characters to be like Saito rather than the gogo of the characters they invented as Japanese. It would have made the film more interesting.
