I basically found Eden's Curve very poorly built, which made monitoring difficult. However, there is something I have to say about how the director captured something of the early 70s atmosphere in the choice of sets and clothes. The philosophy of "back to earth" and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that were not dramatically decadent, as described in many subsequent versions of the 1970s, were quite right, as was the nickname "do not ask, do not say". fraternity of East Coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought it was more of a New England school than a Virginia school, where I imagine the mentality the "good old boy" still dominated, even elitist schools like this one. Another thing that I understood well and that I could understand is that it was a time when homosexuality was not so much linked to leatherworkers or drag-queens and I appreciated certain homosexual roles that were not related to these terribly overused images. I found it very unfortunate that the "gay culture" adopted some standard forms in the 1980s, starting with Castro and Christopher Streets, defining the movement and leaving out a considerable number of more sober homosexual men in their lifestyle . I enjoyed the film primarily as a way of recalling a more natural way of our sexuality and personal relationships without "the stage".
