I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as the star of a recent film, not just a role, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took advantage of the appreciation of the film at the university and the only thing I can say that I did not like is that the film was shot in an abandoned part from the city and there was no traffic or lookie. <br /> <br /> I must say that the game leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to watch the movie in a lousy direction and the secondary distribution leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I like Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film visible. Otherwise, I would have rated it as another ugly film. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and useless, but the actors who escaped at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shooting were rather bad. There are some problems in the film (continuity) but they are negligible given the low caliber of the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I enjoyed the film because Arnold Vosloo was there. <br /> <br /> Jackie
