There are pretty landscapes. Writers put simple words in the mouths of actors. With less important actors, this show would be silly. "Art must elevate humanity or it's BS." This is not the case, because the art of all those mentioned is also to arouse humanity and to express the dark side. The main character even says that those who do not drink hide the shadow side. False, he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one-dimensional, without widening his horizons with anything but landscapes. There was no breathing organism in his work or expression of his pain. The artist has only been limited to a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were years of elementary school, banal tricks always giving the most powerful character that the writer wanted. I tried to like after reading all the first wow reviews on here. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I guess the excellent comments come from those related to the movie. I was moved once towards the end. The kid was too passive. The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. Just my opinion but nowhere show for me.
