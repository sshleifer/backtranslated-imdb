Everyone involved (and the public) should look for "The Candidate" to see how good this movie could have been. What happened to South American history? What did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think about their roles as cardboard cutouts? So far, I have loved every performance and / or movie of Gene Hackman. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly badly received. I also loved and defended Richard Gere (and I was vilified for that). But here he did not have "power". He has never been intimidating and occasionally persuasive. Overall, I was very disappointed. I was really expecting a lot more from this director and the cast. If you can not find "The Candidate", look again at "Wag the dog" or even "Bulworth".
