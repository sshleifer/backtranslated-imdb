If I had not been forced to look at it for professional reasons, I could never have gone beyond the first 10 minutes. And even in this case, I admit that I quickly advanced through games. The movie version of '63 was far superior in all respects. Yes, I read that this one is more faithful to the original piece, but what a wise thing for the author to change the script in 1963! It is very long, it drags, the songs that are in this version and not in the movie version are boring and unimaginative. The version of "Kids" in the '63 version was very funny and a real classic of the sarcastic humor of the parents. In this version, the Kim is far too old, Conrad is * absolutely horrible * to see (when someone pulls out his shirt, I close the mouth with disgust ... the director of this version has no idea of what is sexy.). This Conrad does not know how to dance or sing (he can not even stay in harmony) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like this, his career would have been completed before the start. As for the other actors, I did not expect Alexander's butt to collapse while he was dancing and Daly was playing the role of mother. See Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the same role correctly executed by someone who understands the timing of the comic. This TV version is nothing but a total loss of time.
