In fact, it's a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Did not Bug's Life do that? I think it was Disneyworld in this tree, so I say before they use that as a logo. Shrek 3d was also a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should always consider it a movie because it has appeared in a "theater" and you can buy it for a DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flies were. I liked the IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a god job of making a movie out of something that is just an adventure back and forth. I recommend it to families and children.
