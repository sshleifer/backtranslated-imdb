Most students find themselves lost in the bubble of universities, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations take place with their classmates and college teachers. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned student who judges the entire community on the basis of limited contact with a small number of his members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on a small group of individuals presented as representing important groups of the population. As usual, it is the people who shout the most who get the most attention from the media. Apart from his false representation of the community in which the film was shot, the documentary was well done. My only problem is that the feelings and uproar described in the film were attributed to the whole community rather than to the few individuals who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is important to look at such a controversy and raise public awareness. differences between political views, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of a few radicals.
