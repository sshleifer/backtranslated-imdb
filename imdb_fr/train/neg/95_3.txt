You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not want to, a man who inflicts horror after budget at less than enthusiastic receptions. But continue to do it all the same. Even the unconvincing praise that surrounds his Camp Blood films is reluctantly given and I am as guilty of it as anyone. Brad normally manages to add something interesting in the mix, a good idea, a weird character, whatever, but without the funds to take him further than the base level, he relies on the audience to calm him down. and appreciate it. and what it could be. Joe Haggerty plays Ebenezer Jackson in a bouncy and very funny performance, and it is also thanks to Sykes that he can feel that this weird bend will unfold in the frame of the film. Come into a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
