MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst-played movie I've ever seen. First, you discover that the shooter has no bank account or history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. In hell, it is impossible for a person like this to be allowed to be so close to a president without talking about high-level work. In addition, the chief of security of POTHUS would not be so excited that he would start drinking in the clouds if the president was killed. This film was nil. I can not express the extreme that this movie was. Every actor was terrible. Even the girl at the trailer park. I shit on this trash. What a waste of time.
