This is without a doubt the most offensive "girls movie" I've seen in years, if ever. The writing and characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film borders on the parody. Before leaving the theater one hour and five minutes after the start of this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all your problems, the "types of interpreters" are miserable damage, and the musicians can not to be good mothers as they cast their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast and beautiful sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she did not lead a more dominant life, she would end up shivering - "alone!", I felt bad. I can not believe this movie was released in theaters. This is the kind of fare that is expected of these "female" cable channels that I always miss when I surf the channels. I am a woman and I am over 35 years old. So I should be part of the target audience of this movie, but damn, "Evening" misses its target.
