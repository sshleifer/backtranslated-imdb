So I finally saw the movie "My left foot" last night after years spent telling my mom how amazing it was ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but all those who have minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less. <br /> <br /> The fatal mistake in my eyes was to become obsessed with the need to prove the normality of this man; the film chose to show him as a complete and total idiot. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical correlation. Humanity always has the capacity to be reprehensible, and the handicap must not hide that. I simply wish impartial spectators to not forgive aberrant behavior and assume that circumstances make it automatically forgivable. They do not do it. It is normal to intervene, so disabled people act, but they do not do it because they are disabled. they do it because they are unreasonable. A physical disability does not give you the right to play the general public, it's just because someone you love is refusing you. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to do certain things if you are handicapped or capable. -body. Giving someone tacit permission to throw a ball directly on their head for the sole purpose of integrating is one of them. (Yes, I once saved a penalty from the star striker of the school, but I had already belonged at that time.This was not for acceptance.) Engage in a fight in a bar is another. Dreaming of the fact that your father only accompanies you after proving that you are able to jump metaphorically through physical hoops, masochism goes too far. All these things are stupid and suffering through them as a means of demonstrating your courage does not make them less reckless. <br /> <br /> So yes; it's not because you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things that you become a fool ... It's a priority, it's to be a good person; give an inspiring example to people with disabilities should appear at the bottom of the list.
