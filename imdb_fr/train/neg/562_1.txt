I like musicals but as a fan of Dickens, I hate this one. ** LIGHT SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor people of London who come to sing? Fagin and Dodger leave at sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. If I remember correctly, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak like Sykes, only grumbling to indicate his hurt. Worse though, Mark Lester plays Oliver, who is often so embarrassed and passive that you wonder if he's really the main character. His representation is not helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is a girl's voice. They may not have understood that the triple boys are found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Dickens fans who respect each other: stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 film or six-80's adaptation. Avoid this whitewash of a musical.
