Of course, I was watching BG. I liked S1, I liked Season 2, Season 3 was OK and I loved the last one. Yay, there is a spin-off show! I did not know anything, one of my friends told me about it. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What waste! Teenage drama fest. There is no science fiction ... well, almost not. At the end of each episode we can see a Cylon. That's all. Who cares? Have they decided that the target audience for the next show would be women under 18? Annoying religious disturbances that speaks, moans, shits ... and some others. <br /> <br /> It is simply sad to note that there is nothing to watch for the moment. Stargate ruined, BG more ...
