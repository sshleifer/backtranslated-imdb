Was it already presage that Tori had complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and that her new boyfriend (the murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes to make you scream with joy: montages galore, a striptease in a kimono (what is your name when you put on a seductive way, instead of removing them?) And a decisive battle on skis! Give yourself a definite start and end, but you can take a sandwich in the second act when everything happens. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever reach heaven or even out of the snow? Nope.
