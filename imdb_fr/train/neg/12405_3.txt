Shame! I was there, comfortably seated in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, hoping to spend a new evening of entertainment with the Muppets. What did I have? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that says a lot) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they had tried Treasure Island too badly. A short story, like Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave the high jinks of Muppets around him. Here, the need to drag the plot has stopped all the fun. Where are the Muppets going next? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
