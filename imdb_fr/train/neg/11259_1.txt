I gave 1 to this movie. I do not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian cinema, made a film like this, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are without substance, boring and uninteresting. Too long, too boring. The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Let's hope that Scola will radically change her theme and style in her next film.
