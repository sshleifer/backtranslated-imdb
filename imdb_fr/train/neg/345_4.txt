It can not be Mandy Schaffer's latest film. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> The little life that he could have lived, the staging completed.Do not blame the cast, they were OK. Even the younger grower his brother was pretty well done, and he did not even start playing until half of the movie.Please, please put Mandy in other movies! beautiful to bury his career at such a young age., heah .... <br /> <br /> Two specific reviews, in case nobody cares (apparently, this movie did not really like this movie ): first, the way Traci appeared at the right melodramatic moment, in order to see everything she was supposed to see and never seen in return was very annoying Hollywood: stop giving villains the perfect chance at Timing that ends when the climax comes in. It's silly - writing better scripts no longer uses this lame plot feature. If your script is not good enough to stay without it, then do not produce it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Carmen would not have fallen for that wrong round of injury that Traci shot. She had already been fingered. Worst writing / making there. <br /> <br /> I could go further in this film, but mercy forbids it. In fact, I did not hate him as much as others seem to have. It just did not make sense unless it was just a vehicle to show the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and anyone who did not think she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say she was not sexy?!? Either of us needs glasses, and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - though I would like to see her again too ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy will make me more movies? <: - D
