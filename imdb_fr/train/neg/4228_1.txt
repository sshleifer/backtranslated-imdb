I can not believe how bad this trash can be! I want my $ 3.99 back! The words defy the description of this badly done shit! The dubbing does not align with the mouth of the actor. Looks like the movie was shot with a vintage 1970s camcorder. I shot better movies with my cell phone camera. The gore is laughable because of the stupid stupid plot. The acting game is what you would expect if you call all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and you get completely torn apart, then try to play a play in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I was not expecting O'Neil and I love zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this film that it's unassailable. To avoid!
