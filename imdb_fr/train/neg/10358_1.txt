I read the whole book "A fold in time" and then I saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but as the book had 190 pages and the film lasted 2 hours, it seemed really overloaded effects and bad game actors. <br /> <br /> A ride back in time, it's a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must team up to find Meg's father and leave Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really fucking. The acting is awful, the direction is laughable and so far, the situations are not necessary. I was really moved to see the same person as Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and created the film, did an excellent book and a terrible film. The acting game is worse than any live video game. Yes, I must admit that there were cool effects. But seriously, they have all been done in a terrible way and no serial in any way possible. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the movie. I wish I could give him a 0 but unfortunately I can only give him a 1. A half could have been useful.
