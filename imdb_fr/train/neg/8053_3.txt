As a premise, this version of the background of Dead Calm's plot was promising. <br /> <br /> However, director Eric Red's inability to produce a compelling hurricane creates a deluge of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br /> In the end, the viewer is more fascinated by the bizarre weather effects than the desired scenario. Intermittent waves of over-direction of ham fist are equally troublesome. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, doing a "hardwood backwoods" schtick, does his best to save the film. But finally, Undertow squeaks like a pig ... and still has more ham to boot.
