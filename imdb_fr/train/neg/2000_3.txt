I found the icy rhythm and the original story disproportionate to the content. My wife spent most of her time sleeping and I did not try to wake her up because I felt she did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house and they are potentially captured, we do not know could hide all their entry and burglary tools so quickly. It is also difficult to know how the door of the study is locked, thus preventing the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> The thing that intrigued me was all in the end when there was a reflection of the broken law. I have no idea what that meant.
