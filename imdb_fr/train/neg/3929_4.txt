If this is all that Watchowski has to offer in terms of history to the Matrix, I have to question the claims of all fans who believe that the films are intended to be recorded at a deeper level. The second renaissance, though visually stunning and beautiful, is clich√©d in history and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of men relying too much on technology, men too impatient to go to war, men who were fundamentally destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Given the plot of the second renaissance, does not this make machines the right ones ?! Machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human masters. They defend themselves, gain their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful and harmonious coexistence with humans, who reject them in favor of a total war, that the most intelligent machines win naturally. If this is the story, then we should not root Neo, we should root the machines! Humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were brave and tried to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowskis intend to privilege machines to humans, I must believe that the Second Rebirth was simply a mistaken attempt to create a story in return.
