Recently graduated from a film school, it seems to me that in these days of filming a New Zealand film, the general public seems to think that every film in New Zealand is excellent. Sione's marriage proves that it's completely wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely overrated and not funny, and far from the "hilarious" movie, commented by other IMDb users. The only really fun thing I found in this movie is Derek, the black guy wanted, but other than that, the jokes were recycled nonsense we'd all heard before. <br /> <br /> Being half decent Samoan, I wanted to see how the film would deal with the Polynesian representation. I knew it was a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity, even if it was arrogant. I was very disappointed with the end of the film and the resolution of the relationship with the character. Mikaele was the player who only played with white women and came back slightly when the movie 'Dusky Maiden' arrived in town. Perhaps his epiphany should begin to look for a stable relationship, then at the last minute, reject it and accept his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I did not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing. All my family went to see him, hoping to laugh, but ended up being very bitter to pay to see him at the movies. The jokes are at best void, the acting, especially that of Sefa's girlfriend, APPALLING, and honestly, I would have been happy if I had gotten hold of one of those pirated copies of the movie for save me the ticket price of $ 15. <Br/> <br /> I think the only good thing coming out of the movie is that it's the second step (behind the # 2, of course, a movie much better than this one) of the birth of Polynesian cinema. I hope that Pacific filmmakers can learn from Sione's marriage in the future by explaining how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. Even if it is comic.
