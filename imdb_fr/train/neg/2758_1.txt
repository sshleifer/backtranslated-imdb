I give this movie a 1 because there is no negative number in the IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. It was very badly played, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. I even doubt that the Salvation Army can fight as badly as the troops did in this movie. I will not even write intrigue spoilers, because the movie is just not good enough for intrigue spoilers. Writing comments on the plot would be useless. If I had to compare this film, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, although I do not like Reign of Fire either, this movie was at least better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater left before the movie was over. The only reason I did not do it was because I just did not think about doing it. I was hoping for a CGI feast and successful fights, but that's not what happened. The martial arts lasted 30 seconds and consisted of a physical exercise performed during the flashback scene, very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the first tank battles, the troops fired for nothing ...... nothing. Someone forgot to tell the group of animators this film so that the street is completely devoid of villains. I also think that the voice of the villain was doubled by the voice off of Imotep in the films The Mummy. Did he have the same thing that echoed. (Anyone owe royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene, I would say it could be considered a spoiler, but only for the purists, I guess. <br /> <br /> Do not go see him. , do not buy the DVD when it will come out either. You were warned.
