I gave this show (I watched only seven episodes) four stars because most of his jokes / stagings seem to fail. Some are not funny, but some are fun - like a 12-year-old boy. She reminds me of this New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what she has, including the kitchen sink, while praying for some things to stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different. enough, as if it lacked the kind of follow-up that a good comedian needed to succeed. <br /> <br /> The entire business is like an under-treated potato.
