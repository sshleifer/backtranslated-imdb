About three minutes later, I started walking fast, pausing only during nudity (why do bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes, I had finished and hoped to get my money back in the rental store. The people who write these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Go writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get in the car with the bomb activated by the guy's remote control! That's how it's done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to add an insult to injury, the "twist" at the end was so stereotyped that it could have come from any action movie written over the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time - Flee! Run away!
