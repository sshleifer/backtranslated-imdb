The follow-up of "Maniac" by William Lustig conclusively proves that, without the dramatic effects of Tom Savini and the convincing performance of Spinell, "Maniac" would never have become the cult hit of what he was. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with a simple storyline that states everything for you and is predictable at every turn, as well as poor performance by all players. Judging by the feeling of "déjà vu" that this film had given me, Lustig had watched "Death Wish" many times before doing that! (* 1/2)
