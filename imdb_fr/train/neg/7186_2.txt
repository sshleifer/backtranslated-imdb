I'm sorry for all fans, but it's a useless movie. The acting is bad, even in wood, it overestimates the fear factor very early and does not work exactly. I think it was supposed to be a twist at the end, but it ended up being extremely confusing. What is going on? The guy who killed everyone was one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> This is hardly original, and it's not even particularly good as a slasher. And that says something. <br /> <br /> I think the one who made the castings, the one who wrote the script and the one who thought about the concept should be sent away and expelled without mercy. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. If someone puts it on a party, throw the disc out the window and make a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
