Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was an excellent speed skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how could it be that Bill Corcoran made such a bad film about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the real story of Dan Jansen is really amazing! Especially when you watch this movie through the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and other actors skate, their technique, the dimensions of the oval speed skating, everything is wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
