John Pressman (Micheal "I should be called Ditech" Lerner) works as a doctor in a doctor's office. Her mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes her to vex people who think they have been wronged. But it turns out to be a film in a movie, but the lines fade quickly as John goes to a movie theater to kill. Invite a guy who watches the movie to do the same. Lerner is absolutely right in that, but Zelda keeps repeating lines of dialogue. It quickly becomes annoying. But not as boring as the two girls watching the movie in a movie. As a horror movie, it fails, it is too busy trying to be smart, trying to get a message across and forget that a slasher movie has to evoke tension, or at least a jump or two . No, what we have here is the worst type of slasher: that of art-house. <br /> <br /> My note: D +
