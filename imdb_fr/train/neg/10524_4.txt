In fact, I intended to see this film at the theater. In fact, it was complete. In fact, I went to see Solaris, which was in fact the worst movie released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a "street pharmacist" hard and streetwise, panicked when he sees a The kid gets shot, so he decides to clean up and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack leaves town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the film, so if they had not revealed it in the preview, it might have been an interesting twist. But they did it, so that's not the case. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not one interesting thing about this movie; everything is given in the overview. If you've seen a single preview, you've seen the entire movie, so you may want to think hard about filling the gaps. Go to the site, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is no surprise or bounce in the whole movie, apart from the seriousness of the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I hope the head of the soundtrack has been fired. Two times. It's largely what the music would look like if the only songs allowed were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I could break the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as foolish as this one) had less talent and musical skills. <br /> <br /> The acting game is at best mediocre, the scenario is at best a crime against humanity and Denise Richards contains at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was part of The Pest!) Defeats the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
