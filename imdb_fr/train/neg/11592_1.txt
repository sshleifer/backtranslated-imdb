I am still trying to determine if the previous payment was worse than this one, or vice versa. Since it's been almost fifteen years since I saw this film, the fact that I remember it so little augurs well. Maybe it's just because I've only looked at it once or twice, but I doubt it. If there was something interesting to remember about this movie, you can rest assured that I will remember it. <br /> <br /> At the time of the release of this film, the franchise was still in its phase of disappearance; has been attributed to it. It's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations about the basics of the plot. One of these articles was supposed to explain that Freddy was too weak to infuse human dreams, so he decided to take on Alice's upcoming son. So far, so good, but it's the job of the writer or director to explain to the audience. This question should not be left to an independent publication. <br /> <br /> Using the anecdotes given in the third part about Freddy's design, one would expect scenes that would take this joke out of the "horror for infants" category, but alas, that does not matter should not be. This proves the idiocy of the American notation system that such junk as B'harni-esque could get the same note as a truly frightening piece like the original. <br /> <br /> At that time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, according to your point of view, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide you with a competent acting game quotient. Or maybe she just looks competent compared to the rest of the cast. Anyway, since her last role was in something called The Blade of all the new adventures of chastity, I doubt that she really had anything else to do for her. Even poor old Robert Englund had better productions than those of the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Given that box office receipts have been steadily declining, and not just for this franchise, at the time, thought the studios would realize that the sterilization of their movies does not make them any more salable. In fact, this film, like its immediate predecessor, was so sterilized that it not only failed to attract a new audience, but also managed to alienate the target audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this, the fifth part must be rewarded for not having the bright and luminescent feeling that made the fourth part so insulting to watch. <br /> <br /> I gave a fifth on A Nightmare On Elm Street. . In trying to appeal to everyone, or everyone's idea of ​​MPAA, she manages to appeal to no one. Like parts two and four, it could be erased from continuity and no one would notice the difference.
