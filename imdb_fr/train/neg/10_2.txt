This film was very promising and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director and the publishers seriously let it down. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Those who have already edited this film have clearly learned new editing techniques and wanted to splash them throughout the film. There are many fast and "flashy" editions in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but end up being boring. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this film and I was expecting a correct resolution to break the balance but alas no, it left me feeling lost time and the filmmakers had wasted their money.
