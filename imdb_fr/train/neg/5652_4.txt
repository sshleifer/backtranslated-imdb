It's not a bad movie ... but it's the guy your girlfriend makes you watch. The story is not bad ... the hour and a half seems so long. It is difficult for me to put this film away because I really like the idea but it was too long for a story ... too bad. The main character never really seems to change much from beginning to end. I mean going through something that "changes your life" and he can barely smash a smile. I really thought that Mac was really good. His bizarre quirk prevented the film from being a complete disaster. Maybe I do not "understand" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I would like to be informed.
