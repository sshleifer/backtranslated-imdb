The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her reflections on her past. The flashbacks concern a weekend where the young Ann is at the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding, she meets Harris who will affect him all his life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as his true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more "responsible" and has two children. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and works in work, but she does not really know how she is going in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The detail of the period in the movie is great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. you really place in another time and another place. And there are actors of very high quality in the film. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at representing the main character and her fragile mental state at the end of her life. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as a main character when she was young (and she is an exceptional singer). Hugh Dancy gave life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now, let's get away from it, which is sadly everything else. Things are constantly disturbing the story as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. So ... you're supposed to believe that she does not like him more than a friend and that her troubles only bother her. And I thought the whole thing, "he could be gay" was out of place and was useless. <br /> <br /> Next, we have Harris. The character is acting in wood and scary. If it had been another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer right off the bat. It's amazing to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they describe the other guys as lame enough to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why do not Ann and Harris meet? They fall for each other. They spend a good night of sex in the old hut of a dirty gardener, come home to discover the tragic end of Buddy, then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet again A few years later, I could not help wondering why. WHY? The film does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people so I had a hard time apologizing for them. <br /> <br /> The part of the story unfolding in the present is quite boring. The good girl cliche and the bad girl cliche. Nina changes during the movie but I do not know why. I'm not sure what convinced her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the girls connect and coincide with old Ann who dreams of chasing a butterfly. It's really bad and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes", advises Ann. The statement does not sound right with the story. And that does not sound right after watching the film and wanting to not have lost the talent of such good actors.
