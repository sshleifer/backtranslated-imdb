There is a word for this kind of film, and this word is "drivel". It was drivel when it was a VHS rental, and it is now that the satellite retransmission has been launched. <br /> <br /> This could go wrong, because it has 2 names averagely known in Kistofferson and Henriksen, a reasonable soundtrack, and the beautiful scenery of Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He also has a woman with curly hair who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want in a movie, then maybe that will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> But he's still so funny.
