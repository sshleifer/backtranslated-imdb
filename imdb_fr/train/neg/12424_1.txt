If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage talks about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are the best friends in the world. When Billy is filmed in Vietnam, he is unable to fend for himself. Scott takes him inside. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie with more cheerful references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott like to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he's "still sore since last night," among other things. <br /> <br /> Great slogans such as "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut the sh! T" will make you laugh for hours. The native American guys who are supposed to play Mexican gang members are also excellent. As they say, it's "the party right now." Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba. I could go on forever, but watch this movie and laugh at your money. It was so funny that I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
