Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are two excellent actors, who can certainly meet all the challenges of acting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one, to the actors and the public: not to fall asleep during a boring, predictable story devoid of imagination. <br /> <br /> 'Observer Detectives (2007)' does its best to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely misguided and embarrassing to the point of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After a third of the film, nothing can capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and relatives, not to mention what's really going on. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who liked it did it or had to, like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed him an old movie in black and white which she made fun of. 'Observer detectives (2007)' is far from category B, it is between Q & A, like -Questions? and - Answer the questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to annoy the viewer to death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> "Watch Detectives (2007)" was a total waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, please, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100
