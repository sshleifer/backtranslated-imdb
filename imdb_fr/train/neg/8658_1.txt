A lot of the scenes must be cut off. There are many scenes that should have been cut. For example, the scene where hunters mention "I have spiders on my dick", "I love dick", play in the mud scene, or a bar scene where the main craft of dinocrat hunter is a snake charmer. <br /> <How about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to the benefit of a boyfriend who walks as if wearing a woman's panties three times too small . While they were making love, did not they realize they were going next to the little boy who was about to run away and lose his head? Why did they do it in a living room? I mean, his head really rocked. How about the beach scene that is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene in Grant Lake. All these strange scenes could easily be dubbed and presented as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here, in my city, Cineplex cinemas have been advertising for months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I did not watch because I learned later that it's not was visible only 1 or 2 days before its cancellation. The movie was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie watching the preview. It shows Dinocroc's leg that looks like a kid wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and comes and goes like a 2 year old. This could easily pass for baby geniuses. <br /> <br /> If film students want to learn what not to do, it's a real classic basket. Like Diane's boyfriend walking as if he was suffering from advanced syphilis, one might ask what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before drinking beer. When does this happen, who cares about Dinocroc? The man in the panties looked more interesting than the whole movie of Dinocroc. His game was so bad that he replaced Mr. Bean much better. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comic talent in a sci-fi horror movie. Perhaps the worst cast in Hollywood history.
