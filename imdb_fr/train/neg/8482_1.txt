Some of my old friends suggested I watch this movie but I was lucky only recently. Kamal Hans was expecting a lot to see something interesting. What I saw was a bunch of mixed garbage camera angles at high speed. I did not understand what the message was except humiliating Hinduism. I am more like many types of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan was a little evil man for orchestrating this kind of thinking. He could have made a horror movie that shit. He tried to add the kind of Hollywood virus and, God forbid, he did not convert that guy into a mutant and eventually get into world domination. It's a well-deserved film for a film school compared to an ordinary audience. Shame on him for not keeping the talent he has. Beginning with the story, Chaos borrowed ideas to the effect butterfly, then between two small religious harmonies at the price of insulting Hinduism (Again, I insult Hinduism more, but this film does not has no equal and my insult is the same for religion in general that could have this movie an intellectual.)
