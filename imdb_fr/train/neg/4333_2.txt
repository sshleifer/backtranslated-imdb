Quote: Theurgist: Anyone with a I.Q. more than 50 years would have seen this film as it is, a smart prequel and well played in a modern classic, yes, it does not have a cast of blockbusters nor a huge budget BUT it is still very well done and me has hung for the duration. <br /> <br /> An IQ over 50, you say .. that most mean you have a I.Q. less than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Get up to power !!! which means that he should have something with the first to do .. <br /> <br /> everything and all his a movie OK so .. YOU CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO CHARACTERS NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps do not comment on a movie if you do not know anything about cinema. but I suppose a I.Q. Under 50, you will not know what the hell I scream ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
