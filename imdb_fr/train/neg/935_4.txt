The users who rated this movie so high just did not see enough good movies to compare it. Have they all been brainwashed? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a movie, and that's partly due to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BU is just a hunting movie. We pick it up at the end of a chase and go straight to another one. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a model emerge? There is almost no time wasted on plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the other two Bourne movies, you are rather lost. If you only - you expect to be lost - a place very far from the cinema. <br /> <br /> The impartial style of Paul Greengrass has worked exceptionally well in United 93, which was a desperate overload of feelings, but in Bourne and his endless troubles simply have the effect of preventing the public from getting involved in the character. He is running. He jumps. He hits. He blew himself up. It erases tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all, he survives. He survives as a man of plastic action survives, which only makes the cascades ridiculous that he pulls all the more soft and devoid of any tension. So, he's leaving a building? So what? He will survive. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There's a girl in the mix because Bourne's love interest died out in a previous incarnation, but it's just a set. I saw more depth of character and catchy dialogue in the episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of self-discovery in the literal sense of the term is dull and formless and does not tell us anything about what we did not know about the first film. It has been turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He discovers his true identity. So what? There is no emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> The end "twist" is telegraphed and weak. Oh, honey, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! I already reduced my score to 4 when writing this comment! I'd better finish now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I like a good action movie and a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither one nor the other. It's a noisy and tedious series of flashy editions, ridiculous sound effects and cartoons violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that this "shows the way" to the Bond franchise is total shit. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
