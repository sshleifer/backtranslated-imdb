Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, especially that of "Down Argentina Way", but when she had time to deal with this disaster, she had also "shot" and frankly, everything the movie was embarrassing. With Douglas Fairbanks JNr (which was to be pretty desperate), the story was bad, the colors good and the film much too long. Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner tried to stimulate interest, but without success. The score was lamentable, and I must say that no song was memorable in any way ... since I was a Miss Grable fan, I would have loved not to have seen it!
