It was a better than average film, I thought, because it was on the cable. I was expecting something like a cheese melodrama and bad effects that can be found in classics like Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The distribution was well chosen ... I particularly liked Ron Livingston as commander of the SWAT. It's good to see him revisiting the same material with which he was so lucky in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they had been that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, I I'm sure you do, since FX repeats everything 50 times ... takes 2 hours and benefits.
