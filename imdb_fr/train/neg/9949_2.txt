This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite. Not that I expect much likelihood in the movies, but one would think that even the homeless and living in town, Jack Mason, would ask why a group of experienced hunters would hire him as a hunting guide. And on arriving at the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays his role as if he were going to lead these men through woods he had never seen. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? ? <br /> <br /> I guess this movie is based on Richard Connell's new "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago, I showed this film to a class of ninth grade students after reading the story. I reissued the film, eliminating all useless scenes and all the rudeness. It ended up lasting 43 minutes.
