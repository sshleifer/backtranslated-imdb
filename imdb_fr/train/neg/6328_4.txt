Why does this film fall well below the standards? In the end, the answer lies in the poor and humorless scenario. Travolta (rather black, I would say, even with a gigantic mule) and Gross behave very much like two young New Yorkers 'dressed in a slick-dress' but still neglected, eager to open their own disco. Other than that, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It's so boring that it's really not worth knowing what's going on under the climax of the film at any level. Kelly Preston is obviously seduced by sex appeal and sex-rich dance with her future husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is very entertaining to watch as "Bob Smith", a struggling KGB member. Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot had been slightly modified so that the settings did not go from NY to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the film ... Apparently, this film was shot in 1986, ready for release in 1987. I suppose that Paramount was unable to release the film until January 1989 because of the incredible plot. It was reported that they found him "impossible to release". Nevertheless, this $ 6,000,000 film reported an embarrassing $ 163,000 turnover as it only aired BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before going straight to the video. This shows the overall poor quality of this film.
