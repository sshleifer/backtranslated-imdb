So let me start by saying that I saw this film as a good deal. I was really bored one day in 1997 and so I went to the movie rental store. I asked the clerk what was the worst film he had in stock. Without hesitation, he accompanied me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the entire movie. So watch it like I did, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-Awful same. I do not need to go into the details of the plot, read the other comments. Jokes do not make sense. The game was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You can try to look at it like something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not even that funny. To avoid!
