Oh my God, this movie was bad for a variety of reasons. I was expecting to see a very low score for this movie and was a little surprised by the overall score. Sorry, but note this as much as many have done, it's a joke! Once you've gone beyond the one shot gimmick / black and white, which was a good idea, the movie drags on, even with a run time of only 66 minutes. The sequence of credits at the beginning was also annoying! In the van, the guys suffer from a flat tire and change wheels, wow! How fast did the guys go on and hurt Campbell? They did not seem to bother to continue chasing him ... sigh..I am only too happy to have gotten him for free with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
