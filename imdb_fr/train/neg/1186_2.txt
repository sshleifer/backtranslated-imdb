Walerian Borowczyks The Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: some were scandalized, others shocked, others applauded their courage. However, I am absolutely not touched, I am bored and I can not help wondering why the display of incoherent and incoherent images that revolve around a central theme is considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was the film really about? To cultivate sexuality in a woman? I've seen some great movies on this subject, but it's not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person and not just as a narrative means of dreaming (naked) of animals. Where there is no character, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not a teenager, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also called a beast?) Has a very adult attitude towards sexuality, so where is the coherence? Is it a movie about religion? If so, we would need a little more thematic material than a priest without function, without character and without charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Is it bestiality? The metaphorical sensation of the film prohibits any realistic examination of bestiality, especially since the realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. A mythical beast and two priests speak of the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it sex? Is it something? I do not know. I only know that showing a gun does not make a movie a war movie. To treat a subject must mean more than simply displaying one's own associations with the theme. <br /> <br /> Admire the controversy. Do not be frightened by bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and others. I'm not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you may discover that it is a work poorly done, poorly edited, misinterpreted, really badly written (okay, some pictures are quite pretty and the main character is a very beautiful girl) The cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks that turning around the pot in a slow and hypnotic way will make a story intelligent. It's not. This makes it boring.
