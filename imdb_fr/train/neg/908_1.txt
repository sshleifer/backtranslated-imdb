After buying the DVD in a good shopping trash because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I inserted it in the DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menus and lots of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself, what a disappointment. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the film here at IMDB actually comes from the people who made the film. So, do not believe it unless you like to waste your money!
