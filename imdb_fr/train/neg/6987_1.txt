I am totally for the idea of ​​a great epic of the American war of independence. It's not that. (And by the way, the Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT either, but I'm moving away from the subject.) <br /> <br /> I saw this film during a projection in the old studios MGM (now Sony) came out of. The public was expecting a lot from this expensive period piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, led by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of the glory of CHARIOTS OF FIRE) and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it did not take long for people to start squirming in their place, whispering ridiculous comments about Pacino's horribly ill-conceived accent - he was supposed to be an American frontier Scottish ancestry (!) - and that of Nastassja Kinski, who was to emigrate recently England (!!). Then the story started and everything collapsed quickly. <br /> <br /> The motivations were confused, the dialogue was atrocious, the events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot advanced on an absurd coincidence; on the second or third time that Pacino and Kinski, two alleged lovers, met, it became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland had a disconcerting performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was everywhere on the map. I guess there were no English actors available. <br /> <br /> There are still a lot of people. Those who remained tried to quell the laughter and then openly sneered. I kept going - I figured that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. Unexplainably, Hudson chose to film them with portable cameras, not even Steadicam, this saccade giving an "authenticity" of misguided newsreel that ruined the sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was a semi-famous television reviewer public a few rows in front of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was pissed off by the behavior of all of us. And of course, in his televised part of the next day, he awarded the film a "10" on his famous "Franklin Scale of 1 to 10", while fervently evoking the thugs who disrupted the projection the night before, which no 'clearly' did not know art when they saw it. What a buffoon. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino did not play in another film for nearly 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never resumed. You can not say that I did not warn you.
