Now, do not get me wrong, I like Christmas movies. I love his wonderful life and I really appreciate the versions of a Christmas carol with George c. Scott and Alistair sim. but this particular movie is awful. I think the singing of life that I love the ghost of the Christmas gift sings is particularly painful. Albert Finney sings pretty well in the year. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it looks like someone is trying to sing through a sip of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was to cut the sound and watch the dance numbers with the South Park Christmas CD.
