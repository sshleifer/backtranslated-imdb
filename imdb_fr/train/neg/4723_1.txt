First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> All those in the former Yugoslavia who are not extremist extremists will agree with me. This film shows the Serb part and only the Serb part. No Serbian crime was represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by Serbs. So there is no neutrality. All "professionals" interviewed are not professionals at all. A guy only reads one book written by a Serbian radical, the other is genocide, and so on. etc. <br /> <br /> Even Slovenes were accused in this film.And the war in Slovenia lasted a few days and only because the Slovenes were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia and YNA could not reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the beginning of the Croatia-Serbia war). Every Slovenian is scandalized by all the accusations of this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croat will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Maybe all major conflicts could be avoided. However, to mention the Second World War and some unrelated things was a really pathetic attempt to justify everything. Just imagine that the Japanese are launching nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington, saying that this was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence concerning the strangled soldier of the YNA and the killing of Serb civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with a journalist claiming that his claims about Serb civilians near Vukovar were lies. Everywhere on the internet. And the director forgot to mention all the bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on the Serbian and Montenegrin side and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins). And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. At first it was just a resistance movement. The director forgot to mention the collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustache, the ethnic cleansing and the fight against the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but all of this can be easily checked. There are many deceptive things in this movie. Only a few of the charges are true. All Croats are outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I do not think I need mention the denial of the Srebrenica genocide, the genocide that contains too much evidence. Imagine the film on Holocaust denial. This film is the same. And according to this film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo also bombed. All Bosnian Muslims are outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> The director forgot to mention the short occupation of the small piece of Macedonian land (FYROM) by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and you really start to believe certain things in this film, know that the Serbs have some sort of propaganda that the Croats, the Bosnian Muslims and the Macedonians are actually Serbs who built their homes. history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this film is a "little" extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very satisfied with this film (about 40% of Serbs vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my arguments. In this so-called documentary, there is very little truth and my advice to all is: find out before you watch this movie. After that, you will only laugh at all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> Watch real and neutral documentaries about the death of Yugoslavia.
