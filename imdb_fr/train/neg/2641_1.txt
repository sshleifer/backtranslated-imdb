Almost all the details of the plot in this film are illogical and improbable. It does not look like a real human story, dead and monotonous. It's a parody of Hollywood, with trumpet tracks that remind you of a Denzel Washington movie, unstable shots, racist stereotypes, absolutely useless and comical shots, and gestures of famous people in the catalog poses clothing. It is designed to meet the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life stems from the observation of celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the ending credits and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot to watch this, save yourself.
