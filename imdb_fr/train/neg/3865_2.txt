It's incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say they are really trying hard to polish a poop, but we all know you can not. The writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see them trying to sell it. The humor and the rhythm are so painful that it is hard to believe that one of these good actors is committed to that. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so terrible that we have trouble looking away from the screen. We just need to know where this sinking is going. But it's only because we saw it on television. If we had actually paid for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> This gives 2 stars at least to be funny / fascinating. And the incidental music (as opposed to the independent soundtrack too hard) is a playful reminder of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
