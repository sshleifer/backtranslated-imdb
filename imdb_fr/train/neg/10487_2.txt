OMG! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from that, how did this decent mid-stream distribution decide to make such a lame film? It was perhaps a good idea at the time ... There is nothing to laugh, the stereotypes are pathetic, the casting is lost, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, the blame comes largely from director Joel Zwick. It only brings flat performance from everyone involved. Do not waste your time as I did; but then, I enjoy a good train wreck. Damn, now the system tells me I need more lines - that's it: this movie should be called Back to Sender. Ok, now THAT was funnier than anything in the movie ...
