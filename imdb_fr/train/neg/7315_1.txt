OK, let's get straight to the point. We have five recent college graduates (who had to specialize in the word F) who go camping on weekends. They meet someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to burn him down. Beautiful group of people. Then some of them begin to get sick - there must be something in the water at the cabin where they are staying. However, the neighbors seem to be well. Well, when things start to spoil, they lock up one of their companions instead of asking for help (try the neighbor by the way). Some people do not like them. They chase one at high speed in the woods for several kilometers, until the truck breaks down. Ten minutes later, he comes to the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin realizes something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to let this happen. He then decides the next day to return to the hut thinking that it must be a sanctuary. He is stunned to know that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour virus). Unfortunately, he is met by not very friendly policemen. Another couple decides to make love while the creature eats its flesh, then the women realize that they have to shave their legs (taking a lot of sick skin with shaving cream). Anyway, you have the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I was looking for flesh-eating bacteria. Other characters were presented, which were also amusing but quite improbable. Ninety minutes of good life ruined here.
