Oh what a condescending movie! Located in Los Angeles, the center of the world of Hollywood directors in POV, this film tries to make a deep social comment on contemporary American anxiety. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped and smoky characters from a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds meet each other in their daily lives, their mundane lives. The plot is disjointed and disjointed. Numerous unimaginative plots push the film forward, such as: a shootout, an abandoned baby left in the grass, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying in the night sky over the city, a child in summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the only constant is the generous help of the sociological "information" transmitted by the dialogue, while the characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character says to another: "When you sit on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize how much we are joking ... ... these rocks make fun of me, I could say, me and my worries, really humorous for this Grand Canyon ". <br /> <br /> And another character will pontificate on the meaning of all this: "There is a chasm in this country, an ever greater chasm between the people who have 'have ... it is as if that big hole had opened in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what's pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the horribly artificial and forced dialogue, apart from the shallow and scary characters, apart from the silent plot, the narrative is extremely slow. To act is uninspired and superficial. The tone of the film is enough and satisfied, in the contempt of the script for the viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a movie project endorsed by Hollywood costumes who pretend to be all-powerful gurus and watch them from above. They think that their film will be a surprising revelation for us, modest and ignorant spectators, eager to understand the true meaning of American social change.
