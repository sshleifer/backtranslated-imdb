it's probably the worst and silliest room I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is that a guy goes crazy and dresses as Santa Claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give oral sex to his father while he was dressed like Santa Claus. WHY HE BECAME INSANE? Is it just me or is it the worst reason for someone to go crazy like never before? and that's not the only thing. I'm serious when I say nothing happens in this shitty movie. There is only 1 hour and 15 minutes left. <br /> <br /> There is a whole friggin scene where he sticks a friggin beard to Santa Claus. THIS IS A LONG MINUTE FRIGGIN. Who the hell wants to see that? However, I must say that the end of this film has made me shit. So, if you see this film on television or if something comes back in about an hour and twenty minutes, you will definitely see the worst end of all film history. and I am serious about it. <br /> <br /> It's not even so good that it's bad, it's boring, it's silly, it made me want to break the VCR. it's just not worth your time. I'm sure all the other reviews have mentioned it, but the actress who played the mother for Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT TIME THIS FILM? I'LL BE BETTER LOOKING AT THE ENHANCED HOST FOR SIXTY SIX HOURS, THEN EVEN LOOKING AT THIS COVERAGE OF MOVIES.
