Watching Josh Kornbluth 'act' in this film reminds me of my first year TV production class, where the 'not funny' got the chance to prove how crazy they really were! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that comes that makes me think when I try to synthesize this comedy. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painfully bad. OUCH!!!!!!! The writing is simply dorkish. It sounds like a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a Saturday Night Live skit (post Belushi) that lasts an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I wanted to get my money back !!!
