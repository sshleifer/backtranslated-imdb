This movie has had some andr√©naline kickers, but it's an old story that just could not happen. Navy protocols could never break as much as a crew and even less an XO could not go so far against the captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
