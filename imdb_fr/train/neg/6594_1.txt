I have seen most, if not all, of Laurel & Hardy's classic films. I have always enjoyed it stupidly, even after watching it again and again. This new film tries to bring back the classic with two new actors who look like Laurel & Hardy, but fails miserably for various reasons. One of the problems is that their clothes are still out of place (at the beginning of the 20th century), but they are both described in the '90s scenery. Some of the previous dialogues have been brought back, but they are also failing. lamentably in the classic series. This film could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen and should be removed from the market and locked up forever. The real Laurel & Hardy turn in their grave to such bad imitation.
