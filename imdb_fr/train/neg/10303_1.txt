*** The comments contain spoilers *** I barely had this show as a TV appointment when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps averaged shots per case, while Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we should not notice it) and when Colby was a TRIPLE agent. But now, in the episode tonight, David is trapped with a paranoid job that is a scary amateur with a rifle, in an elevator and ... HE CAN NOT DISARM. Qualified and experienced field agent, who has often passed the first control of the door and is experienced in melee combat, CAN NOT TAKE WORK OF NUTS. Not when the job blinks, looks away, lowers its head, closes its eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire that wiggles around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came and let me know that I enjoy learning so much from Charles Epps, chubby, frumpy but very charming, and his sexy / amorous sidekick Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise . Don gives David the "word of distress" which is the code for "The s ** t is about to fall"; David is ready, they kill the lights, let go of the elevator, erase the nuts work and ... David can not disarm / kill / battery to submit the work of the nuts. The villain ends up with BOTH GUNS, David is photographed. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope the NUMB3RS are fun.
