I am Catholic, taught in parish elementary schools by nuns, by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but I would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe in certain things and I do not act in certain ways just because the church said it. <br /> <br /> to the film ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire embodying a religious figurehead. There is no comedy in there and the satire is not well done by the alternate role of Diane Keaton. I have never seen the play, but if it was very different from this movie, then maybe that's fine. At first, I imagined that the gun could be a fake and that the first shoot had been planned by the main four alumni to try to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual sectarianism of Sister Mary. But it turns out that the bullets were real and that the story was tragic ... the tragedy resulting in loss of life (apart from the two former students ... the life of aborted babies, the life of the mother of the pupil), the dogmatic tragedy the authority over the love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing the true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, Judaism and yesterday's Christianity.
