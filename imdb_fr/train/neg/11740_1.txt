George Sanders vehicle of a frightful attitude, where he goes from thief to tsar police. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an excellent actor, he was certainly not an important man and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart brought comic relief until a moment of anger led him to use his weapon with tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After such a deplorable film, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual attraction of Signe Hasso is actually nothing like it.
