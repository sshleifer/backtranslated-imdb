It's the biggest piece of lamo I've ever seen. It's extremely boring. I would have preferred to attend a seminar on creationism rather than look at it if I had known it was going to be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the cutie in the bikini with the big your heap buy nothing less than a 1. The critics of this movie claiming that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and just plain wrong. Not a thing is funny in this movie. they spend a good fifty minutes walking in the woods talking about things you would not understand, and it's just as lame that people start dying because you do not even know who they are because they are so UNINTEREST. Honestly, I have not looked at it all the way, but that should say how awful it is. THE WORST VIDEO NEVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after ejecting this dirt from my DVD player, I started rubbing it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other superfluous customers to make the same mistake as me at rent this movie. Then Zach pee in his pants. Thank you for your time.
