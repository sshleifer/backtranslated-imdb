Maaan, where should I start with this awful movie? Bad Bad Bad tell a story. I do not know what the director thought when he made this movie. To be honest, Namaste London was quite a nice movie .. even the soundtrack was good. But in this one..oh my good..for a movie that is supposed to be a musical .. the songs are so bad. AR Rahman should have been the musical director. <br /> <br /> The director should have done a much better job for two big actors. Even if the first half is zero, the last 30 minutes of the movie are OK. The representations of Salman and Ajay avoid that the film is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you have nothing better to do. Dev D and Wake Up Sid are the last good Bollywood movie I've watched (and I'm watching a lot).
