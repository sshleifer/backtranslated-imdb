This is exactly the kind of Saturday drama I loved during the Second World War. I was less than ten years old. And this is the audience for which this soap opera is designed. Looking at him now, you have to roar because of his incompetence and stupidity. The budget should be almost zero, given the shortcuts and repetitions. The game? Well, these are pictures of the Republic, 1944. They read the lines ... and they probably had one to convince them. <br /> <br /> A star and a half.
