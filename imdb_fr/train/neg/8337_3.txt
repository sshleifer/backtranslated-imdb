Millie is a sap. She marries a rich man named Maitland and they have a child. She then surprises him to deceive and divorce ... but allows him to keep the child she claims to love. In the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to heavy support for spouses and children, but left the guy incredibly easy ... without support ... what a sap! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he also turns out to be a cheater! Wow, is she having trouble choosing men? <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl - doing everything in her power to distract herself from her bad luck. Suddenly, several years pass. Millie's daughter, whom she left early in the film, is now 17, and oddly enough, fashion has not changed at all. An old friend of Millie (yes, that's another evil man!) Now claims to be his daughter's friend, but he has lustful plans on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she will kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X" but a lot, much less focused. Very often, Millie's motives and actions seem to make little sense. And, the movie seems to have a bit of everything thrown in - as long as it confirms the notion that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good.
