This juvenile and sweet movie is exclusively for teenagers in the bodies of old men, eager to relive their teenage years with hormonal problems. How? By burning gasoline and equating a fast and reckless car (or plane) with freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot borrows a lot from the Mister Rogers neighborhood (if it was run by a petroleum conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if He was strongly sedated and lacked style). <br /> <br /> With Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith in the spotlight, this movie unfolds in a world after the gas crisis in which an all-powerful government does not want you to drive your car and burn gasoline. In a way the opposite of the government of Enron-et-Bush, the government that puts pressure on SUVs and seizes oil. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition alone makes the film ludicrous. But wait ... there is more. Although the film is set in the future, we see no signs of future technology, other than the return to bikes, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks exactly like today. Same clothes, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and the date of filming. There are no solar panels, no wind turbines, no concessions to alternate energy. <br /> <br /> The acting game is flat and tasteless. Even scenes that could have been cruel or moving, a movie with friends, an honor, a romance, a horror ... everything falls flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity is missing - jet overflown Burgess Meredith's character changes color and configuration from moment to moment as filmmakers insult our intelligence with unparalleled archive footage. <br /> <br /> The plot is as stupid and half as exciting as an episode of Dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even car movie fans and SF fans should avoid this movie like an old roadkill, unless you like to heckle Exxon executives trying to make a film as empty as the tank. fuel of the hero.
