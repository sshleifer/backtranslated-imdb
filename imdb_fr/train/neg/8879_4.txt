I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics to his credit. He does well here as heavy, but the direction is so bad and the march so tiring, it never departs. The story begins well, but I wonder how he could count on his wife to hang on. Still, he is good and carries things. The knell is double. First, if we spent the time the characters were walking from one room to another or from one part of the house to another, it would take about a third of the movie. Add to that, Robertson's character sitting in bed in the blue light, looking confused, it might add another piece. I agree with those who said half an hour less would have made a pretty decent film, albeit insignificant. The greatest weakness is just a complicated plot that ultimately leaves incredible questions. I do not put spoilers, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can suggest ten hypotheses without sweat. It would have been better if it had remained a ghost story.
