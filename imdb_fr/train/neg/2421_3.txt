with this attempt by the ABC family of blockbuster "cheaper by the dozen", there is an odious amount of nerdy dialogues, shallow intrigues, and returns to cheese. With about two good actors among many, this film was a major disappointment. It's a Hollywood idol of an already bad plot. Then, as they needed a lot of actors, it meant that they would probably be more forgiving. So the acting was not five stars. The plot went pretty fast and the twists were bad and had a horrible timing. The junction of the characters and the "final relations" were also too soft and clich√©s for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
