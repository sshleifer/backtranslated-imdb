This film was just painful to watch ... not the good dramatic way that makes you cringe emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I did quite well this last sentence as and when), but in an absolutely boring way for more than two hours. Now, you may think that I am only an ignorant critic who has no respect for Shakespeare or "the making of artistic films" ... well, you would be wrong on both counts. I love Shakespeare's works, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've watched a lot of "art-and-test" films like Eraserhead and well done, Eraserhead and Fellini , 8 1/2. ..but it was just over two hours of translation lost in Shakespeare, too much nudity (I can understand the artistic nudity in SOME scenes ... but not in all other shots of a movie! IT WAS INTEMPORAL AND SERVED NOTHING FOR HISTORY !!!), and basically just a film too zealous. I was expecting a lot from this movie because it was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare, The Tempest ... but it was just an extreme disappointment. I attributed this film ONLY to three because of the presence of actor Sir John Gielgud (which far surpassed all the non-names of this film) and the combination cinematography / scenery, because many scenes looked like moving paintings ... However, a lot of this movie would have been better just as a painting with a roll of text underneath. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli had been appointed president of the director, it would have been much better. But this is the opinion of a member of the public, many others can enjoy much more than me. That being said, if you do not find that in the video stores nearby (it's not on DVD now), do not try to go too far to find it ... it's really not worth it .
