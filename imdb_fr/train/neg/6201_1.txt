I saw it. It's not "good" but interesting in a discreet way. The boys are rather naturalistic but ................ the final graphic / free collective rape scene is repugnant and -oh oui- the arbitrary insertion of sequences of the Second World War is shocking the way he is trying to compare the actual horror to this misogynistic device. The real atrocity is real, this movie is just awful. However, the film has an aspect that can attract you. But it seems to me that these are the "new clothes of the emperor", but in fact the opposite. The film looks good, but the direction, the story, the content and the final feeling that you draw from it are vague. If a feeling can be empty, that's it.
