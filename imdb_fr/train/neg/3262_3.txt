I had the chance to meet George Pal (and have my DS: TMOB poster autographed) at a convention shortly after it was released and ask him why he chose to do the movie "camp". Before he could answer, two films from the studio intercepted me and explained to me how the studio "knew best" and how "nobody will take such a film seriously". It's been a few years since I was reading Bantam reprints with a friend (the ComiCon participants of the 1970s will remember Blackhawk and his band - I was in a pair of that with him) and I had higher hopes than what we had. . <br /> <br /> The flacks insisted that no great adventure would ever be conducted seriously and that, therefore, the "camp" was the only way. Several other fans have sided with me, with Pal listening to his best. At the end of the small event, Pal came to us and apologized, wishing he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS set fire to the fire and one year after his death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could easily have been the next great film franchise ... without the movies. <br /> <br /> Destroy Doc's memory or story, and the movie would be 6/10 is nothing more than a popcorn seller without brains. <br /> <br /> But destroying such a legacy was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the cradle. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can always come to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons made by the uninformed to Indiana Jones, but it should be done with all the seriousness and seriousness possible to recover the glory that we should expect from the First American superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, there were several simultaneous shots, but mainly shots and very few with actors. And, yes, there's a leaf of Ron Ely jumping over a brick wall and throwing something on his shoulder with a specially constructed bronze gun. Ely wears a feather duster on a white button-down shirt with a bronze tie and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who was the studio that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, hit the idiots on the side of the head and call them idiots they are. At the time, they wore Striped Dorkknobs and Fu Manchu and loose canvas pants and wore Paramount wallets.
