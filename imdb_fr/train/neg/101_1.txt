Amateur, no low-budget movie can be surprisingly good ... but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, the other atrocity of Brad Sykes. The acting is ugly except for Emmy Smith, who looks promising. The "direction" of the camera must be seriously reworked. And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; it does not work. Special effects are not imaginative, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you tear off an ear, please do not let us see the real ear of the actor under the blood. The landscape is bland and boring (as in Mr. Sykes' other projects), and the music is a mix of cheap pornmotel and very bad guitar-driven metal (see commentary on the landscape). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the absence of real plot or development of the character? Apparently, the scriptwriter did not know it. <br /> <br /> Whoever finances this guy ... stop. I have seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not plug in) and they are just as bad. Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not of this type. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but everyone can be a hacker. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn grains would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Reward: The worst military hassle of all time in a movie.
