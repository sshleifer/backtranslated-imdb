This film should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played games, Need For Speed ​​is mainly about hot cars, pretty women and almost no conspiracy. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars. The acting game seemed forced and scripted, the premise was at best fragile and the plot almost non-existent. I only watched this movie to see how bad it was and, even though it was really bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just wish they showed Eddie Griffin crush the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, do not pay for it, do not go looking for it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there is nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
