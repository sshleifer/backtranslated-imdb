... did they bother to make this movie? Anybody? I did not mean it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a film about the transition to adulthood, go rent Summer of '42. It's not the summer of 1942. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard wins more time on the screen, this is your first warning sign And, of course, for such an "artistic" film, there is a lot of curse and skin around, just to make it look "artistic". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his cardboard character uninteresting, usual, punctuated by moments supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of a person with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is best known for his looks and talk about the city of Pittsburgh after filming. Pittsburgh SHOULD keep a grudge against her. She gave a distorted image of a Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the style of the cardboard game. Wow! Was it his first role after the baccalaureate? <br /> <br /> We have this strange triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but is with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed and will not take his boss to bed. So he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller and watches them film him. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller embark on a scene that we are "treated". in every detail sloppy and groaning. Finally, to finish, Foster & Sarsgaard commits with Foster in the role of Miller. Now, I know how 2 guys understand it (as if that's all I needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all, there remains only the tragic end for a character and the retrospective views of the rest 2. That puts me in the hollow of my belly. Oh, wait! It was the pepperoni pizza I had just eaten. <br /> <br /> I would like to go back to the time that this film took in my life, please.
