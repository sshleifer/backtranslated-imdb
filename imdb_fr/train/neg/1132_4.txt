The goal of the very extensive preparatory phase of this Star is Born story seems to be to make the ultimate success all the more sublime. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young inarticulate woman imprisoned in herself but never convincing as a rising-stage theater actress who defeats and benefits from this detachment at the same time. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting, we never see her following the teacher's instructions. After having suffered the horrible details of Esther (she inflicted herself to a great extent), her triumph has not come down to us. . However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never meet in a coherent whole. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to solve his problems. Esther Kahn is still not ready to appear before an audience.
