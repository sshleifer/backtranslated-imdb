With the exception of the FAMILY, this new season is worse than season one. I can not imagine what they think. As a horror fan, can tolerate a lot of gore and thoughtless chaos, but this series worsens with each release. I can not imagine how discouraging it is for actors and the team to get to work every day, striving to produce such shit. STORY! Is it too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we ignore the fate of ANYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares whether they are cut or otherwise? Almost all episodes end in thoughtless blood loss, total shock with no sense of revelation, conclusion or REASON, why we have been bleeding. Even Dante's efforts this season provoked disturbing sexist violence and ended in a useless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performance tend to be at the speed, while the content is total crap. I have high hopes for VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS of Garris, product of Garris, executive producer, but we will see.
