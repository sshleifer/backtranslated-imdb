Horrible movie with pieces of Ramones scattered. Your comedy format is worse than the average of the 1970s / 80s, that is to say, cool children taking over from school with a fanciful plan. This film is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who loves Ramones and a school determined to fight against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining movie B. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the seal of approval of the Ramones who probably needed money quickly so that they said yes to this movie. That's the only logical thing I can think of because this film explodes.
