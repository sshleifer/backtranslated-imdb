I give him four stars out of ten, points or markers, or something like that. <br /> <br /> There have been a total of two really fun scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P, Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) went quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual traffic stereotypes, lightning speed, roughly pushed by a stupid soundtrack, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really fun scenes involve Amy P. She's really hilarious on the part of an animal. It's a mix of this monkey skit they do on SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) confessed that they did it for their money, because by doing that it gave birth to the parodies of Sarah Palin, so I guess we can say, yes, it was worth it to put the black in the role of a servant, who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10, as I said, is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and Half Men" is in this movie, and she underwent some kind of plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30-year-old girl. to rearrange her face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question, "No. Wait, wait, did she have plastic surgery?" As a spectator, you really do not want her to have plastic surgery.
