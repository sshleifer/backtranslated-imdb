This movie did not please me at all. It was obviously a small budget with poor lighting and camera work (almost like Blair Witch Project, except it was not supposed to be that way). There was not really much to the plot, and the movie just drugs again and again. In fact, I made a quick advance in the last third of the films, but it did not help much. It seemed like it could be good of the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie even looked good. No good actors, the special effects were so wrong, the work of the camera was horrible and the dialogue was terribly terrible. Personally, I give this film a 0 out of 10. Yes!
