Presented in Australia under the title "Hydrosphere", this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotized and you have to watch it all the way to see if it could get worse ... and it does! The screenplay is so predictable that it seems written by a high school theater class, the sets are pathetic but slightly better than the miniatures, and the acting is wood. <br /> <br /> The baby "muppet" seems to have been stolen from the 'Total Recall' accessory cupboard. There did not seem to be one original idea in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I found this film so bad that I laughed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should be ashamed of his head. He obviously needed the money!
