Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and wrote his memoirs on scraps of paper, probably the only person ever to have done anything unselfish for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, published almost a century after Panzram's death, describes in the historical context the story of a first-generation American on the runaway. go west and be a cowboy, get caught, throw in the boy's house, go away several times and be thrown into prison again and again, getting tortured and sodomized. As Panzram became huge and powerful, he sought revenge for the wrong he had done on his travels to South America, Europe, and Africa, and no matter who he was raping, stole or murdered, because we are all equally vain. <br /> <br /> This film presents James Woods skinny, rough and mean neck, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who, in the film, is "drunk", excessively dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of to sodomize men and boys. The film does not mention anything else, in particular, about this world traveler and this career prisoner (like the theft of former President Taft or his release from the Oregon Prison as long as he has given his promise to come back). In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.
