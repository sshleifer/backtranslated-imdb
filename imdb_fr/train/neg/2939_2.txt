As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a better title or answer to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to the song ..... not be a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were good - a family film, so to speak - but after that, it's just a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti, in the role of "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice a few times and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time, and so on. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It's Harrold who spoils things and after watching her here, I'm not surprised she did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful landscapes in the film, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and I do not remember much of the second half.
