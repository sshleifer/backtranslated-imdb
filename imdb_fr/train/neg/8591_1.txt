I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chipper would be nicer than sinking. It ends the destruction of what was once a classic couple of movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith, Lucas's career is dead. He wants us to swallow the Annakin is nonsense of Vader? I never thought it was true. This film confirms these feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie was just putting shit until there was only a parade of toys left. I have to go. I know where are some new stones to throw. You want spoilers? Here they are. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is not their father. Count Duke should have changed sides while he could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good for anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found it in the desert and lied to his mother to gather it from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. All this mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on this stupid b *** Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had a brain, she would not have come a year light Annie, but she had told what George Lucas had written to him. What dope!
