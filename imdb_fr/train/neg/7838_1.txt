This film was originally Velvet Goldmine if the writers of the group of five seized it and made a film. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had who was a good actor, wrote, and basically everything else. The film was among the worst writings I've seen since Wild Wild West. It had to be interesting. I know that vh 1 has become a household name for their behind music broadcasts. which are much better than anything that would have worked if it was a musical episode behind but not and feel flat on his face.
