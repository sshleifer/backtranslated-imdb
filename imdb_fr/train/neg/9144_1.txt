This film is really horrible, the candy that embodies Ben can compensate for everything that is wrong in this film. <br /> <br /> The writer / director / producer / main actor, etc. probably had a good idea to create a film about the important issues of same-sex marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate-motivated crimes and almost all the problems that affect a person. homosexual man of that time, little justice to any of these causes. <br /> <br /> The scenario is mediocre, the casting is very ordinary, but the dialogue and the play of the actors are lamentable. The homo-hating brother is played by most actors in the camp and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I saw more passion in a cornflakes advertisement). The acting is rigid and the dialogue forced (a scene where the brother feeds the detective with his lines was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see that the creator of this train wreck did not push all the other garbage to the distribution, and if he thinks about it, I'll have some advice - JUST DO DO NOT do it.
