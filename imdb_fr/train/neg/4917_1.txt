**** WARNING SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take seriously. It would take a major novel to enumerate all the routines of comedy. During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and her company, who often filmed films, gave it a hard-to-imagine twist. Carol played Jenny who suddenly got sick with only a slight cough and immediately the peaceful music was heard and everyone looked around wondering where he was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with fluid wicks and looked almost like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing funnier than this piece is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene in the end. Jenny really seems to be dying ... to die so that her makeup artist can come in and give her some color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to stay in bed with him for the last few moments of the patient. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow, contemplating his future in the film world, is an instant classic. He had something to worry about. He never recovered from that.
