I saw this movie a long time ago and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie talks about Preston Waters, a wealthy pre-teen who always seems to be neglected family and who always seems to run out of money. All this changes when a bank robber passes Preston's bike and gives him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the robber of the bank who gave it). Preston then buys a mansion and says he works as an assistant to a mysterious and rich contributor named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he goes crazy with the money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this seems like a great idea. However, on screen, this is one of the most empty movies I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's too incredible. I know that some parts of the movie were supposed to be incredible, but I trace the thread to a twelve-year-old boy dating with a thirty-year-old woman taking charge of the small fortune of an imaginary. In addition, it was a shallow film with a weak acting game, a predictable plot and characters that are less than memorable. The characters were either corny, exaggerated, boring or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
