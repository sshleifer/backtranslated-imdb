And maybe, as Fred Sandford said, "one on the mouth". It's up to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. And maybe the person from "Rue Morgue" who called it a "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently taking a shortcut at home after a high school football game, get lost and stop to ask directions to a small shop in the middle of nowhere. The driver accidentally hits an parked SUV and turns off a lighthouse, but the girls all decide to leave and do not pick up the driver. But the driver comes to pick them up, and it's not just because the lighthouse of his vehicle has blunted, it's for another reason that the girls do not understand yet. When the driver catches them for the first time, she (yes, she is) brandishes a shotgun and makes them undress, and continues to shout at them, "how much did you see?" Of course, girls are scared to death and do not know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> At dusk, the girls find themselves in a game of cat and mouse with the driver of the SUV, who manages to inflict all sorts of injuries to girls, who are remarkably resistant to the blows of fire and screwdrivers where they do not want. Finally, they discover that something happened in this store after their departure, which explains the psychotic rage of this woman. And finally, they have a chance of revenge and go as far as possible. <br /> <br /> Some elements of this film are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, these moments are undermined by unfair behavior. , poor dialogue and huge lack of credibility. A girl is hit by a gun explosion and seems fatally injured. She's cold, her life is going on under her eyes, but she's getting better? And how far can a minivan ride with a nearly empty petrol tank at a speed of 80 kilometers an hour? I need one of these things, it seems like a lot of mileage. <br /> <br /> There should have been an end when the girls had their revenge, but the film continues a little after that, which is a climax, but at least they learn what triggered the presence of the woman, and the driver is still worried about not spoiling his mother's van, which is obviously the least concern for anyone. <br /> This is the worst film I've seen, but it's too amateurish to be good and yet a little too scary and horrible at the same time to be completely terrible. But it takes the cake for a lot of acute hysteria and you will want to put two on your ears if you look at it. Which, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10
