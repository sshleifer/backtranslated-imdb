This film is a garbage can without originality of homemade. I sometimes like romantic comedies. Watching a good one is like eating an ice cream for dinner. It's not something you'll be doing all the time, but the experience is so nice that you can ignore how imprudent you are. This film made me think how stupid I was to keep sitting all the time. All about screaming done on the cheap. It even looks like they have overexposed the film at times, it is so washed out. It has CGI CG images and lame backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The writing was awkward. I know you can usually expect conspiracy problems in a ball comedy, but you usually do not care about it because you laugh. This movie is so unpleasant that you sit there asking questions about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior. The events were placed in the movie simply to move the characters from one scene to another or to expose them. Of course, that's how all movies work, but you should not notice that it's happening. Inelegant. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There is hardly anyone in the movie who is really friendly. I did not care who ended up with whom, as long as they were all away from me, and I did not need to listen to them anymore. Why would the only really nice character in the movie, Paul Rudd's character, want to have something to do with Eva Longoria's bitchy, condescending and controlled monster? In addition, almost all the characters involved have consistently chosen the most underhanded solution in all situations. A straight man claims to be gay for five years just to go out (and swim with) with a woman who attracts him? The best moment of well-being they could find was to nail on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he met with Rudd's equally annoying and kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive and attract women. Perhaps they will find something better to appear later.
