This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only good thing I can say is that it was so bad that it sounded funny. First, there is no conspiracy. The actors seem to read memory cards and do the stupidest things. Like being chased by people who have died but wanting to go out and find their friends. In addition, the zombies were terrible, not as fun as the works of Romero, who get the film. And the most stupid part of all was that they continued to show flashes of the video game in the action sequences. As if we did not understand, the video game is to photograph zombies. In addition, every 20 years, some know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way people die is so stupid. It's like they're out of ammo, so expect to be attacked. And when they are stuck in front of the house, they are short of ammunition instead of pulling the door, so dumb. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If one of these actors appears in another movie, he was blessed with a second chance. Certainly the worst film I've seen in years. A movie B on cinemax is better.
