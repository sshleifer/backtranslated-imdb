1st seen 27/05/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): Universal's third film about the mummy is about the same as the first two in terms of the final result from the point of view of spectator. The story is similar and the results are impressive. This time, the story is in the United States, as the new disciple of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he can revive it to kill the descendants of those who opened the tomb. This time, the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which does not make much difference, because it does not really ask him to play a lot for this character). The new priest becomes guardian of the morgue in the city and sends the mummy to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the juice of tanna leaves. Again, a girl gets in the way while the priest cracks for the fiance of the descendant and wants her, yes - be immortal with him (have not we heard that before?). The plan is, of course, thwarted as villagers hunt down the mummy with torches (similar to the monster Frankenstein) and the fire of the creature ends the story ... how do they get a sequel ?? I guess you will discover it with the next of the series ?? or not.....
