No, I'm not kidding. If they come up with a movie idea, they have to be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all films and consist only of traveling to foreign countries, having a problem that they easily solve, hoping to be popular and have new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me his name. These "movies" are poor excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There is a reason why movies never go to the theater. I'm sure when they were very young and did OK The movies, some studio heads bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're 17, they can make movies in other countries at any time with studio money. Let me advise you, stay away from Mary-Kate and Ashley! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
