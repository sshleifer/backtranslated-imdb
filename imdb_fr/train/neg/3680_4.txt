I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 to be exact. I was asleep trying to convince myself to get up from bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods south of Jerusalem and I saw a column of smoke rise from a distant point. The sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the sirens sliding. I remember rushing into my room, taking out my binoculars, coming back to the kitchen and seeing the image of a broken glass bus. The bus was still near the boarding station where a terrorist boarded and with a single click on a TNT device, killed 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sitting in the bus in the last row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I'm sure every Israeli has at least one terrorist - memory that he would never have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie at that topic. In reality, the film was about to become a repressed memory. <br /> <br /> The film talks about a play on a dry track, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo He also wrote and directed the film) who spends most of his day at run contests with his blank word processing page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to talk about a former indebted army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a little paranoid because of what is medically called the "what's hot babe out with me" syndrome, asks a private eye to watch over his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective progresses in his investigation, his observations enter the room and later in the lives of his actors. In the meantime, the game is changing from a comic book into an indictment against the isolation of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the film becomes a frenetic editing exercise, embedded in its little cardboard characters and unreliable dialogues while moving away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I speak of "cardboard characters", I refer to characters who, under the obsession of the writer / director for a "significant" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogue and the slightest reliability. I will not say too much about that. Suffice to say, I'm sure homeless men with barefoot homelessness rarely go to the theater. With the intention of seeing a play. <br /> <br /> According to Haim Buzaglo, this film is the first part of a trilogy on the agenda. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from experiences similar to the one I mentioned at the beginning of my review, as opposed to the isolated world of characters that are anything but extant and whose plot is anything but convincing. <Br/> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a landmark in austerity. The filming lasted ten days, all the actors worked for free and the total cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not forget zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You wonder why it took $ 34,000 to carry out the Blair witch project.
