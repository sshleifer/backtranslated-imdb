"Say yes" is one of those movies you hope to improve, but it's never done. This is the kind of 'unmotivated psychopath who decides to threaten the crapfest of an innocent couple, loved by moviegoers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clumsy and, in many places, poorly translated. The acting is consistently mediocre, especially from the villain of the play, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice, he gives the impression that his character is threatening, whereas all that really does is make him look a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special mention. as he is silly beyond belief. The "heroes" do not find it too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The heroine succeeds twice in failing to see the villain when he is only one foot away from her. The perpetrator crosses a police checkpoint (while wearing a blood-covered shirt and a bloody bandage on his head), showing the police a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he drives. The villain is hit, hit with a shovel and stuck with a pitchfork, but never seems to be hindered by these rather serious injuries. And do not even throw me on this terrible "end". Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but nothing but a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a little bit like a poorly copied, flabby and choppy attempt to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos", but that fails every turn because of the lack of talent of all speakers
