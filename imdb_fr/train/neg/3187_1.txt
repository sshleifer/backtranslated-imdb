The star of "MITCHELL", the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are slogans that would normally prevent me from seeing this movie. And the worst is that all the statements mentioned above are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
