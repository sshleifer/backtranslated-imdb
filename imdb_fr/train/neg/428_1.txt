Wow, a movie about New York politics apparently written by someone who has never set foot in New York. You know there is a problem when, at some point, you wait for the credits and the film continues for half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's focus is laughable and the plot oscillates between boring and laughable. A horrible film.
