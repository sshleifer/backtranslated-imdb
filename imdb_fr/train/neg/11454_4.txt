I had little expectations for this film at first, but he did not even manage to satisfy them. Although there have been some funny passages, even one or two bursts of laughter, this movie is terribly below what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and finished very quickly, leaving us sitting there "WTF just arrived?" In addition, there were some jokes that just dragged on again and again. the part where he falls the mountain made me yawn. moreover, the editing was really lacking. There have been some bad scene transitions, but that seems to be the current style. It made me laugh, but I would not look at it anymore, and I'm very glad I waited to rent it. give it a chance, you could enjoy it, but do not think you'd like anything of the virgin kind, or Superbad, 40 years old.
