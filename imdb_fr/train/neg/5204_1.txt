"Trigger Man" is without a doubt the most boring and silly movie I have ever seen in my life. My aunt's vacation videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be recruited on the site uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There are more walks than in the three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man". Awful. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time and money. I would give 0 stars out of 10 to this film, since it is not possible, I must give 1 star.
