Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ..... . . . . . As a rabid fan of Robin Williams, I felt it was necessary to buy this film as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more stupefying film. Essentially, the movie takes a bad joke after another that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and put them on the stage. Robin Williams plays the role of a lawyer in a 30-second sketch. <br /> <br /> I'm all for debauchery humor, but this humor was neither pleasantly vulgar nor talkative ... it was just stultifying. This movie has no quality that buys, aside from the fanatics of Robin Williams, like me, who simply have to own every piece of film.
