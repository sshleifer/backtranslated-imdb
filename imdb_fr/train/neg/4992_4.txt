This movie is just another average action movie, but it could have been so much better. When the rifles came out, they really needed some choreographic help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made this brilliant action sequence in Heat up the street after the robbery - would have turned the dark action scenes into a special event. Because the rest of the movie was correct - predictable but observable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we were waiting for, but that looked like something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot savagely, nothing strikes, and they run around a house. trying to kill each other - the same old, the same old man.
