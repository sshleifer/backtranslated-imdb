The explosion of television channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line, as there must be any moment of a hundred or so Randolph Scott films airing on at least one channel without a budget. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind The Gun" is a typical melodrama of the early 1950s, with pre-World War II production values, based on a mysterious plot of historically topical murder interspersed with action scenes to hide the total lack of development of the character, and therefore suspense. In the years to come, the role of these films would be taken up by TV shows such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", etc. - and they did the job better. Randolph Scott, who seems particularly tired in this case, is the good guy who fights against the bad guys against whom he will eventually win. There's no more interest in what he's experiencing emotionally than what his horse feels, unless you're wondering if he's going to solve the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of "characters" than the actor. But it's okay if it floats your boat; and I will not reprimand you for having appreciated the 'diagnosis, the murder'. <br /> <br /> Worker, pedestrian and aging quickly. 3 stars for having been put in place with competence; 0 for the artistic effort.
