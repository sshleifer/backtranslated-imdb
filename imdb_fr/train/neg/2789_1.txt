Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like home-made video with minimal lighting and horrible acting. Not only the script and the script were miserable. I do not know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of movies in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one boiled my blood. Situations were at best meaningless. If I had made a film like this, it would have been short. Really because those "idjits" of background would not have been present in the photo. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of D.V.D. I am a passionate observer of bad cinema. But this film is almost unassailable. It does not bother me that movies are shot on D.V. but if you do that, make the movie enjoyable, not a movie retreaded from top horror movies (without Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I do not have to recommend this waste of discs. If you come across this one in the rental shop, skip it. <br /> <br /> Movies that really make you angry get a 1 automatically.
