It was in short a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was horribly awkward; I could not feel any feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too quickly and seemed rather out of place. They could just as easily be quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was nonexistent and watching an American Rochester was strange. He could have at least tried to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it simply did not work. I had the impression of looking at Jane Eyre's highlights, where the main elements of the story had been randomly gathered, regardless of the unfolding of the story. The scenery and the music were all very nice, but I could not feel any of the passion and love supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the film left me totally indifferent. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the BBC version of 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now, these two are brilliant adaptations.
