This sad little film hardly resembles the rebirth of Broadway in 1971, which had been so successful "nostalgic". Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove led this recovery, he rewrote the book in depth. I have the impression that this screenwriter has also made as many changes as the original version of 1925. In 1974, I played on Jimmy Smith, the "innocent philanderer," and I thought this 1-dollar DVD would bring back memories. No chance. Even the anticipated pleasure of seeing "Topper" Roland Young play "my" role was a big disappointment. Three songs from the play remain and are very poorly executed. Even the classic duet "Tea For Two" is played in virtual solo. The many familiar faces of this 1940 fiasco are not at all proud, and the star, Anna Neagle, is embarrassed. When I feel gobbled up by spending a dollar, I know the movie must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea for Two" and talks about the play (the original, of course). So, those looking for the real "No No Nanette" might find a more recognizable version there.
