In the first forty minutes, Empire takes shape: it is a powerful, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. At the time, I did not know why, I thought it was good, but now I know it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this film is that it is purely and totally unpleasant. It does not bother me that movies with psychos and things, to prove a point - take Jackie Brown, for example - but they're all terribly superficial in that, but that's obviously for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. The protagonist is another major problem. It's enough, arrogant, but ironically enough, not bad. He does not look tight enough to be a drug killer. In the end, the film is completely pretentious. Not smooth, not smart, just dull and meaningless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * on ***** (1 of 5)
