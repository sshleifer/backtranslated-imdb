What kind of documentary about a musician fails to include a single track of the artist himself ?! Unlike "Ray" or countless other films about musical artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is to relive the great songs themselves. Here, all the tracks are jackets of uninteresting characters, and these renderings fail to capture Cohen's slow and jazzy style. Most often, the covers are poorly sung folk versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures than with Cohen himself. Cohen rarely reads his own work (never sing) - like letters, poems, and so on. The film does not really describe much the life of the artist, nor his development over the years. A huge disappointment for a big fan of Cohen.
