This film is incomprehensibly bad. It begins with several random explosions, then turns into a puppet T-Rex that speaks (!) To the public. There are back and forth between puppets and animation, probably because filmmakers could not afford live actors. I spare you the long, tedious and relentless plot that drags this pitiful film for 85 brutal minutes. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine has found this video very rare in a hobby shop where it sells well. print b-movies, and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it, but it turned out that our intervention was not necessary. This film makes fun of itself better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought that Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was the nicest film out there, but let Japanamation / Lego Cars / Puppets surpass it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It's very rare and worthwhile, lots of good laughs.
