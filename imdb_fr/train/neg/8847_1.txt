This American soap opera, "Knots Landing", has the advantage of being trapped in an elevator. Each episode contained conspiracies such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not very different from the plots of other dramatic series of the period. As for casting, I saw better actors on a cereal box. From the mid-to-late 1990s, the repetitions of "knots" stunk the UK-Gold like a mountain of layers of mold. I regret to have to announce that I had to undergo this because my mother was a big fan of the series and would look at her religiously. Although since then, the covers have been rare and spaced out (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing we can say about 'Knots' is the catchy melody of the saxophone, later used as title music for the sitcom I.T.V, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy, huh?
