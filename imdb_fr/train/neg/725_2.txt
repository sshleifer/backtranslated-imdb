It was a horrible film! Not for the subject, but for delivery. I went there with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal oppression by the police, with no uprisings at the end. The previews and announcements make NO mention of that! Moreover, despite all that they played until Whoopi Goldberg, I remember that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the surveys do not say anything about it! (That's not what you would expect, but it's more than the problem). If I had known how depressing this film would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would have been prepared for it. It was a bait and switch campaign, and I will never see this movie again!
