I now look at the four Bo Derek vehicles headed by her husband, John; Of course, all are pretty terrible, but it's certainly the sinks. Featuring the usual shaky plot, bad script ?? by the director, of course ?? and acting, not to mention the star's free nudity, it's about the loss of her much older husband, Anthony Quinn (she accepts his gunshot suicide saying he's always admired Hemingway !!), but who continues to appear and talk to him. In fact, he wants to return to another, younger body, but only in the very last scene! Derek is adorable as always, and always plays naive (!) ?? especially in the middle of a confused section that is pursued by an assassin in a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but that easily makes up his nadir; moreover, for a large part of its duration, it acts behind a shiny piece of plastic (probably suggesting that it is in a sort of limbo)! His "substitute" is obviously a beautiful stud who has neither talent nor personality. Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in life after death) will also be present. plus a surprising appearance of billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed it on his CV)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his own director of photography on the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and lame) expressions of thanks to the many people who have lent a helping hand, and that the board of directors at the 1990 Razzie Awards!
