**** WARNING: here are spoilers **** Why do I lose my years running away in a hurry by looking at trash like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, a mediocre writing, a worse staging, and we have not even played theater yet. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can plan the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The hero expert fights against stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. An avalanche fires, burying all the heroes who still manage to escape alive despite all sorts of dangers of cliffhanger. The corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive with his winning money. Second avalanche heroically deflected by the adventurous experience of the renegade expert. Harmful henchmen end up having a heart too. A troubled teenager falls into her mother-in-law's arms after being saved by her. Etc, etc, etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little reason to warn spoilers. You could probably understand the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, most of the time, I was not too far from the goal, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Next, we did not discuss factual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentator, although there are usually some features that even exchange a bad movie. you would have trouble finding one in this one. I guess I gave it 2 out of 10 for some beautiful scenery, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since a movie made me moan, but this one certainly did.
