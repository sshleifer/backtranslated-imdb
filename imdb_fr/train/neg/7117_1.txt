At the beginning of the film, a narrator warns us that THE CRANE OF SCREENING is so terrifying that you could die of fear - and if that is the case, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone was scared to death seeing this film, but some of them may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the kind of film that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL tells the story of a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Once installed at home, she is tormented by a spiritual gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks and finally a skull that rolls in the room and makes it scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his ability to do so is the highlight of the film. The plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and even if the cast is correct, the script is awful and the film so uninspired that you will be ready to run screaming. While the process only takes about sixty-eight minutes, everything seems much longer. Add to that a really horrible print quality and you are there. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they are fun to watch. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few screams - but the movie is so drunk that I can not start laughing more than once in a while, and by the time it's all over, you'll be bored. If Peggy Webber had not had a chance to shout, it was the cure for insomnia. Drop. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon review
