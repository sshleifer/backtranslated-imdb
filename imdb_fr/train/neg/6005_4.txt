It is a classic stinker with a large cast named, mostly seniors who had already well past their bedtime and sleep in it. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty depressing movie when you think about it. Stay on the ground and you will face the disease and eventually your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed she could still dance. Too bad the movie does not focus more on that. Maureen Stapleton, haggard, still displays the steps of the ballroom "Queen of the Star Dust", so much simpler than ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> I only hope this film does not encourage seniors to commit suicide at Jim Jones level. How can anyone be foolish enough to like that and say that it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the elders did a wonderful thing at the end, why was the boy encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also leave the ship? After all, he had found his lover again. <br /> <br /> It would have been a good movie if the seniors had managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Lord know who else is gone. The scriptwriters should have taken the script and placed it in this group as well.
