"Hi everyone, I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thing out of space, so why not thaw it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the stupidest thing a scientist could do, and that could be filled with unknown bacteria or viruses from the Earth and could potentially annihilate the human race, but hey, I want to know what that there is in ". "And nobody says it to NASA, they could take it away from us." "Wow, this thing gives off waves!" "Yes, those who are really strong on contact, so do not touch it, but you can cut it to make it open." "Hi my handsome, check my pinches". (Later in the day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Oh, oh, we have to go to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have phones, radios, or intercoms, even though we have here another piece of equipment worth several billion dollars. "I've never seen such an organic technology!" "Yeah, let me take that stick and stab it." "I'm getting out of here, I do not care if I kill 6 billion human beings on Earth, nobody hides anything from me!" "Look, these are the friendly extraterrestrials of" The Abyss "- they want us to come with them." THE END
