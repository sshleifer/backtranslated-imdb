Siskel & Ebert have been great on this show, whether you agree with them or not because of the real conflict generated by their distinct professional opinions. Roeper reduced this show a notch or two because he was not really a movie critic and had substituted snide for a savvy. Now, when Ben Lyons arrives, I feel like watching "Teen News" - you know, this children's news show, animated by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they only had a regular diet of mainstream movies all their lives. The idea that these two lovers of rank have something interesting or important to say about cinema is ridiculous. If they examine a film without a formula, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just find it "confusing". Wait - I think I understand. ABC belongs to Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper were promoting independent films and were just passersby in big budget studio productions - what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the big studio and only tolerate a few indies. Plus, everyone knows what age-group TV advertisers are trying to achieve. Flagrant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternative universe are these guys called movie critics?
