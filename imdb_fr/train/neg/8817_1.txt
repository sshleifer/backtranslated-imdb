No, I have never seen the "Santa Slasher" series, namely "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this one "Christmas Evil". I have heard all about their reputation, or MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.). I was thinking of praising this one because I heard it appearing as a reference in the 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment. <BR/> <br /> Mothers should be against this, but not for the "killer" ooooohhhh of Santa Claus, but for the fact that this movie was bullshit. Boring, long ?? even just 92 minutes, shit. <br /> <br /> A little boy sees Santa coming down a chimney in 1947, making presents, eating treats and, miraculously, floating in the fireplace. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to see Mom and Santa (somehow) take care of it. Apparently, it ruined this kid for the rest of his life, even though the scene was about as hectic as when Ralphie's father had the "Leg Lamp" in "A Christmas Story". He was so disturbed, he went to the attic and thus cut his hand. <br /> <br /> Move fast into the future! Now we are in 1980 and a messy boy is working in a toy factory. We feel that he is a bit off and he tracks both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is nice, blah blah He needs two thirds of the film to finally snap ?? as if it was not planned for the first image. NO FILM should take so much time. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this film was tense, but only because I expected it to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, well, punish "who is naughty" is as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention the end of the WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is upset, his brother is killing, and his solution is to kill.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I did not look at the other "Santa Slashers", but this one was bad. He created a suspense because of the nature of the film and never offered a decent gift.
