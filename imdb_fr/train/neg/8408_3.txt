Wow, it's very unusual in one respect: usually the first movie in a long series of sequels is the best of the group. People are surprised when a suite is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the group, or at least the first six that make up my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the suites several times, but I sat in front of this turkey, thanks to several characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Lots of action with lots of wild animals on display, even if it's just about archive sequences. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippopotamuses, panthers, etc., and you see several tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the movie.) Since this movie was shot there Almost 75 years ago, I can not resist realism because they did not have it in movies so long ago. They do their best to support actors speaking in front of false sets. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. O'Sullivan and he are a beautiful, well-built couple, if he is one of them in those golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and her beginnings in learning the English language. <br /> <br /> BAD - As soon as "Jane Parker" is taken by Tarzan, almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in a hysterical, screaming, screaming scene. after the scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the movie. Fortunately, she calmed down in the aftermath, but not in this movie. The film also does no favor for the image "The Great White Hunter" as C. Aubrey Smith, playing Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt", the safari guide, shoots all the animals to the sight, whether beasts threaten or not. These people are happy, especially Smith. On another note, it's a shame that there is nothing here that explains how Tarzan arrived in the jungle. There is no story about him here or pictures of his childhood. He is right there when Jane and the band arrive at a certain point in Africa.
