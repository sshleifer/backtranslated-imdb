Unlike the two other current television series Endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 against 100), the pace of this series is much too slow for what happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can come out with a slow pace, because games can change pace - or end - at any time. All the actions of the player are risky, the rewards vary enormously and it is difficult for the players to leave with a large sum of money. Suspense is generally used wisely. <br /> <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, is just too slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that nothing extraordinary will happen in the next few minutes. This would greatly help the rhythm of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, then the player chooses a dancer instead of Shat, who wastes time talking about what will happen if the player is wrong when we all know they are right. . Random dance is a filler that really feels like a filler. Too much time is wasted but not enough ... and the fact that players can not choose to leave the game in advance ensures that there will be a lot of time lost. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have no interest in watching Shat shake his thang throat, especially just after I had dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of a game show for life, but even I had a hard time sitting for an hour. This requires major changes or early retirement.
