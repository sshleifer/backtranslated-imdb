I'm not sure of the Hong Kong movies that other critics have seen, but Enter the Eagles is by no means at the top of Hong Kong's stock list. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy to get an acting job in Hong Kong because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with leg fighting than her father), but her acting skills are also below par. In fact, the whole dialogue in English (90% of the movie - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to audio in Mandarin just to spare myself the misery of the poor performance of dialogue and the redundancy of underwater English Of course, there are some decent shots (but nothing we've seen before) and good cinematography, but the nerdy visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth the cost of entry Look at Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez go there. Spectacular, and almost interesting to watch the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, including a shooting at an open-air market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter dressed in black lattice (think MI: 2). I guess someone thought that at least some of the elements in this movie deserved to be stolen.
