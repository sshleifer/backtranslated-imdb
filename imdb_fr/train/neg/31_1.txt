This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunately, officially, Venus does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female turtle, it took away the tragic tale of 4 unique male mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone. The biggest mistake was to cross Power Rangers to join TMNT with a horrible episode. the turtle's voices were FALSE and they all acted in a disorderly manner. They could have done a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> do not bother with this people ... it's a material worthy of the name. the lip was slow and unnatural. they totally ignored the destroyer. the main villain, a lord dragon guy was nerdy. the turtles seemed light with objects hanging from their bodies, what's going on around the raph thigh? the curtains carved plastrons !? <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, acted in the character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid sounds of children's cartoons ... and better writing could have been good.
