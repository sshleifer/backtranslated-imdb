The plot is not so original. If anyone has seen "The Ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. A wealthy family living in Rome on a daily basis is boring and false, everyone asking others what they think of it. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story will end. It's because it's easy to see Muccino's moralistic vision in this film, so even the most difficult parts seem normal. To summarize in the first 2 minutes of the film, this would be enough and the film's objective was already stated. the family has seen from age 30, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality but to be consistent with his thoughts must push more than normal situations. Really good how Muccino has placed the camera in the right place in motion with the bosses and that's the only reason I do not sleep in the cinema even though still in the movie shouts from the beginning. Perhaps it would be good to see the family as it really is and not to blame something. Morante was intense and awesome as usual but unfortunately on a bad movie!
