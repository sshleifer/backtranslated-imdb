I like Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I appreciate 99% of the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of it. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit that this may have something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of the theater laughing at everything ("Oh no, Jamie is hitting a door! HEE HEE HEE! "), But .. It was so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained shooting, and no shooting from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in your face, noisy and boring. <br /> <br /> The villain has tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point he is just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you've seen coming, too many things you've heard before, and too many lines of "hard" ... and I do not mind, that sort of thing, really, as long as There is a bit of originality to it. In fact, almost all the support cast was simply nil. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny, and I found him funny in this movie ... but not enough to be so. me to support everything else. <br /> <br /> This film required less shoot-em-up, fewer awkward shots, more emotion, more feeling and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him a 2.
