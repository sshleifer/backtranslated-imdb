I do not know why they created this version of "Persuasion" when they already had this beautiful mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I guess they wanted to make a long version, but of course they had to delete a lot; alas, what ended up on the floor of the cutting room is all the beautiful wit and humor, leaving a film that is pure melodrama rather than a fun exhibition of the mores and morals of the English countryside . <br /> <br /> The characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had a poor Anne running into the streets after Captain Wentworth as a stupid modern teenager (and if you're a stupid modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: chasing after a man like a horny woman is not cool) . It's something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not that weighted heroine. <br /> <br /> Some said they found this antiquity ridiculous; My reaction was not laughter, but indignation. The very idea of ​​such a corruption of a work of Austen is under contempt. <br /> <br /> It was horrible.
