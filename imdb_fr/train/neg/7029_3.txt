Phantom of the Mall is a movie that best fits the "easily forgotten" category. This is a pretty ugly variant of the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. This is not a bad idea in itself, but the plot and production of this film are far too weak to bring a decent tribute to this story. On the positive side, Gaston Leroux has yet to turn in his grave. It could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> The ghost of the mall contains too many unnecessary flashbacks and far too many boring sequences to make it memorable. In addition, the writers wanted to give too much history to the story. And even if there is a lot of mystery about Eric's character ... the basic plot is ordinary and already seen. *** SPOILERS *** This is a young couple who breaks up brutally because the boy is killed in a fire. The fire was lit at home because he and his parents refused to sell their house to make room for the construction of a huge shopping center. The boy survived the fire and hid in the mall for revenge. Meanwhile, he keeps his daughter who is now working in the mall and tries to forget his loss. **** END OF SPOILERS *** This rather simple - but rather effective - plot thickens under the weight of useless elements and annoying plot theories. Although it's an entertaining horror movie, it's desperately trying to be a smart thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some innovative murders, but they are not enough to satisfy those who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And then, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a little humor !! All production - including distribution - is taken too seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... As for example, it stars Ken Foree !! Fans of horror will certainly recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It's like the horror landmark that has yet to find an equal. Although his role in this film is limited and even completely useless ... it was a pleasure to see him again. Fans of TV movies will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, a beautiful actress and an elegant woman. Pauly Shore is also in the game but I can not stand it ... so my opinion of him may be a little biased. And finally, praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and she has a bit of talent ... pity she never reached the top. In fact, this film is his greatest achievement and it says a lot about his career ...
