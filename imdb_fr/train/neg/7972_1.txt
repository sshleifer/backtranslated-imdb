I love movies B..but go ... it was not worth a note ... The end was stupid ... b / c THERE IS NO REAL END END !!! .. not to mention that it comes to life alone ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ?? Slowly, then they start killing the characters one by one in 15 minutes ... and I will not even start with the thing that kills the one who does not have the head ... and then you can not not even see what Jigsaw does even with its so-called "new puzzle" ... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id watch the paint dry before Id recommend this movie to God who was abandoned otherwise. .. oh and to make even better the other movie totem, you can see the guy throw the only creature in the scene in the basement from the window .. it was funny like hell and probably the only good part to watch this movie wasting
