Once, a big action star from the sky is found in a small town with a problem of drug traffickers and the corpse of a federal agent. Meetings with former co-stars to clean up the city. <br /> <br /> Light, often to the point of becoming tasteless, the comedy "action" usually does not work. Part of the problem is the casting of Chris Klien as a former action hero. he is not mean, but he is really not credible as someone who has been taken for a hard one. As I said, he's not mean, he just misunderstands what he's saying. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is really not funny and that sometimes seems artificial, and the direction that leads to the port of monotony. There is no life in the way things are organized. It's as if the director had a list of shots and went through this list. It's an uninviting movie. And yet, the film sometimes comes to life, like the final show that ends the film. This sequence works, but because the first parts of the film have collapsed, which has exhausted all its power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend the movie. It's worth it if you're a fan of actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
