What a terrible movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from some interesting scenery, the film is mostly occupied by hysterical submariners shouting, crying, sweating and panicking usually in case of a problem. <Br/> <br /> Take it aside with simplistic ideas to make sure the audience always understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek n is nothing more than a joke) and you have a dumb thriller that does not deserve action. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
