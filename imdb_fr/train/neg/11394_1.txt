Oh, for crying aloud, it must have been the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry, the awesome John Cusack was even involved in that stupid, stupid piece of Stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle has delivered what amounts to the same message, albeit on a more subtle and a bit more mature level, Serendipity passes it on with a hammer, then locks it in your psyche for a boring hour and a half. (and it's been an hour and a half of my life that I will never come back, thank you very much !!). It is bad enough that the main characters of this film have the emotional maturity of fourteen (in fact, I know better fourteen ...), with the possible exception of Jeremy Piven, who was quite pleasant . Just the first 15 minutes of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays this boring foolishness to throw any wind sensitivity (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the Rockstar characters were not as dysfunctional as the idiots were in that "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to see protagonists who seem to have no idea what choice to make in their lives and who feel that they are nothing but puppets for destiny and the vagaries of fate. How tiring. I am sure that those who prefer not to embark on the chaotic chaos of making more complex lifestyle choices and to live responsibly with the consequences will probably appreciate this film more. After all, here is a movie where our hero and our heroine live happily only after sowing chaos and misery in the lives of two other people (ie their respective fianc√©es), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
