So what is it? I found the character Nicholson superficial and unfortunately uninteresting. The character of Angelica Huston has exhausted my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty slut not good. It's not that I do not understand. It's not that I do not think that some of the ideas could have led to anything else. It's a film that only contains the idea that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the film proposes. That Nicholson crack for Turner is absurd, but again, he is supposed to be. This does not seem to me to be one.) Funny, or b.) ... even very interesting! It was a waste of time, so do not get carried away by the hype ... it's a waste of time! That said, the opening sequence of the church is very beautiful ...
