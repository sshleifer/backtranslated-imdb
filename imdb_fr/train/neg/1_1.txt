Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This film is a waste of talent, it is really disgusting. The script is amazing. The dialogue is incredible. The character of Jane Fonda is a caricature of herself, not funny. The film travels with turtle steps, is photographed in a misguided way and preaches unbearably. It also plugs all the snapshots of the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supportive role, but then what? <br /> <br /> This new BDIM rule that requires ten lines for each exam is equally annoying. When a movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text for other readers to know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
