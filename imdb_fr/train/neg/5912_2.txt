Having appreciated Mike Myers' previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations of a 1960s parody of obligation were rather high. It became obvious after the first minute that it was an exercise on how to be as childish and not funny as possible. I exchanged after ten minutes. I looked at it the other day a second time to see if I had been unfair the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I can not believe that even a twelve-year-old can find that funny. The dialogue is a disorder, Myers is hard to watch (just like Heather Graham) and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, further aggravates the situation. Aside from the slightly amusing title and psychedelic scenography, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this as the plague, even though many of my friends have taken advantage of it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).
