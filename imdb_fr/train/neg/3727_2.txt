Written and interpreted by sincere enthusiasts, produced by an operating dealer, it's boring and hard to watch. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie of all time, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From the outside_ usually had a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to hardcore ironists and dispensationalists. I am neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me? Watch it for free (although it comes from the mediocre VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links have been added mainly to reach the 10 minimum IMDb lines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
