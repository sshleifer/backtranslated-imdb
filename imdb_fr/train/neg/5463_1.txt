I saw Arthur (the TV series and the books) many years ago and I never really liked the show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I spoil it, but it's in fact what I think.). Many people liked it, but not me. <br /> <br /> The characters of the school seemed to fight all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were nice to each other frequently, but gradually I was tired of Arthur's attitude with respect to everyone and his sister DW (his name was spelled), and DW was a four-year-old sister of Arthur who looked like ADHD (or ADD) who was sometimes demanding (which could explain why Arthur annoyed by who she was, like her imaginary friend and her collection of stuffed animals, etc.), Arthur's friends behaved like teenagers instead of what they were in Arthur's books , and the parents did not care. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
