Why would anyone in the world do this trash movie? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were pretty stupid, but it takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy (maybe all the time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but the screenwriter, which is neither negative nor positive, as he is just as talented as the one who wrote this one. The writing is too dependent on the word f which is used between 200 and 300 times to nausea. The acting is pretty much tied with the last two Bloodbath movies, so of course it's one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look divine. The plot became too complicated for his good, and involved a government experiment that went wrong and zombies produced. Also featured are cryogenically frozen mutant school kids and zombies who know how to travel in time, leading to one of the craziest endings I've ever seen. After the film, he goes to the outputs, which is strange because all this film is an output. Only see it to make fun of you, because if you go with a serious mind, you risk killing yourself. <br /> <br /> My note: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes
