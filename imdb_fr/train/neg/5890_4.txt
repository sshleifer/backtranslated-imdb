This romantic comedy is not so bad. There are fun things happening here and there, and pretty memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The acting is however amateur (except for the banker). While some scenes are very fun, others are just embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story mediocre. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it's worth it to see if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end felt pretty good. Do not expect anything extraordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
