An anemic drama, an unhappy and seemingly hasty affair starring Cher as an unhappy homemaker who befriends the great evil that was hired by her husband to kill her. Chazz Palminteri, the talkative hired, adapted the scenario from his own game, with staggered stagings and a dialogue back and forth that fatigue quickly eye and ear. An air of sadness hangs over the whole project and the director Paul Mazursky can not leave Cher from his perpetual funk (she is apathetic). Despite all the great talents (including Robert De Niro as a producer), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance for the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
