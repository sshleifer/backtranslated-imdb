The finale of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is rather weak. Some elements derail this film. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends much of his time wearing soft sandals. In my opinion, any shoe on Tarzan, whether sandals or boots, sometimes portrays the character, supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, completely distorts the film as a drawn sheet. For me, his character is useless in the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although Weissmuller continues to look good as Tarzan, it is obvious that he was not at his best. Although in his latest Jungle Jim films, his physique has improved somewhat compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> The Octopus Battle is a great idea, but I think it should have been done in a previous film Weissmuller's physical peak. Similarly, the battle, which lasts only 30 seconds, would be much more thrilling if it were fired at 90 seconds or 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle at Tarzan and his companion. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce in the role of Jane and Linda Christian in the name of Mara are nice to watch, but they fail to save this last film of Weissmuller - a disappointing end to a superb character career.
