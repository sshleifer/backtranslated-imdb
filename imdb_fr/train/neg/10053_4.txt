The corpse of a girl is found without any means of identification. When we discover that one leg is longer than the other, we assume that it is the body of the couple's missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, several years later, she receives a call from her daughter! With the help of a former police officer and a journalist, she embarks on a journey to determine if her daughter is really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a plot disaster, moves at an extremely slow pace and is completely scary. Emma Vilarasau, who did a remarkable job as a desperate mother, was greeted. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure it's worth supporting the rest of the movie. Beware of English subtitles from the recent version of R1 - they are not very accurate.
