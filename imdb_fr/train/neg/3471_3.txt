this movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was not seriously trying to act in any way. He has definitely sucked. Nothing in the film was credible. The first problems were in the intro, where the man gives all his interest to the Salvation Army's Father Christmas but that does not show why. And then the grandmother puts her head in the oven - really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - it's not even the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation for Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the house he chose; the family he chose did not elicit any credible response; and people are influenced here and there for no reason (Example: the characters of Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck sled down a steep slope - this is the incident that caused her to fall in love with him suddenly. .) Anyway, there was a funny moment or two, but they were rare in the movie. He badly needs another rewrite (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
