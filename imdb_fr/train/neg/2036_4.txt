The film is about a young man, Michael, who looks after the elderly. One day, he decides to kill some of his clients' family members. About the same time, he decided to model his assassination on the model of the zodiac killer of the 60s. He made contact with the author of a book on the zodiac killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a gun (apparently the only weapon, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, but it is not described as the same weapon.) And he goes out to kill Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting of the actors really drowned out the plot. I thought the "blood" was too fake, the lighting was awful in some places and the dialogue was too standard. The film was shot in video, which is not serious, but the editing of the film only applies to strange scenes of "Plan 9". This is not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something a little more refined, move on.
