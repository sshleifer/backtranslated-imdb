Well, everything has been said about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone has already said what to say. But the fact is that I've seen millions of films and I'm working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The acting is stupid. It's really stupid for the news anchor to express her sadness at the plane crash. The nun is still nice and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main murders in the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid filmmakers can be. Do not they realize that even scams can be scary. We do not see how the grandfather is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserved to die, you can not stand them. And Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been better worked. We just heard her scream and we see nothing!
