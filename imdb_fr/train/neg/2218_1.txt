I admit that my criticism is that of 2006, almost 30 years after the shooting of this film and at the time of its conception, it was perhaps a brilliant horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> From the night of Halloween, in 1968, Michael, 6 years old, commits the brutal murder of his sister, 18 years old. Michael is engaged in a mental institution and 15 years later, he flees and returns to his hometown to be murdered. <br /> <br /> It is now clear that the film will follow a rudimentary and highly predictable trajectory. . The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music of each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the film, alerting the viewer to events that may follow. <br /> <For horror / thriller lovers, there is a serious lack of blood / blood compared to modern movies, although I do not look like the amount displayed nowadays. A happier support could have been found. <br /> <br /> After half an hour of filming, no scene is unexpected. Playing in a horror / thriller movie is quite typical of the time and therefore lacks punch for modern day enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> The positive aspect of the film is its persistence of shots and dark lighting that creates atmosphere. Another positive point would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues to the probability of the story. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the early childhood of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to evaluate this film as it was at the time, but from other horror films / thrillers of truth In the 80s and, in a To a lesser extent, in the 90s, it is far from being a big horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you move on and find a classic 80s. To your health!
