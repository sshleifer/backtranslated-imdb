I have just gone through an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was elevated and set back to the right. The game was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite her best attempts to be dramatic, remains largely unexpressive. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily have played the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotyped role in the plot, mostly random, a sinuous plot. The special effects of cheese can be excused considering the budget of the miniseries of television. But attempts to create suspense and surprise by a distracting cinematography add to the unassailable. I feel that the end was supposed to be spiritual and surprising, but it was nil and had nothing to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its overall quality to anything else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" at the same level as Hercules on NBC.
