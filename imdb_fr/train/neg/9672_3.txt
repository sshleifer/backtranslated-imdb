Although most of the film is very amateurish, the scene of the kosher slaughter is played, but not wrong. The kosher law states that an animal must be aware when the blade touches its skin. The scene of kosher slaughter is exact, as anyone who has seen one or has seen the film Peta showing kosher slaughter, in which the animal is slaughtered and the esophagus cut while still alive, conscious and suffering. We must remember that history is written by the victors. Can one even think that the Nazis might have been right? <br /> <br /> Does not that mean that the Nazis banned religious murder and that Jews still practice it today?
