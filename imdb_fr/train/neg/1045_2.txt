Raising Victor Vargas terribly fails in what he tries most to be: to be real. Unfortunately, this film has no reality. Characters and situations feel completely artificial and wrong. <br /> <br /> The reason? Wrong direction. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett has read somewhere that not lighting up his film would give him an authentic feel. False! It just gives a bad feeling. Likewise, shaking the camera does not confer a documentary style on your movie, it just gives a headache to the audience and harms what's on the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is painfully painful. false, as if Mr. Sollett was writing his script for the sole purpose of trying to look "cool" at his Sundance friends and showing how "pissed off" he was. <br /> <br /> Overall, the only lasting impression This film leaves you with what bad director Mr. Sollett is. Next time, why not take some writing and direction classes?
