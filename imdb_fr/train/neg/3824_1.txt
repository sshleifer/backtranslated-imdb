I think the film does not portray Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" with LDS Church leaders. Historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The film was designed to be an experience of "promoting the faith" and not a balanced vision of Smith "as a man". I took it upon myself to study Smith's life and read the works of LDS and none of LDS's works. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and played well. However, it was not a realistic description of the beginnings of Mormonism nor of Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> An important period of time was given for the reconstruction of an accident that Smith had when he was seven years old. Although this event may have played an important role in shaping his mental vision, it seems that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a comprehensive vision of Joseph Smith. Another point concerns Smith's teen portrayal in the film says nothing about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that while the film shows that Joseph Smith he participates in wrestling in good faith, he does not show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was absolutely not historical and was to be considered as a fiction film about a man. I would not recommend seeing this film for any purpose other than entertainment.
