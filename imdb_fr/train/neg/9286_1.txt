OK, first of all, let me tell you that I'm still amazed at the plot, <br /> <br /> but, again, it's a film starring a Steven Segal film only without Steven Segal Omg !!! <br /> <br /> just random action scenes at low budget really no point i'm always amazed that i burned 90 min on this shit really !! <br /> <br /> just rent a movie from Jacky Chan or go see wwf more fun and do not have and presume not to have and plot !!! plz plz plz avoid that !! In fact, the best actor who plays it is Bill Goldberg and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> and no, he does not play very well, as I said, avoid it pfff. 10 min plus writes this !! :)
