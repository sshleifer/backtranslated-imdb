All the hype! What better way to describe a film about people who are upset because they can not release their film through a mainstream distributor? Therefore, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the hype of the film does not justify the content of the film. The story is missing and could easily be short. The acting is mediocre, but the animation and the music are pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste your time - do not believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to see the movie for free, do it. Then you will not have to waste money. Nevertheless, the filmmakers succeed in reinforcing their story and creating cliffhangers with their complacent mini-series. Otherwise, they are wonders that have never been successful.
