Flipping through the channels late Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as an Amerindian? Seriously?! His accent was so present, even though his character was apparently Scottish. Then, I was stunned to find that this film was shot after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film reproduces the stereotypes with the teacher's inspiring figure. The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this film won a prize? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we wanted to seriously look after watching it for only 10 seconds. We went from "Kicking and Screaming" to that, and we wanted to go back. We watched earlier in the night the children's classic from 1995, "The Indian in the Closet", which also dealt with Iroquois. The next line represents our desire to flee: "Take me outside, grab the earth." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to look."
