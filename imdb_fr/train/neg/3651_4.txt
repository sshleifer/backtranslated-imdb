I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I had a movie with some funny jokes, and many that just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing down the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would have been funnier if they just had someone new, instead of resurrected Moriarty. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett of Hawaii 5-0 was not even like McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with the accents. She comes from Indiana, but played very well English and New York. Unfortunately, it was not presented much in the scenario. I was expecting a funny movie. Instead, I had a rather confusing movie with a mediocre storyline. Rather ironic, since Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Maybe they were about to split up in 77.
