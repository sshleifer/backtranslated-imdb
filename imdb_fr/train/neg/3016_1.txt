Like many, I'm a fan of Tony Scott's movies. When this movie was released, I was hopeful it would be like "Man On Fire". Discover that the film is the most distant solution! The story started right from the start, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And the whole arm scene was too free! <br /> <br /> The film is centered on Kiera Kinghtly and this film reveals that she will never become a movie star! The film has had some of the worst acting roles of all time. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott, but it takes all the cake! Sorry Ton, 1 of 10!
