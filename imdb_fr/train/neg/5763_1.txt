<br /> <br /> "Resign for the Hollywood veterans?" (The Wayan brothers were "interrogated"). That's what Hollywood wanted and that's what he got. However, like many of his recent decisions, this one was a great mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is SO disconnected from viewers, trying to bring back blunders and physical gags in place of a fun dialogue a disaster. I knew it, the public knew it and the CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a pity, why did they NEVER consider changing director? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played the role of two of the four main characters, without them, it's just a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
