OK I found this film in my father's old stack of movies and it looked good on the cover but the movie was really bad! OK, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get in, then the one with the boy was completely delayed! It was not even scary! His dream is like a little child's story. Then the new girls were completely delayed too. I'm sure someone will call the reporter and ask him to go out with you. But it ended well where she had stabbed him and was in the hospital. She saw him on TV and he told him all this junk. Then there was this nice gay story about the guy who brought the dead ... OMG, it's so stupid that I'm not even going to say more. The last was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool. Uh, yes, the girl is possessed and she kills all her classmates or something. Then, when they have all finished telling their dreams, the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
