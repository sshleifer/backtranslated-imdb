"New Best Friend" is another entry in the subgenre "steal the life of another woman"; the best are "Single White Woman" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"; the worst you can catch almost any afternoon on the chain for life. For some reason, this type of identity theft is reserved for women. <br /> <br /> There are only two ways to play this type of story. You can make the woman diabolical at first and let the audience know when she illuminates and implements her evil plan. You can also use the wrong direction to make her look good, since a series of seemingly unplanned events bursts into her favor until she turns out to be perverse on the climate scene. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of "New Best Friend" could not decide how they wanted to play and things crash and burn very early. First, we meet Alicia (Mia Kirshner) who scams the college's financial aid office for scholarships. We now know that she is a bad person and that she will suspect all her subsequent activities. But the director and the editor apparently forgot that this revelation was made and spent the next 50 minutes letting us down to make us believe that Alicia is a good person. This introduces the only element of suspense, not to know if it is perverse, but to know when the director and the editor will avoid us to waste our time with transparent direction errors. <br /> <br /> "The New Best Friend" suffers more than anyone from the curse of a teenager's movie of a cast too old to represent undergraduates. There are really only two big parties, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of production. It works almost for 26-year-old Kirshner, when she plays Alicia's mousy version, but it becomes glaring when she's turned into Alicia's glamorous version. The cast of Monroe is just a joke, as if Nicholette Sheridan was trying to pass as a classmate in "Lizzie McGwire". It is much more like a mid-life crisis than a project. <br /> <br /> Producers had to have a lot of favors because this age issue affects most of the secondary characters. Taye Diggs who plays the sheriff of the city is younger than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic configuration is that of Hadley and two other rich party-goers (played by Dominque Swain, 21 and Rachel, 35) are undergraduate roommates in college. They share (as a student residence) a mansion house nicer and better equipped than Real World-New Orleans (a more credible place than the footballers who play students). Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadley's life. At least this way, Swain finally gets a roommate of his own generation so that both can have a lesbian scene. Swain's performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend" and his love scene with Kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artistic that it does not fit any other segment. Perhaps she was outsourced to a good director and director of photography. <br /> <br /> The involuntarily hilarious story is presented in a series of mournful flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop nights, each followed by Alicia's comatose shot in a hospital bed. Kirshner spends nearly half of his time on the screen, motionless, a tube in his mouth. Not a good career shot Mia. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
