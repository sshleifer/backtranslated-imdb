It is unfortunate that you can not go lower than a star. Before watching The Wicker Man, I considered Aliens 3 as the only movie that deserves negative stars. In all honesty, The Wicker Man does not harm the pleasure of a previous movie, but the fact remains that the cumulative enjoyment of my film has been reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick often used in Hollywood when producers are too stingy to hire good screenwriters or in a hurry to allow them to carry out a conspiracy: slam into a shocking denouement and hope that the public will lend it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case only succeeds in splashing embarrassment on a good actor and in ridiculing the producers. Especially since the conclusion "carefully elaborated" (or whatever their formulation) does not seem to flow logically from the plot (which I can not naturally develop without introducing spoilers), and on the contrary denies the merit of the plot Until then. <br /> <br /> This is a film that could logically appeal to psycho-psychologists, pedophiles and perhaps to unconditional fans of Nicholas Cage, but only to a small number of its audience. If you really want something in this way, I highly recommend Mr. Night Shyamalan's Village. In the absence of some sort of pill that erases memory, I guess I have to look at something better to force him to think, for example, Killer Tomato Attack or Pee-wee's Great Adventure?
