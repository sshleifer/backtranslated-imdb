The eight films of Jean Rollin that I have seen are perhaps also the strangest; the intriguing plot (as it is) initially seems too fragile to endure even its 90 minutes of adjustment, but it somehow manages to become disproportionate over time! A potential vampire woman (barely clothed, as promised by the title) is held in captivity in a remote castle and emerges only to "feast" on the blood of volunteer victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) not knowing where all this would lead him, the screenwriter-director finally got the bad guy ?? in fact the perverse father of the empty-faced hero ?? ridiculously revealed as a mutant (?!) of the future! The languid rhythm and the dreamlike atmosphere (the followers wear hoods and masks of animals to hide their features to the protected girl) are of course typical of the filmmaker (same as the setting of the seaside at {anti} climax) and the "Euro-Cult" style, as well as the multitude of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about this visually appealing and intellectually empty affair was to see the well-known character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six recent Luis Bunuel films) emerge from from time to time with fun!
