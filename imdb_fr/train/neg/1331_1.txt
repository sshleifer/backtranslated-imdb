Collusion Course is even worse than the typical film of the week "male capitalist and ill-intentioned". This film is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good in his first underrated film, The Silverbears, in which he gives a performance that meets the requirements of his character. This film is so bad that the character of Leno, a pious buffoon, is less annoying than the character of Morita, a pious idiot.
