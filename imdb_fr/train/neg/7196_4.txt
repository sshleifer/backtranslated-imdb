INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> With: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick and Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Filed PG <br /> <br /> By Blake French : <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget", the new Disney movie, tells the story of a policeman named John surviving a major accident and saved by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that transforms him into a robotic agent has tools and gear of all kinds embedded in his body when used when he says "Go Go", only to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual structure of the film is very similar to Inspector Gadget's. himself. It's noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a pile of half-hearted gear thrown together to do something that does not have much in common with anything else. The film is essentially a series of zany action sequences that are somehow stuck with characters and an uneven story that only children ages 6 to 9 would appreciate. <br /> <br /> The radically reinvented cop is played by Matthew Broderick, who, until "Inspector Gadget", was on a hit series with films like "Election". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the villain of the movie, Claw. It is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced the catastrophe this year with the terrible "Dream of a Summer Night by William Shakespeare". <br /> <br /> There is a romantic subplot in this film as well as many scenes involving Body Parts and Wacky Mechanic Elements of Inspector Gadget. Gadget and Claw chat in front of Brenda's attractive character, portrayed by Joely Fisher, both for his appearance and for his knowledge of a specific invention of his dead father, who had already been killed by Claw. The competition evolves into battle scenes and because of many film events. The main character is also the Gadget Mobil, a life similar to that of an automobile designed for Inspector Gadget himself. He is voiced by D.L. Hughly of the sitcom comedy "The Hughly's". <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I found quite bad. I know I'm not really a target audience for filmmakers, but even my 10-year-old parent found the film disgusting. The film is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself worrying about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some opening credits, unlike the much worse movie of 1997, "Mr. Magoo", which opened with excerpts from the original drawing. Is asking too much the same kind of thing in this comedy, which is rarely funny and rarely convincing. The overall conception of production is nothing more than a mess of incomplete sight-seeing and consists of a joke: the clumsy stupidity of Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In films like this, the public hungry for limits - to help understand what can and can not happen. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such limits. It's really nothing more than a party for the actors, who had a lot of fun. I think of another missing comedy published a few years ago called "Blankman", which contained many props and energy. The actors certainly had fun with all the gadgets and accessories, but there was also something missing for each film: public participation. <br /> <br /> A character that I left a lot behind is the daughter of Gadgets, who at the end of the film, still has no idea of ​​his name. It is used only as a plot, and I wonder how it was used to advance the plot. Because his presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. We never know his reactions to his father's operation or accidents. So it is a person who could have been completely left out and who would not have affected the film a little. <br /> <br /> In closing, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible and insufficient excuse. for a children's comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this film to the action movie "Blade" of the public, violent and very anti-young. I say once again that I was much more in favor of a film in which nothing happens than a film in which everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much to do at the same time that it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
