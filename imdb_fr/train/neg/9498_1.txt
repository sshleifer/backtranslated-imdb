When I look for new cars, I expect not to be shown to boats. When I drink from the Coke Fountain, I have to expect the drink to contain Coca-Cola. When I look at a film that beautifies itself with the name of excellent scientist, I think it is somehow relevant to that person or his work. It could have been people talking about my grandmas' diary. The material covered is relevant only in the sense that they vaguely draw on science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I like science and documentaries. I would prefer to watch them on the latest blockbuster. However, this is far from providing something that is worth your time ?? Avoid at all costs.
