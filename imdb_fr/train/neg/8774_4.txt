Scenario: The film covers approximately 4 hours and adequately covers the events that occurred in the Kargil area near the LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and entered deep Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To learn more about the story, I would suggest that readers read the Kargil news. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you are looking for a story of formula in this film, we can be sure. is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots of bullets and blood. The movie theater where I saw this movie was full of whistles and shouts of joy when the movie shows Indian Bravery. The film's audience seemed similar to that of the audience during a cricket match between India and Pak. <br /> <br /> Watch the film as a tribute to the sacrifice of the army and the characterization of true war heroes (4 heroes rewarded by the PVC) who sacrificed their lives so that we can see this day. The film painted a brilliant portrait of the Army that fought against all odds in difficult weather conditions. The negatives of the movie are that it is too stretched and that the songs are extremely boring.
