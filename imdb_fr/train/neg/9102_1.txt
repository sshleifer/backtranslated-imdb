I was willing to go with the original Intentions of Cruel. He followed the plot and stayed true to the characters in one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my opinion, a shabby rehash with essentially the same story and no clear character choice. Honestly, I did not care what happened to them. The strongest part of the original story (The Liaisons, not CI) concerns the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I did not know clearly before reading in the BDMI that this movie was supposed to be a previous movie, especially since the title has a number "2". I was expecting a sequel, but then I decided it was a complementary text. Overall, I must say that this movie read me, at least in my opinion, a soft porn version of The Liaisons. I was not impressed.
