This movie really, I mean REALLY, is bad. His intrigue holes are so big, and a 10-meter dragon can sink through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image ever to be on the film. I mean, when you see something like that, you have to think, "Wow, somebody really did this movie, then he took it out, it takes guts." Whoever they are, I am sure they are no longer working in the film industry. <br /> <br /> When I started this film, it was not on DVD, so I (reluctantly). video. The first thing to appear was a Lord of the Rings trailer for both tours. It was a very smart move, putting this trailer on the video. This justifies me (reluctantly) to give the film a star, otherwise I would have given him zero stars. Maybe the producers, although Dean Cain's star attraction (I think that's how you write it), would attract crowds (um, to the video store, that's the case) . as in Hulk) to (I guess) compensate for the atrocity of this shitty movie. On the cover of the box, we see a picture of our hero and the dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like Dragon's Heart or is it just me? Anyway, the movie's dragon looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2 and has the CGI of a villainous Nintendo video game from the early '90s (maybe worse). Also, not the Dragons movement that pursues its victims - it's the same monotonous movement F ## cking - right leg, left leg, left right leg, dom, dom, dom, DOM, DOM, DOM, DOOOOOM! It pisses me off. Maybe the filmmakers thought it was exciting and would have the same effect as Jaws. Why not then have a shot of POV Dragon. Anyway, it was just funny, a bit like watching a Weebl toon. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain casts many puzzled looks during the film (perhaps he would understand that this film could end his career). Do not expect Superman here. The first time I saw the movie trailer, I thought it was an add-on for a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a shame, my 5-year-old brother can offer better results. those when he tries unconvincingly to lie about why he was messing around in my room when I was not there. Oh, and did I mention that I F @ # King hate the people who made this stupid stupid stupid movie? !!!
