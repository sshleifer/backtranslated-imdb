I was attracted by this film when I consulted the list of actors, but after watching it, I must admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem of this film is that the actors are not able to hold it on the back. Why? Because of a bad scenario. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are doing their best to take this film to another level, there is no new narrative and the direction is too ordinary. So, for fans of Matt Dillon, it's a movie to watch, just like the admirers of the beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is still good but it's not a movie for him; far below his level. So, if you are hooked by this superb cast, look at it but do not expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this movie will be Diane Lane's scenes; the rest is very forgettable.
