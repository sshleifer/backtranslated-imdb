It is hard to imagine that anyone can find this favorite short film if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that the humor is VERY subjective. I saw all their sound shorts (by far the best of their material, IMO) and I found one of their weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> The year of its creation (1930), Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and a feature. They were extremely popular and their boss, Hal Roach, took the opportunity to continue working. In addition, it was a period of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say it was an experience that did not really work. As someone else has said, it does not play with their strengths. Too many dialogues and intrigues. <br /> <br /> The best part of it is for me the largely improvised sequence with Stan in the role of maid Agnes and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girls". <br /> <If you really want to see the boys under their most creative and fun look, visit Blotto, or Brats, the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can forgive to produce a few shorts less than normal. They did something like 108 movies in all. Very few (except those of FOX) have been failures, but there are some. The County Hospital, Me and my boyfriend, The Phantom Live, The Top Above come to mind as weak beings. But apart from those, I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts. A record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all their other shorts, take a look at this one, but I'd bet that this one was less than memorable for Stan and baby.
