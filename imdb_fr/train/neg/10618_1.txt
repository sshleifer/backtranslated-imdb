The film is terribly awful and humiliating the rape victims. At first glance, it may be a bold rape film, but if you dig under the surface, it's a poorly positive message about rape. Aishwarya, a victim of rape, is shown to be a helpless victim who can not cope with all because she is a WOMAN. She needs a man to help him. When society jibers at her and makes comments to her, she does not defend herself. Anil Kapoor takes care of the whole dialogue while Aishwarya cries. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) was wrong in describing a rape victim as a weak and submissive person. What would have been more effective is to bravely portray a strong woman who rebels against her enemies. The director is famous for his chauvinism. His films are usually filled with weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He must learn that it is not because the role is controversial that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degrading scene in the movie is when Aishwarya "cleans herself" after rape. She does it to please her father who thinks she is dirty now. While it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a cruel light, what he does not show us is if Ash's father was wrong in making sure that his daughter does such a thing. So we have a confused message about rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is not necessary either in a film with a strong subject like this one. Even more, comedy is just not funny. Ash is wooden in his role while Anil Kapoor just screams. The music is mediocre, except for the title, which is beautifully described (the only brilliant point of this film). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and useless. Overall, what could have been a good film to remember ends up being a horrible mishmash that will give some viewers a severe indigestion.
