This film is more disappointing than ever, using a suspenseful actor like Walken to play in this piece of junk sounded like he had nothing better to do than to play a boring role like this -this! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be a witch and you really will not see it before the end of the movie, but you have to watch this boring movie while it's looking, or trying to understand the movie. meaning. of the point and you have to go through all this boring actor and actress track thinking all the time of how you spent another movie and decided on this one and how you just lost your money makes the point unnecessary time sitting there. I prefer to watch cartoons for God's sake. Leave this one alone, please!
