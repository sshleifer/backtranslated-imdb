I just do not understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. We can clearly see how frustrated they were with the censorship that forbade them to show so much in their films, and now they imagine that this artistic and far-fetched freedom is not that important, so fill your screen with people who defecate, urinate, vomit, swear and any other kind of hidiosity imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! It's just a visual perversion. Forget Bunuels Andalusian Dog, David Lynch, Forman, neorealism and other filmmakers capable of working with an aesthetic of ugliness. These people mastered their work - well, you do not do it! Do us a favor, all the Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other old obsolete ones, and leave us alone! It's a bit of a time to see some Romanian films on the screen, with your immature ghosts! You are not an administrator, you are ILLITERATE !!!
