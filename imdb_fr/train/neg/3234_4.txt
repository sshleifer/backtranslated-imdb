Well, how do you even evaluate a movie like this? Does it even have cinematic value really? It's a movie that tries to be as close as possible to a snuff film. Basically, the whole movie is purely a bunch of guys who are torturing a girl. Not very attractive and also not very realistic. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film has tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the movie is too fake for it to work as expected. The slaps and the blows are all soft and false. They are often just kicking the floor, rather than the girl, obviously. In addition, the way the girl reacts to all the torments is quite docile. I mean if it was real, she would have probably shouted at it. There are, however, more moans than cries in this one. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously small budget and is a valiant attempt to try to achieve something shocking and realistic, original and provocative, with very limited resources. I do not think this movie had a lot of impact at the time of release, even if it had to do something good, since a total of six suites came out after this one. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and gore will probably be disappointed by this film, even if there are still fetishists passionate about this film. <br /> <br /> 4/10
