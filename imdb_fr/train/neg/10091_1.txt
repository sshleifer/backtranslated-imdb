I can not believe this movie was ever created. I think at times, the director is trying to make an artistic piece, but it only makes things worse. The zombies seem to have too much makeup eyes. The zombies are in the movie only a few minutes. Finally, there may be five or six zombies in total, certainly not a nation. The best part of the film, if there is one, is the credits, because the painful experience is finally over. Again to reiterate other users' comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. In addition, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who simply does not make sense. It's never explained.
