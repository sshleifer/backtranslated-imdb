I stopped looking at this point of sale as soon as the snakes started to "pick up" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought maybe he should get a "one" for the comic relief. But then, I realized that I could watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever respect I had for Samuel Jackson, it was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood is once again showing how far removed they really are from reality. When I was a child, we caught snakes to amuse ourselves. The only thing the snakes would do is snuggle in the bottom of the cargo hold. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth going to see Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your dumb ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest the Descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy theater club. Their worst performance will be a million times better than this trash.
