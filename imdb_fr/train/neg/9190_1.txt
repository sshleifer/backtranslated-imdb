This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw some pretty horrible movies in my time but this one takes the cake, no, wait, I mean the bakery all fucked up. It's so bad that I think a word to describe how you feel after seeing this atrocity has not been created yet. Please, do yourself a favor, if you ever feel the need to watch this and watch thirty minutes of this boring Barney purple dinosaur, multiply it by thirty and you'll only have a small fraction of it horror that you would have in reserve for. In summary, I guess you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you're ready to be scared by the worst actor in history and a totally useless story. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Repugnant
