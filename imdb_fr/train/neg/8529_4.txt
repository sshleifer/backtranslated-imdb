What prompted MGM to put the brilliant Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army employee? Ironically, another beautiful future star, Cary Grant, also played a Salvation Army character just two years later in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I think with hindsight it's pretty easy to see the craziness of those roles, but I still wonder if the WHO thought the Salvation Army guys were "HOT" and could look at them see them as realistic representations of their roles. A long time ago, I was working for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the Volunteers of America) and I have NEVER seen handsome guys working on it (and that includes me, unfortunately). I should have had a job with the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So for the more curious, it's a good movie to watch, but for everyone, it's bad writing, a sloppy dialogue and boring moralizing make a very slow movie.
