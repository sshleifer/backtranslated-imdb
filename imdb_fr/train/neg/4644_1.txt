This film is terrible. The story is about a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, from black / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror and more. The film has a very confusing structure, with for example a frequent use of backtracking without integrating them into the story. The plot is undeveloped and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and who they were playing. There are improbabilities in many movies, but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies an unknown stranger to his home, then agrees to ride alone (where he says she will find a phone), without the weapon she has brought with her, call the police, was too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very mediocre: we were watching a 42 "TV to allow anyone with a smaller set to understand what was going on in the scenes in total darkness. , a chaotic mess.
