Extremely dreary drama featuring a very young Roddy McDowall, who drives a wild horse, the Flicka's title, and that's the only reason to watch the movie in the first place. Covered with overwhelming and dominant music and weighed down by a schmaltzy dialogue, it's one of those endless movies that bores you to the point of hurting your head. The sequel to the astounding title, "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka," in which McDowall forms the next generation of nag, is slightly better than the original version, but the pace remains slow and the score continues to make you submit, although There are at least one or two scenes that do not cause coma.
