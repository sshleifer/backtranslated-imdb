Having read many of the comments here, I am surprised to find that no one has recognized it as a too long remake of a 1960 episode of the Twilight Zone called "Mirror Image" with Vera Miles. Rod Serling was much better at creating a scary story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this tedious repetition. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained end, but in a feature film, there should be a little more substance and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and meaning are two things that are missing in "The Broken". Yes, there are a few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional observations: although it is clearly a contemporary story, no character in the film has a mobile phone! And even if a car accident is the event that makes history, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person driving the other car or to the police who would have been held. to do a report. My advice: skip this hole and look at the original instead!
