REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 stars out of 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestor for George A. Romero's classic zombie movies. It's a low-budget boiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to the public at the time ... but that seems terribly routine these days. There is actually a pretty good scene at the beginning of a soldier who fires his pistol at a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close up shot of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect seems desperately wrong these days, but in 1936 I'm sure the audience was breathless. The story is about finding the secret of mind control ... to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a way for a character to win the woman he loves. The film lasts barely an hour but is moving with no turtle, so it seems to be long, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... you may get a little fun with the fake shots in the studio of the star wading in a "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I would say that the film is worth a visit at least once. It is more than likely that you would see it as an additional feature in the cheap compilation of "4 movies on 1 DVD" at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, well worth the money ...
