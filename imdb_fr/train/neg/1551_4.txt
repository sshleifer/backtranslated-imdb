The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thinking behind this, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? In fact, it's better than most SNL movies (Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the film). Apart from that, the rest of the cast is in the middle and is only there to support Meadows. I have certainly seen more fun movies, but I've also seen more stupid movies. Again, it's not really a deep film, but it's good for some laughs. It was still more funny as a sketch. But still, if you are looking for a funny movie, I would recommend this one. Just do not think about it too much, otherwise you'll hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
