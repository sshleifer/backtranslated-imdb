I would have liked to write about the story, but there was none. I would have liked to quote a few punchy dialogs from the movie, but "hinglish" is only funny for about 5 minutes, after which it becomes excessive. I would have liked to avoid the suspense, but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a film by Yash Raj (?). I would have liked to talk about the action at the limit, but I do not really like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is perfect for: 1. Those who try to commit suicide - I promise you that it will push you Beyond the limit 2. Masochists - This film is much more effective than the barbed wire that the character of Silas bore in the code Da-Vinci. 3. People looking for alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I swear that the audience leaving the room seemed to want to kill someone. 4. Movie pirates: more power for them. If a film deserves that the public does not spend money to watch it, that's it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all living things would need a factor of IQ slightly higher than the one proposed by the film. Afterwards: The director of the film is obviously a species apart. (And I hope God is the only one of his kind .. there are enough) <br /> <br /> What could have improved this film: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (have I already said that?) 6. A director - preferably a non-mentally handicapped person (even if a challenge could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Plague - To be avoided at all costs 8. A legal warning - "Watching movies from Yash Raj is detrimental to your sanity"? <br /> <br /> What I liked in the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is in a void" , "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" is transformed into "I am a flirt, I am a lover, I am a vagabond" ... without price. <Br /> <br /> In short, Tashan for me, is like the opposite of a cube of rubrics - The cube is supposed to increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that in barely two hours and a half. ! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But it's just me. I could be wrong. You have been warned anyway.
