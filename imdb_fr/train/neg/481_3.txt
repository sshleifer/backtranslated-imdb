Whenever a film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a particular end or point of view that it simply does not care about a real story, it's boring. These are the types of movies where the end or point of view is designed first, and the story is simply taken into account. For this reason, we often talk about the story "jumping through hoops", trying in vain to progress to the end preordained in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The story of "Comet Over Broadway" Do not just jump through hoops, it's a three-ring circus. It's so ridiculous, so badly conceived, so hypocritical that, if you're inclined to speak loudly in front of the screen, you'll make a fury before it's all over. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this scenario The cloaca is that of a woman who chooses between family and profession. Because everything is so horribly confused, it will end up offending people of either opinion. In the end, the story no longer makes sense, the theme is no longer relevant and, as is often the case in bad scenarios, the acting game saves nothing.
