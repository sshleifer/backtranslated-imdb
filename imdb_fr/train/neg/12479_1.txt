DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-Fantasy fans; this parody of a film shoot of barely 80 minutes has all the hecklers can ask - nonexistent intrigues, terrible scenes (except at least one old lady with a hoarse sound), scripts and montage of laughable schlocks, and background to setting mode. There are no characters that seem nice or interesting (in particular, the lead role has no appeal to him), and the assembled actors do almost nothing to rise above the quality material F. If that was not enough, what about the lack of compelling plot (which this movie has nothing to do with) to make DEATHSTALKER the title of major turkey? I was also offended to see that the women in this film are used for anything other than 1) being naked and / or slightly dressed; 2) to be raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. Moreover, the ambient music is hideous; a weird mess of electronic noises, choral cheese bursting and orchestral cacophony. Numbing the eyes and numbing the eyes, all in one without any concern to interest, DEATHSTALKER is probably better suited to people looking for something to laugh (and believe me, there are many here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this level 100 CONAN to everyone.
