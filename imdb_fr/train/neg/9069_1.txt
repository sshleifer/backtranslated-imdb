The script of (David H. Steinberg) initially seemed to have some really smart points that could have made a good romantic comedy, BUT BUT BUT, oh my God! What happened in this way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I will tell you what happened. Originally, it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it's a long time ago, but it's the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre: the brutal teen comedy. Then the 1990s came. After important cases that have become successful successes (those that are disgusting, I add), such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996) and (There are something about Mary - 1998) thinks that slackers are affected by, there was the peak of the time and the prophet of the next era, the one and only: (American Pie - 1999) which is without any doubt and incomparably the icon of a genre. After that, I think that all comedies of this kind should be as disgusting as possible, to be admired by the youth, otherwise it would be old fashioned! <br /> <br /> I think (Slackers) had a scenario was first a scenario, then its creators had to add large amounts of: rudeness, uncleanliness, sex strangely shameful to do - at that time - as simple as hello! As if they had to fill each scene with free elements such as: masturbation, fellatio, urination .. etc. just to look fashionable. These are completely useless elements in the story, but they are so essential to make profits and catch the latest fashion in making comedies for teenagers. The problem lies in the fact that all this has already replaced any possible comedy. <br /> <br /> Some of his moments were literally horrible, and that's what you see. Everything is in the appearance and performance of (Jason Schwartzman); memorably disgusting to the max. Thus, the ambition of this romantic comedy turned into a pure realization of stripped images. To be more like a horror where you ask all the time; what would happen better (vomiting, farting, etc.); It's the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays. <br /> <br /> Even if you hate it, you have to like something (especially to be daring), it was for me only the cameo scene Gina Gershon. Be that as it may, they have conceived of it as a whole to become outrageous outrages, like the ugly dream of a teenager. Although the majority has been close to anyone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad was that this one was basically a real work potential, and not another stupid comedy, another stupid comedy that finally managed to be. Remember the details of the flight of the exam (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of the film (weird to try to touch a girl by singing cool guys) through the pattern of (boy likes girl and girl love another boy), because except that, this is just a candid schlock. He treated his equipment in the same way that bandits bandits, which had nothing to do, but to do anything with the mawkish would do the trick. It ended up being, and I'm sorry to say, a smiling smile! <br /> <br /> In the end, he said something (can you imagine!) on the fact that it's also the time and place for the impostor or the lazy to win, quite like this comedy itself. It seems to end for a whole other best movie; which could assure my opinion on this one as smart .. Once! And it does not take much to understand that the directors of this film were the real idlers! Being stupid is perhaps a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even so ... The end result was not at least spiritual. <br /> <br /> PS: His screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story of (American Pie 2), has a main page at the IMDb where you will find the "Additional Details". his usual "Keywords of the plot" which are: Sex / Vulgarity / Humor Brut / ... They just forgot to write Urinate while showering or exposing 70 year old women!
