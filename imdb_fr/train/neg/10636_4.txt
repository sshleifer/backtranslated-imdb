I was really looking forward to this show considering the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were disappointed! Again, we are inclined to believe that the KGB is a group of idiot idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a ludicrous scene where 4 KGB agents can not handle any CIA agent. I get tired of these biased, one-sided and completely inaccurate representations of the Spy game that took place during the Cold War. I find it laughable that the United States is unable to make objective films about their involvement in the Second World War and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States got the Enigma machine, again completely wrong. <br /> <br /> To his credit, "The Company" is very well filmed and played well. Locals are also exceptionally well done. Alfred Molina performs a good performance like Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and I will probably end up watching the other 2 episodes, but I really hope that American productions stop trying to describe their Spies, their soldiers, etc. as supermen who are intellectually and physically superior to others. planet. It ages quickly and seriously harms the likelihood of what could have been a 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
