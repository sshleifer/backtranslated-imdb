Brilliant technology. But what good is it if the content is hollow and stupid. I left after less than 30 minutes of observation, bored and irritated. <br /> <br /> The theater administration returned my money, but the time has passed and the aggravation has remained. I was and not thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction. <br /> <br /> George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you have been well paid. You might even have liked it. I apologize for my limited mind. Many people seemed to like that too. Look at the comments. Oh well ... <br /> <br /> I'd like to know - what's boring at a distance in a story about Mr. Fox, husband, father, citizen, ... whatever.
