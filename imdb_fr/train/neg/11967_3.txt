Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980s, Personal Best would have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of the Cahill's life. <It seems to me that the creators of this movie have created a same-sex relationship between two rather attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 second exposure of several women's legs jumping back on a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance for the film and it seemed like this was done just to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I guess the producers were trying to thwart the boring plot and even boring frame of the movie (the 1980 Oregon athletics competition). <br /> <br /> This opinion may seem severe, but it's the truth. The exploitation of the body of the young Muriel Hemingway and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit I would have given to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
