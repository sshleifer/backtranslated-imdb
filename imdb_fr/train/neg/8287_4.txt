It's really a TV version of the tale, the movie begins as an episode of 'Xena ...', with little meaningful dialogue or description of the character. It becomes a little more substantial after a while, but all the characters are still caricaturists. <br /> <br /> Salma is exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a diabolical and sexually repressed Frollo, who intends to smash a nut to Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> This is also a fairly liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, as the abbot in 'Name of the Rose', and Quasimodo is a defender of freedom . The dark side of Quas's character is ignored, though he pours liquid on people. He is really an outsider since he has a different look and likes to play with bells more than average. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie is for children, but I doubt it, since Frollo gives himself blood to freeze himself to want to spank his monkey. An interpretation of the tale rather uninteresting and forgotten, but not terrible and sometimes amusing.
