... except for Jon Heder. This guy did everything in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed fun. A hapless 29-year-old son (Heder) still lives with a widowed mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). The lazy son is jealous and eager to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but whoever throws Hader would be better selling hot dogs on the beach. Heders' performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he's playing an annoying guy, the problem is he's too bad actor to lose this act making this guy nice in the final. In the end, you still want to be able to hit the guy personally and you're upset by the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be a no-go for me!
