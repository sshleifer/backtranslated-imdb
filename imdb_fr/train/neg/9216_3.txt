Hoo boy, it was a real trial to pass. Tom Hanks's cup is stuck on the DVD case and that's the only reason everyone would buy it. He seems to be about forty years old on the box, however, the film was shot in 1982, so he still has his back. The plot is about a Dungeons and Dragons game in which Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking that everything is real. Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of fun hats. Ooh, look, he has a yellow helmet with a tuxedo! Now he is dressed as a pilot of the First World War! It was a really horrible film but in a bad way. A group of veterinarians appear mainly as parents of children. There is Anne (I'm Honey West, damn it!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who look really sexy. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has a thankless role as a cop. Wendy Crewson, is the love interest of Hanks and a blonde guy that I have never seen before. There is syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he's crazy, you know. The monster is played by the late Kevin Peter Hall, the late predator. One of my friends took this out of the old MallWart discount basket and advised me to throw it in the trash without even looking at it. So naturally, I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumped off one of the World Trade Center towers because of his illusions, he goes home to recover and his friends visit him. Hanks' mother, Vera Miles, drunk, says he's doing well now, but when they go to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he's crazier than ever. The end
