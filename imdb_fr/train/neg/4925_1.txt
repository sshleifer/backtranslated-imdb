Please do not waste your time. This film traces the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's vampire Lestat (rock music and silly Bible references), and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like movies and novels about vampires, and there are many who are very good. But not that fucking. Even the soundtrack does not help, mainly because the film uses scary and ridiculous classical music rather than "kick-ass metal", as some have said. Only a few times I heard metal; they were mainly violins. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
