I had time to kill before watching football. So I saw this film being broadcast on the scifi channel. After watching it, I thought I had met my version of Bataan's death march while my conscience was struck by this terrible movie. movie that snatched the series Mummy and Jurassic Park. It was so serious that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie, and then it went downhill so abysmal that it seemed that the recent fall of the stock market looked like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. The main role of Casper Van Dien made me dream of Steven Seagal's high-profile actor in "On Deadly Ground" because his reading was so much wood that Woody Woodpecker was planning to make an appearance on his shoulder. I also noticed that his range of emotions was so limited that I felt that my kitten was more expressive when he asked for popcorn to eat. The management was so abominable that I returned to my nephew's third year recital, which had more rhythm and better vision, and the fact that this film seems to have been united after the reflections of the aforementioned film franchise. . a tribute. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were environmentally friendly by recycling the cheap special effects of Z-rated horror movies of yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis have done in this film is beyond me, and they should consider prosecuting their agents for misrepresentation if they have involved them in such a dreadful movie. My warning to everyone is to watch this movie at your own risk because this movie can cause a decrease in your IQ with extended viewing. On a side note, I noticed at IMDb that sometimes movie salaries are published. I wondered if it was a way for the actors to give back the wages for their bad performances in such films. Beware and be sure to avoid at all costs.
