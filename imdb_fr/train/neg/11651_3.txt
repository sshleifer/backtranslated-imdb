Since this film was edited in less than a year, this could explain its brevity (81 minutes - final credits, about 76 minutes of film). But what he can not explain is his lack of humor that the previous movie had. <br /> <br /> The gags are fast and sometimes not fun. The only really fun pieces are the quick parodies on the Nike basketball spots, the portrait of Max Van Sydow's character in The Exorcist by James Woods, and fragments scattered throughout the film. Charlie's Angels, who, like the first Scary Movie and the movie Matrix spin-off, has simply recreated the scene without too much humor. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to tell parody of classic supernatural horror movies from the 70s, such as the exorcist and perhaps Poltergeist, 80s, and. al. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Scary Movie 3 will take time to set up, which will make periodontics more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing however, the film presents more than the last promising aspect the young actress Anna Faris (who, I admit, seemed unusually hot in the sequel). For her talents as an actress and actress, I give this film a "3" on "10".
