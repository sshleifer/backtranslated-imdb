This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I really can not understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is a reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do anything she wants, she falls in love with this nasty man. 2. How can the scenario be so weak? She was so rich, can do anything she wants, but does not dare to divorce her husband, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I love you, it did not mean anything in this movie.
