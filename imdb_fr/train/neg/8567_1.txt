When I rented this movie, my expectations were very low ...... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen, except for one thing: they could add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give him 0 and a half out of 5.
