Did the filmmakers even see this before publishing it? The script jumps from one place to another without giving a lot of explanations. The beginning does not specify if it's a prequel or not. It starts with Superman's debut on Earth, then jumps to a point after the last movie - but does not really alert the viewer. Very disturbing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is described as a potential home destroyer, a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character is rarely an interesting hero. The end is absolutely ridiculous. Superman ending up in a hospital made me want to kill him myself. I am seriously waiting for a SNL skit where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says: "The results are positive, in the case of the child, Superman, you are the father." In summary - OK, actor of this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is fundamentally unassailable.
