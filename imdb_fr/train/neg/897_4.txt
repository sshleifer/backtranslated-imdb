Two years before writing and performing "Arthur," Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this comic vehicle at the crackpot of Henry Winkler, then viewer of "The Fonz." A 1950s philosopher (and a general idiot) seeks a student and marries without any prospect of employment; To make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of struggle and ends up becoming a celebrity of the "Gorgeous George" type. Making the friendly Winkler an odious gaffe seemed like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his TV alter-ego), but jokes and situations are often sneaky and mean rather overlooked director Carl Reiner. Herv√© Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") starring Polly Holliday (Flo de "Alice"). As Henry's lover, Kim Darby seems a bit out of her element - especially when she's surrounded by all those television hams - making the romance aspect of the screenplay irrelevant. * 1/2 of ****
