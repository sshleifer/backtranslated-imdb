I am a big fan of horrible movies, my game is all that is ridiculous and ridiculous. So imagine my mind, I went to the local rental store and found Vampires Vs. Zombies. The name is too much fun, you know that no one in the world could do anything like that, it must be bad. <br /> <br /> And then, is it bad? After watching this horror movie, I was literally speechless. My boyfriend and I sat outside without saying a word for several minutes, both contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words "... man ... what?" Yes, I am an exciting individual. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick overview of the street: The Plot; There is none at all, never, constantly in "WTF" mode. Characters; No development, forgettable. The music; Worse than porn. The vampires; Their vampires? The zombies; Their Zombies? <br /> <br /> At the end; Honestly, everyone should see this movie, it's such a shame that I want to see it again. So treat yourself, look at it and get depressed.
