Fortunately, there is no video of this western wannabe that is a vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was collapsing. The story of a weasel who lives off the reputation of her big brother in guns and who is being chased out of the city by villains never to rally his townsmen with new courage must have been written by a writer from the back shop. Overall, this show stinks. The story is fundamentally boring, ill-conceived, and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to leave completely the other critic who found it "... underestimated ..." Critics criticized it at the time and rightly so. You will have to see it during the last show, if you get up late and have an insomnia. But, if you can sit there, you will have more courage than most of my movie buffs.
