Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a Wild West troupe, one of the six unsuitable regulars who make up a rough traveling show. The seventh member of the platoon is a woman, Billy's assistant, but these women never last and the position is open all the time. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke's Eastwood girlfriend at the time). It seems that Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is an alleged heiress who will not receive the estate of her father, who has passed away long ago, if she is married at the age of 30. to the designer Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what's the plot of this movie? It's hard to say. There's a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that, for the first half of the movie, she's so proudly insipid and hateful that when she suddenly becomes "one of the gangs" halfway through movie is not only amazing, but the audience has gone well, he cares about her. There is a chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this subject is not sufficiently addressed to really be the raison d'Ãªtre of the film. Miss Lilly found herself in a difficult situation: being stuck in the rural west, cut off from the funds that feed her spoiled luxury life (she is mistakenly thought to have died by her family and the press). But are we really supposed to believe that she could not go back to New York and wait for her fortune if she put in a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the purpose of this film seems to be that Billy is the head of a family, a group of adorable losers who unite to thicken. It's a hot and fuzzy film ?? or at least tries to be. <br /> <br /> On the way, Clint shows us his talents with a gun, even thwarting a bank robbery in a grotesquely grotesque shootings in an otherwise relatively non-violent film. One of the gang members is arrested for an old evasion charge; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The tent of the show burns; an orphanage makes a new one. But many banal traps do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> The problem is aggravated by acting, or lack thereof. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the cast is quite amateurish. Eastwood is not at the top of his game either, although he looks better simply because he is surrounded by such a dull group. <br /> <br /> And for all that, the film goes forward for 116 minutes. At what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
