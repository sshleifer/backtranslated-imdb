Having seen Versus previously, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD cover looked promising. Alive did not deliver. Very slow development. Lots of potential with casting and cool visuals. The premise was intriguing, but the result did not compensate for the accumulation. I could have done a lot more at the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". To put it plainly, we were three to be ready to watch this film and after 50 minutes we had trouble getting by. He really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus fights, then save yourself dollars and tons of disappointment.
