History undeveloped / incredible, (at the moment when I realized where he was going, I did not care anymore) bad casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a killer ????) Bad staging ever seen Tracey Ullman perform so badly?) (Was I supposed to worry about what happened to the incompetent and unethical character John Ritter? ?) Wrong scenario ...) the only really good thing in it was the kid. Ten lines? It's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines? Go ahead, who are the rules? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Is not that kind of arbitrariness? Why is it not ok to have less than 10 lines of comments?
