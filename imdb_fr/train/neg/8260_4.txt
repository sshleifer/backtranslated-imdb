First of all, I would like to point out that, although I am not an expert, the way the trial was organized will insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution never proved that "facilitated learning" actually worked. Irresponsible of both the lawsuit (because they can appeal) and the defense for not acting on it. As another stakeholder said, facilitated learning has proven to be inaccurate. Second, they used Terry as a translator who has a personal interest, and even will testify, in the trial that is just stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify in this way, they would have brought someone neutral or they would only ask for an appeal. Thirdly, the prosecution never asked the child specific questions about the accused (birthmarks, details of the incident, etc.) and, even when the defense asked him specific questions, such as example when it started, he could not answer. If it is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is and a competent lawyer would have obtained the acquittal. <br /> <br /> In the end, it starts well under the pressure of a child's father autism, but the lawsuit makes this movie totally unbelievable.
