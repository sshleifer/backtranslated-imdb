can a film become more naive than that? you can not believe part of this script. and its predictable ssooooo that you can tell the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. The lead actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she does not succeed, the doll has MORE gaming skills). <br /> <br /> The ease with which the character passes and stays in a music school makes the ghost of the opera novel seem to be a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but one of the good sides of the film is the performance of Madsen who managed to give life to a one-dimensional character in the melo. <br /> <br /> The film is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. I think 13-year-old Britney-obsessed girls shouted, "Oh, give us a break, if we want fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm book is still hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave him 2 instead of one for Virginia Madsen.
