Yes, I sat all the way, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was extremely cold outside, all right, these are all lame excuses but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 out of 10 stars - I saw worse movies, but this one is there, in the old trash can of bad movie - bad story, game of mediocre actor, bad lighting and nerdy special effects. <br /> <br /> The scenario, which never makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, dad, mom and little girl - which I suppose The viewer is supposed to "identify" with, they were all three tedious and boring. You just want the dark side to have each one. <br /> <br /> Dad is a cook who loves cars. Dad meets a rich man called Rubin who collects cars and who also owns a being he bought in the "mysterious" East. Rubin keeps him in a birdcage and calls him "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the film, the Darkling is explained by three or four different things: a shadow without anyone, the inner darkness that exists in each of us and the devil. So choose one of these explanations that suits you best, because believe me, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Darkling seems to be that he really wants to have a companion. gets a human companion - and is finally dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, creates immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human being who associates with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us, this simply leads to a very long, tedious film. . <br /> <br />
