This science fiction channel is made for television and is rather useless. It tells the story of Beowulf, especially after the recent movie "Beowulf and Grendel" of 2005. This film does not really enter the story of Beowulf, but delivers his fight against the voracious beast known as Grendel, because he leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the mighty Viking warrior Beowulf is called to rid them of the rampage of the monster. If this succeeds, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep him at bay. After some unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but her angry and vengeful mother attacks quickly, leaving Beowulf to lend her mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat her. "Grendel" seems to have been shot on a small budget and the effects of CG are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely useless.
