Ultimate Dreck. I arrived at 16 minutes / 27 seconds and I gave up. If that were possible, I would have given a negative number of critics (although "pitiful" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle that could be seen and felt practically between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry that exists between the stupid old Dicky Crenna and his face is nonexistent. The ankle becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? There is no ciggy ignition with your fingertips? And I thought I'd be sick when they'd look mortified (and rightly, believe me), Lee J. Cobb as Keyes purring practically through the explanation of his "little man" to Mr. Garloupis. Do not offend the blind, but it seems that a bunch of blind men has been unleashed with the scenography of the houses Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for the horrible checked trousers that Phyllis wears. And Crikey, how much does Neff win, he lives with a view on a huge marina? Again, it's all in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can spend more time, you have a constitution much stronger than me or you are masochistic. But please, first take the Alka-Seltzer, otherwise you will develop your own "little man" who may never go away. Proceed with caution, of course.
