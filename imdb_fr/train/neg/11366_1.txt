The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a preview. It had not even been in first. I remember there was someone on the staff of the directors, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian film, we never heard about it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he stands out from the others. He plays an actor whose star has long since gone up. He participated in the making of a film in Belgium entitled "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the film started, we noticed how much there was a lot of swearing. Nothing against occasional cursing. However, it was far beyond annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when a cast member, a non-English uses the word F **** or *** S, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost count of the number of times used the words F and S. Everyone was glad to be out of the theater. And we had to vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10, and were looking for the -10.
