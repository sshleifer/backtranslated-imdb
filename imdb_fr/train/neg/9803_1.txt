The Power Rangers are definitely the worst television series and a completely ridiculous range of plastic toys in US history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this completely horrible TV show. <br /> <It's simply the worst show of all time, with awful actors, who dress in multicolored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, because No redeeming value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Kids today should try to watch better programs, like Toy Story movies, instead.
