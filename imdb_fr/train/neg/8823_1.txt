It's one of the worst B slashers I've ever seen in my life. The end is something you have to see to believe it. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing up on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney dressed in a Santa Claus costume. He places the presents under the tree, eats the biscuits and the milk, then goes back up the chimney. Phillip goes to bed but Harry only goes down to find his father wearing a Santa costume sexually pleasing his mother. Then Harry goes up the stairs, breaks a snowball, catches a burst of glass and cuts himself off. <br /> <br /> Then you go to the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man sleeping in a Santa suit and looking at the little children through a pair of binoculars. He has two books. A book for good kids and one for bad kids. He writes everything they do in these books. The guy is a creep. He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry discovers that his boss only cares about making money, he will collect all the toys and give them to some children. . Then he goes to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and places presents under the tree. The children catch him but they go back to bed. So, Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he heads for a house, a group of children spots him and rushes toward him. Parents are nervous and try to get their children back so they do not hurt. How do they know that Harry is the killer? Of course, you must be suspicious because you never know who it could be. Harry offers gifts to the children and the father removes a knife to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs off, the villager lights torches and follows him to kill him. They do not even know he's the killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, he and his brother talk a little and Phillip strangles him. He is just losing consciousness. Phillip puts Harry in his van. When Harry wakes up, he goes away. <br /> <br /> The end is something I could not believe. Once again, you will have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me is Black Santa Claus. That's right, the man in Santa Claus costume they saw was a white man. So why did they bring in a black man? <br /> <br /> Ignore this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You'll get what you pay for, which is worth seeing these two movies. They are better than this pile of garbage! I give this film 1 out of 10 stars. I wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this film deserves.
