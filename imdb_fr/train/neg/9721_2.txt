Who could possibly sympathize with these two odious protagonists? What is supposed to be a light and frothy comedy about children who can not abandon their challenge game from their childhood as they grow up to adulthood, is more like an exercise in cruelty and complacency to oneself. As children, both are extremely precocious; as adults, they are intolerably immature. It's a bad combination.
