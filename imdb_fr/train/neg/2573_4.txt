If you have a lot of time to lose ... it's good. It is moving at a good pace, but to finish this film, it would take a little more time and a little more background. <br /> <br /> The acting game is OK. Mariana Klaveno as a babysitter does the best job and is the most credible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a pretty good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, the woman had a weak role and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is a bit silly. As in most child care movies, some parts are interesting, but overall, you wonder why you spent your time.
