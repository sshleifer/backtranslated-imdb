I had the pleasure of watching this movie early and I must say that I thought it was going to be boring and I was wondering how they could improve the 1984 Bachelor Party version with Tom Hanks, which I found pretty good ... J I was right ... In all honesty, I thought it could have been better ... Of course, there were fun times, but it just did not seem to hit the target. follow the original but I think it could have been so much better ... This film, I would say, is aimed at teenagers and young at heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical movie from the movie Mill Party that has been filmed again and again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
