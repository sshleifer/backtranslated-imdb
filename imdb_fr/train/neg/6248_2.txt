Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes through the window and "belief" and "consensus" become the subject of discussion. <br /> <br /> Al Gore documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world by spending billions of dollars to "stop global warming," you might say that it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not do not know how much the current warming has been caused by humans. Maybe nothing, maybe a part, or maybe it has given way to the next ice age and we are really lucky not to have boiled the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we do not let it know. <br /> <br /> we are therefore asked to "believe" in "consensus". It does not matter if any scientist who moves away from "consensus" is excluded. Never mind, scientific inquiry is about moving away from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, neither Copernicus nor Galileo. <br /> <br /> Why so much contempt for these same researchers who would advance the field by asking difficult questions? If global warming is so compelling, some people testing this theory can not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the movie I hoped to have directed by Al Gore. In the first place, he chose to strengthen his support for the true "believers" of the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
