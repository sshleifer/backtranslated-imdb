What can I say about Cruel Intentions 2? Honestly, I can honestly say that I will only watch this movie again if I am attached to a chair and have my eyes wide open, in the orange clock way. <br /> <br /> Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose terrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne tries (and fails) to play a beautiful charismatic, charming. Since the actor is neither beautiful nor charismatic nor charming, the character is totally incredible. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of Buffy once), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar stopped and give life to intriguing Katherine ... However, Adams is not a good actress and her performance has was flat and devoid of any real emotion, she often seemed to read memory cards right in front of the camera. There were however two good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion Powers), have done very good and entertaining shows as parents of Sebastian and Katherine. rated the film as a 2 and not a. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a mediocre version of the original, with minima such as a copy of dialogue and scenes imitated that lacked the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think that, as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been reworked with people who could play the lead roles.
