OMG is one of the worst films ever seen and seen a lot, I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she really need the money? I love AJ and I have seen almost everything. So I watched this video 2 backwards. It was so bad! not bad, just bad, bad. There were 1 or 2 fun little moments, but overall it was a 101 minute loss. I can not even say that AJ looked good because she did not do it. The plot is predictable unless you expect a new reading of Romeo and Juliet, so this is not the case. All disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good movie otherwise I do not really recommend it.
