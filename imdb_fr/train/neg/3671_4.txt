The dull, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical (Weller) who travels the country just to find his ex-wife and children; during this time, he kills everyone in his own way only by one touch of his hands. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young journalist (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has a premise not original but even if it could be much better. The end result is just a movie without suspense or squeaks. Even the good distribution is completely wasted. I give him a 4 (four).
