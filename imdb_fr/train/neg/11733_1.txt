I'm shocked that there are people who liked this movie. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience mocked him in scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but honestly, the plot of this film required a revision MAJEURE ... it did not even make sense, a second the characters are wondering what is exactly what they sniff stage they are desperately addicted and understand how to do it ?? Also the end has just taken the cake..I will not spoil the beautiful conclusion..but it mixes pretty well with the rest of the plot / horrible script ... see this movie for comedy if you have to. .
