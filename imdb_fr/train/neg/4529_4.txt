I will not describe the story, as has been done elsewhere. We are big fans of Clive Owen and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that we have never heard of this "film" because it was a 1992 BBC Television film. As a result, poor production values, a grainy image, a jerky camera work and a mediocre sound. <br /> <br /> But the mechanics do not really bother you, because the story itself will make you sleepy. It's an interesting human story, but not at all convincing, and there's almost no end. You do not really care about characters because their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the weather more interesting.
