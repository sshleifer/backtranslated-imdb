I vaguely remember Ben from my fictional science fiction years of the '60s. I did several interviews and biographies of dark actors / actresses, including Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961 in The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people attending a discreet science fiction meeting in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a nice conversation with him, his "career" and his life. All these articles have been published in a fanzine of the day long forgotten. I would have liked to have copies of these interviews, but time is running out, and none of these people would surely remember me so many years later. Ben was a very kind guy, who made a good living (the inconvenience of those days did not even pay their guest, unless, of course, they were big stars, and even then, the salary was a few Hundreds of dollars at the most! Good to know that Ben is still alive and in great shape! Why not a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly then, uglier now!
