Any movie in which Brooke Shields is ahead of a Fonda will be both an anomaly and a horror. Shields is only really bad because she is young, inexperienced, and clearly misguided by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. I loved him in Ulee's Gold, years later, but Lord, he's awful here. Not that anyone else is good. There is not a single performance (apart from Henry Fonda's delicious cameo) that is even passable. I have never seen a movie with so much bad performance. In the case of Luke Askew, the chief villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction, as he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is simply horrible, and the actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say them so badly! Mounting and steering are worse than pedestrians. Plans are held too long without dramatic reason, or cut before the impact of the scene can be realized. This image was much worse than I had imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never realized) without the participation of some famous names. On a positive note, Grand Canyon cinematography is exquisite, capturing the beauty of this region in a way that even Imax widescreen productions have not done as well. And finally: either it is a bad version of Paper Moon, with an adorable pair of father-daughter types, or a mediocre version of Pretty Baby, with a much more thorny romantic relationship between a man of forty and something and another old. This suggests more the last than the previous one, and is therefore quite disturbing.
