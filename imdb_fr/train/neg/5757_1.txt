The film was visible while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight against boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep for making scenes without Jack; she was as bland as possible. The relationship between the characters was nothing special. these characters have already been described - and much better. It sounded like a real-life scenario in the worst absolute sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or watching. Why Ephron felt that his life and his relationship with Carl Bernstein were interesting enough that I could talk about his leaks. Perhaps she wrote it as therapy - for many writers, putting an episode of their life on paper is cathartic. Well: but then, why in Hollywood everyone felt that this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.
