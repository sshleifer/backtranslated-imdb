Lorne Michaels proves once again that he has absolutely no activity as a film producer. <br /> <br /> One could think that after such sad films "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads", begins to get the idea that maybe he does not know what he does when it comes to movies (and many will even say he does not know what he does when it comes to television). Trying to make feature films out of sketches that did not welcome the third time they were made on SNL makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like Tim Meadows and I think it would be great in the good movie. . It's a pity to see a talented man lost in a film that staged unusual situations, and that ends with a scene of songs and dances terribly bad. All the laughs here will be due to the fact that the movie is so bad, and not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have movies about them. . It's just a shame that this one has gone to the big screen.
