Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben Stiller anymore. How this man is allowed to make movies overtakes me. I can not understand how this happens if I play at work as he plays in a movie that would kick me and own the company ... I should fire myself. GOD! This movie was just a smoky and stinking OOP pile, which should be sprayed if possible. Another thing, I must say that the guideline regarding the 10 lines of text in a comment is silly. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a brief novel while a brief comment is sometimes enough.
