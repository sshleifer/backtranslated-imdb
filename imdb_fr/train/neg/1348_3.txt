This animated movie Inspector Gadget is rather lame.The story is very weak and there is little action. Most characters have almost nothing to do. The film is at best quite entertaining, but really does not go where is useless. it is watchable but fair and does not match the caliber of the animated television series of the 80s. This is not a film that deserves to be rebroadcast, at least in my mind. It only takes about 74 minutes, including credits, so I guess. this is a good thing. unlike the TV show, the characters are not worth rooting here. in the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the situation, but who really cares? Well, it's just my opinion. For me, Inspector Gadget's latest deal is disappointing 3/10
