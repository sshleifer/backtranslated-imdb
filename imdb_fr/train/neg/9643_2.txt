Below average film with a mediocre music if we consider a film based on music ??? Ordinary Script & Direction with lots of gaffes. Salman Khan was at his usual acting act. Ajay's performances deteriorate over time, his appearance, especially his rock star styles, being pathetic. Asin was only a centerpiece. Overall, I wanted to waste my money at the movies. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were a lot of songs in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the British music sponsor was very impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be very easily understood by an English music sponsor. The other film I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which was a slow love affair, with good direction and acting despite some average music.
