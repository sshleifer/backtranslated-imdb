Most of the French films I saw - and that I liked - were more meaningful than real, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at one point, I wondered if Gerald Depardieu figured in all the French films ever made! It seemed like that.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting images and has a good opening . But then it became conversation, conversation and more conversation ... which is good for a drama but not for a mystery murder. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching this. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie was more like a play with almost every scene played in a room. So, if you like games, you should like that ... but I want a little more for a murder story.
