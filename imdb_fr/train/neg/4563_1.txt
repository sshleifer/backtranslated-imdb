This movie is perhaps the cheapest, the most expensive and the poorest suite ever made. <br /> <br /> Still, this is Disney's funniest and craziest movie, it will guarantee you laughter and lame stories from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This is a group of news that seem to be bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first concerns Beast and Belle who are thin in the face of a pathetic discussion. Then, three new losing characters decide to arrange everything by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Midway of this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my brother and my sister and I laugh so much. Then she and the Beast argue more for the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, it's all about the fact that Light is the biggest dope in the world in romance. This comes from the man who could woo anything woman. And they make FiFi a nasty psychotic who tries to kill Belle and ends up getting by without any scotch at the end. What message to send to children! <br /> <br /> Next, the next one is about Mrs. Potts' anxiety. And the next after all, Beast becomes too possessive of a bird, to the point that it seems downright silly. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 errors that you can clearly see ... and the coloring is awful. <br /> <br /> Beautiful is a light sap that chatters whenever something is wrong. In addition, she is petty and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the secondary characters are boring ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere quarrel almost all the time, I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated .) <br /> <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is ruined in that. I can not even describe it. Buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1/10 for sap, but I give him a 10/10 for comedy.
