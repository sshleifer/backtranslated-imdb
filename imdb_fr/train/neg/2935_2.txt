(Note: 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our What-To-See-Next blog for more details on our scoring system.) <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that will make your head brush against you - even an attempt to win the release of boredom on the screen. <br /> <br /> You do not wring your hands, you will not roll your eyes and you will not sigh in your popcorn. No indeed. For a film of this average average, it is enough to scratch your face. <br /> <br /> When you start scratching your own face, you have to start! - Start at the bottom. You will need your upper part, with its practical tear ducts, intact for the truly heartbreaking third act that can bring you to your knees if you have not yet managed to get away from all the theater. <br /> <br /> On the occasion of a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as a new benchmark in foreign leadership and diplomacy, a film of this boredom will be welcomed as one thing that all the world could create. * Looking at it *, however, is a much more dangerous undertaking. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth-level entertainment and celebrity magazine is about to see his magazine disappear . He needs a miracle. He receives a phone call from New York, United States. <br /> <br /> Sharp magazine editor Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) said, "Come work for me!" while his own employees use the fax machine in his apartment / office at the back it is obvious that "yes" is obvious. <br /> <br /> Soon, Sidney is at work in New York and doing all the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking the Broadway musical directors whether they are (1) Jewish and (2) homosexuals. <br /> <br /> He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the most popular movie star in the industry, when she leaves him in the magazine's office during a working lunch. <br /> <br /> It's a black dot good luck for everyone, because among other things, Sidney imagines being in love with Maes before waking up with the character of Dunst. <br /> <br /> Worse still, it totally alienates Alison Olsen (played by scripting-confusion of Kristen Dunst), a colleague charged to show him the strings of the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (Of course, we went to a movie before and so we know how this relationship will end, which is why we need intact tear ducts for the third act of the movie.) <br /> <br /> The The problem with The Thing is that the script is never really fucked, with the exception of the unique piece in which a tear duct takes place in which True Love reigns. <br /> <br /> The publisher Harding is supposed to be a son of god -bitch who also wants to throw everything away. However, the script never resists on either side of this dichotomy, and Bridges must let it bend and move in the breeze. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen is supposed to scorn Sidney Young. approaching her (as he does constantly), she wants to make him talk, instead of trying to discourage her, <br /> <br /> The "comedy" of the first scenes revolves around a pig destroying an expensive hotel room, then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the high heels of a celebrity during a cocktail party. <br /> <br /> Hot star Maes admits she is attracted to Young because he is "hurt". "The character never shows us * why * he's hurt, though." This is yet another consequence of the film's lethally wounded scenario. <br /> <br /> At one hour and fifty minutes, This Thing is longer ( and more deadly) than the retreat of Napoleon from Moscow.It is without interest, without hope, without possibility of redemption and even not profitable.
