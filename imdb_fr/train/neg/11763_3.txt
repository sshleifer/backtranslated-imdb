Yes. I'll admit it. I believed in the hype surrounding this work, about the trials and tribulations of six people living in Mexico City about their sex life. And so, I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie (at the time) popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie was totally disappointing. The story presents two couples with very obvious marital problems. When a third party enters the life of each couple, their problems reach a pivot point. Or absolute absurd. The plot is transformed into a battle of the sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is obviously stupid and childish (I guess humor was supposed to be there). And everything goes from bad to worse. Performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr. Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his prima opera. However, the dark circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (even stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc., make the film fail. Miserably. SPyL had a (awesome) reception at the box office. Believe the hype at your own risk.
