A truly terrible co-production between Rosanna Arquette and an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few years before the "gesture" where the child murdered her father and mother took the fall for the offspring. Now she has moved to the northwestern United States, but her child still has a problem in that she is devoted to her mother. So dedicated that it kills anyone who might be perceived as a threat to their bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (the girl) kills more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie, though the incoherent script, the useless direction and the dreadful music (Look at the saxophone the first time she shows her body in a bikini) does not help; we are supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both counts. Almost not at all attractive and not bad enough to be fun (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer are not really convinced as mother and daughter), all our condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both very much worthy of this , and both (especially Rosanna) are the only valid reasons for anyone to get through this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three hours "Love, Lies And Murder" (from Two Short Productions) has he had such a credit " You have to joke.
