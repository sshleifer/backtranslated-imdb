It's the most boring and boring shit I've ever lost an hour of my life. All I can say is thanks to God that it's only one hour More than half of this "movie" is made up of footage from the original "Criminally Insane". At the very least, I've been able to see the highlights of this rare classic of exploitation, because, for some reason, my video store only has "Criminally Insane II" (as it had, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is one of the worst movies you'll ever see. Why does my video store have this and not the original? Why does this stuff end up in video stores? Why do people praise and burn it immediately once they see its horror? Why - AUAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> Unless you like to see troublesome fruits eating an entire chocolate bar in an extremely slow scene, or that these fruits are hanging at the banister of the stairs in an even slower stage , or a character who is stabbed aside (do not ask) repeatedly in the back, or murderous monologues on brain cells about giving poisoned tea to his wife and then complaining delayed to eating from fly soup, or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: do not watch this movie. Repeat: do not watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not go past a bookshelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
