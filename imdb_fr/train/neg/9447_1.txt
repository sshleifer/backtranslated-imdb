Most movies allow me to sit easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I'm the kind of person who recognizes big movies even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand watching. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is good (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he's REALLY annoying). The idiotic songs the cat sang were boring and monotonous, even for the children of the audience. The plot is dropping and viewers must suffer from poor dialogue. Parental "spiritual" remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember a horrible comment about a garden hoe compared to, well, a type of person called a "ho"). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last forever. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If children can not stand it, I do not know how adults can do it. I would like to talk more about this movie but I do not even want to waste more time writing this review about it. I HATED! In summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever given to a movie.
