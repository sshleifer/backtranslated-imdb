SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's like watching a sketch on SNL are a bit silly. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy does his best and people think he's funny. <br /> <br /> Danny McBride and Bill Hader were the only fun characters in the movie. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool area. <br /> <br /> They could have improved the "Quiet Place" if they had not done the scene that falls three scary minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he pronounces his H is delayed. They try to follow him too long and half of the time, it looks like Andy laughs while playing, he's a horrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for simple-minded people with the brain of a 10-year comedy level. Which is about half of the United States.
