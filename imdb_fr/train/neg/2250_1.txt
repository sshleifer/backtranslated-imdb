Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) makes singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) a star overnight. Esther's star rises as John's star collapses due to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John makes the self-destruct-red-convertible-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take her seriously as a rising star when she's already a star. The very first time she appears, singing in a bar in the alley, she looks like a star of the well-established song that spends the night at the zoo, not a struggling stranger trying to start her career as a singer. She is too confident, too professional. His apartment looks like a page from "Apartment Living", not a troubled apartment in which a real singer would live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson takes care of himself - the role of rock star as ... good, like a singer who tries to become an actor but does not have much acting talent . The staging is lukewarm, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, the lame direction, or the slow story. It's the hair! After watching Kristofferson and Streisand's awful 70s hairstyles for more than 2 hours, your eyes hurt.
