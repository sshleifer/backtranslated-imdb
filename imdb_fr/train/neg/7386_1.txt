I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die during the shooting and the studio had to double the sound with someone who does not even look like him? Or was the DVD sound destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the real voice of the actor. Although, during most of the film, the sound was recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give a copy of this film to Goodwill, if I had one. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before renting other movies, which were all (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie. I guess it's not anymore.
