The author of the book, of the same title, should not have let his name be used for this film. if you have read the book, this film adopts such a liberal interpretation of the events and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have very little in common, except for the title and some superficial details. the film adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only does the plot advance at an incredibly slow pace, but it offers nothing more as it moves slowly (like character development, for example). Some viewers might be entertained by some lesbian graphic love scenes later in the film, but you can also watch a special show for the show they are presenting in these and isabelle - it is rather docile and unimaginative.
