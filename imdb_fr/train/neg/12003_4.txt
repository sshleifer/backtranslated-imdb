Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty spectators in the movie theater. Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I sit somewhere between them and I look at the center of the screen to find out what's happening in the movie. All the stories are not related to each other, but Nikhil Advani tries to show a relationship between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review, but after 3 hours and 15 minutes, I did not find anything to write. The film is a bad copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a good movie.
