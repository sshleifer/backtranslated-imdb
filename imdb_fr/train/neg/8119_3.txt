First of all, nothing in this movie really caught me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, it was nothing special" after seeing it. There was probably drama and stuff, but it just did not catch me, but more half-dull whistle. As I said in the title, it seemed very economical. The quality of the film itself (the pictures) was like a mediocre quality and reminded me more of a movie made for cheap TV than a highly respected English filmmaker. The angles of view and the shots were very amateurish, in my opinion. Did not really have close-ups or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I have not seen a lot of English movies and those I've seen do not impress me anymore and they look a little like the same with camera work, colors, and so on. "Game" tried to be cooler, trendy and smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about it if you wish), but did not succeed for me either. Overall, it's just a little indifferent movie that was nothing special (at best, I'm afraid) and unfortunately unfortunately more than two hours lost.
