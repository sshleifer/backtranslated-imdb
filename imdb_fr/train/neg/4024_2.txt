This movie is just terrible. Poor John Savage had to bend so low to be in another movie. He is portrayed as a rare type of vampire: helping a woman who looks like a washed out prostitute and thrown into the street who is a dancer at a local strip club. She accidentally tasted a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those few vampires as they gobble up on the floor of the locker room. Savage is then assigned by a small leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen's purple-haired twins. This film is simply crazy with Savage who strikes and dances with a dwarf with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the few. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This is only rediculas. And then, the rudest special effects they could get are Corri who will lift her organs and pull them out of her mouth. And you can say that all this is wrong. His son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more of a parasite than an object of serenity. I appreciate a good vampire movie, believe me, but I hated it. Even the photograph stinks, blurred and disappears with the camera rocking this way and trying to give the impression that the vampires move too fast for the camera to follow, then the camera becomes all bright in the scene where Savage pursues the wires . from Corri around until he goes blind. Avoid this one !!
