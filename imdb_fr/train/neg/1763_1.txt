It's one of the worst movies ever made. Banal. Predictable. Dish. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has scored a point is some beautiful scenes featuring Barcelona. I imagine they would use movies like this one at Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA jail to torture the suspects. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies have features that redeem everything, it has nothing. If I worked or worked there, I would change my name. Really shit. Hard to write more than that, but I feel that movie watchers around the world need a head on it. On the other hand, it will make a great gift to people you will not tolerate. <br /> <br /> You can send it to politicians you do not like, to the laws, to ex-women, to teachers you hate, to former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and a crowd others.
