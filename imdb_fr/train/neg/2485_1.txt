A film like Bulletproof has only one use: it reminds you how bad the worst can be. We often see movies that we describe as "pretty awful" or "not really good", but then you see a movie like this and you can see that even if all the other movies are not "good", they do not are not as bad stinks as Bulletproof. It was a birthday present from someone who spent less than two seconds searching through the big box of DVDs at our big box store to fulfill his obligation (ie to give me a gift). It could have been a chance discovery but it was not the case: it's so clich√©, so badly written, so badly directed, so badly played that I am surprised that all the people involved have not been arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's awful. I had suspected it for about 30 seconds, but I continued because sometimes - sometimes - the bad movies are so bad that they can be nice. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it in the trash.
