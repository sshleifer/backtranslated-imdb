The only way you can take advantage of this film is to bang your head against the wall, to allow some internal hemorrhages of the brain, to let a group of your brain cells die, and once you are officially mentally retarded, maybe you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only story that saves is the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of taxi driver, as was the British girl. Maybe if they had created the whole movie during their escapades in India, the way they would have fallen in love would have made a much more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a rating of 3 is because of Govida and his ability as an actor in comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. Moreover, the meeting scene at Heathrow was too difficult to digest. As an international traveler in the post-9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have been shot at even before he reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But again, the goal of the film was to challenge logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the public * GENERAL *. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. At least I know that I was scarred for life :(
