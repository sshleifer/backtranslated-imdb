Supernatural, boring and incoherent "Thriller" in which Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), a student, is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident cost the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not begin to tell you how bad it is ... nothing important never happens and there is never any real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this movie in particular - they are all sadly unconvincing (again, their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the fears? There is no sense or suspense - there are some good songs but that's about it. <br /> <br /> How did this project get the go-ahead? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that I can feel. Worse than anything, the conclusion makes the film totally useless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "deadly cut" that I watched is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
