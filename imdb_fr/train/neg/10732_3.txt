The Russian film "4" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a neighborhood bar. One is a musician, the other is a frozen meat seller and the other is a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4", it is thought, is intended to highlight the sadness and desperation of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have invented stories to make their lives more interesting that they are really), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I doubt very much that many people will be able to follow it thoroughly. There seems to be a suggestion in the film that the dark Russian government is performing shady acts behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling frozen meat dating back several decades, and so on. - but the film is so informal and incomprehensible that I doubt Everyone can understand what there really is to do here. <br /> <br /> Despite a decent action game and some incisive scenes, "4" is a two hour endurance contest that must be avoided at all costs.
