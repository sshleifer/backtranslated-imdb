I ended up watching this movie (very long) because I was fascinated by its stupidity and naivety. It seems hard to believe that so many personalities (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) have voluntarily participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people were really * so * naive? The plot seems written by a Latin American Marxist priest confused with an agenda. There is a conflict of superpowers and the Russians are actually the good guys. The secretary general of the Communist Party is a strong and spiritual man who, suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to appease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner. Priest of a Siberian gulag. The priest then quickly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the Vatican's secret ballot voting process, presented in the most pious form you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Chinese Communists realized the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their population. country to death. To solve this small problem on the unrelenting path to communism, they want to unleash a nuclear war (in order to fairly distribute Western capitalist wealth to China's working poor). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade General The secretary worries a little and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to negotiate peace. They meet fellow Chinese leader Peng, who looks and behaves like a 15-year-old boy. You will laugh on the ground thinking of what the Chinese thought in 1968. Comrade Peng asks Western capitalists to pay (which is quite logical, capitalists must not always pay for the madness of the Socialists?) And that the Pope must also sacrifice something for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the pope will be crowned in Rome, he will promise all the wealth of the Catholic Church in the world to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ. And so, he saves the world from the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, there are also some minor minor intrigues, which, alas, hardly allow to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give him three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks unlikely as a pope. He is much more plausible than Zorba the Greek.
