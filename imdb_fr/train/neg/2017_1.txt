The plot is plausible but banal, that is to say that the beautiful and neglected woman of a rich and powerful man throws herself with a psychotic piece, then she tries to hide it while the psychopath makes her sing . But, what develops from there is incredibly illogical. Despite the resources available to the usual couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have only one servant, their lawyer and the local police (who say they can not do anything), so that they are struggling with suspense terror. They do not have private security personnel (only a sophisticated security system that they do not handle well), house or field staff, drivers, etc. Not even, apparently, funds to hire private nurses 24/7 to heal the hero when he suffers mortal wounds, leaving husband and wife alone and vulnerable in their home. Our heroine is described as having the brain of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most improbable and irrational way. The production is an insult to the viewers who lost their time with this film and a crime for wasting the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting his audience's intelligence for this tasteless offer.
