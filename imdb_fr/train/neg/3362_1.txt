The Haunting is yet another horror remake with exaggerated dummy special effects and a large selection of on-screen favorites and has no quality that redeems them, with the possible exception of cinematography. I suppose the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring conspiracy, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to frighten his audience, but it's a movie and not a tabloid does not care about who we hold characters and history, two things that this movie has missed.The narrative is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and tearing up four chapters and then using all that's left for the movie, it's so boring. and a large part is unexplained. The characters are rather skinny and although the game is good, you do not care at all characters. Lily Taylor gives a terrible performance and sounds as if she was 8 years old She is old when she delivers her lines without mentioning her horrible screamer. Lily Taylor is not at all made for the kind of horror. The ghosts are stupid and nerdy, they look like a Casper group The Friendly Ghost and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as a mower for Halloween with a smoke machine.There's this creature on the roof of the one of the pieces that has a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny, but just sad.The house is beautiful and well designed, it's probably the only positive thing about this movie: it looks nice but it does not save. It's honest. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV at no cost. So I would have been even more pi $ ed if I had paid to see it, but luckily it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad effects, a bad attempt horror.
