I rarely comment on the films but I read the other reviews and I can not believe that there are people who applaud celluloid waste. I know that some people have their own agenda, but let's take it on merit; badly played, poorly shot and the story was felt as the director told it as and when. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving young children, because the filmmakers of course knew what they wanted and what their audience would like. All I can say is a terrible movie, the content is mediocre and offensive, the production is amateurish and I'm glad they could not make such a film legally today.
