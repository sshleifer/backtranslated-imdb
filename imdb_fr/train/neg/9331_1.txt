Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and totally devoid of logic. It's a typical DVD / TV film that contains all the ingredients necessary for an awful cinematic experience: the actors have been over-recorded, the side margins of the plot are unexplained, why?), People do not react to things as they would in real life. I will not even bother you with details, it will take all night. Well, all right, just one: if two people were murdered in front of you as you walked down the street, one of the victims practically died in your arms, his blood spurting from his head wound, that would be your first concern; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts are with Harvey and his lost career.
