Hollywood has always had a hard time accepting a "religious image". Strange Cargo is no exception. Although implementing the talents of a superb cast and produced with a very high budget, with photographs of Robert Planck who are in a bad mood, the film fails miserably on the credibility score. The reason is perhaps that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantastic elements thwarts the spectator's participation in the action and fate of the characters. I struggled to stand still in front of all the artificial metaphors, biblical parallels and references, and could not accept Ian Hunter's insipid know-how bathing in the light as a figure of Christ.

He flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the film had a kind of awakening on television. A family atmosphere seems to make the film's allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this strange cargo follows predictable lines and very moralistic that will not let anyone guess how the main characters will manage to face their fate.
