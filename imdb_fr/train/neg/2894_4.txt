I admit that the problem I have with the very famous Ealing films that I have seen so far could be mine. For my taste, they are black and a funny joke, or a tone so light that they are not satisfactory as comedies or stories. It's a very important way of saying that I wanted to like "The Man in the White Shirt", but I had a hard time sitting in the short period of time. <br /> <br /> The textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be modest, but he resolutely committed to progress in the form of attempts to invent a strip of cloth that can not be broken or dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest experience, he works against material and human limitations - the latter being the bosses of sleepy mills who do not understand what he is doing, then discover it and pledge even more to stop it. . "It's small spirits like yours that hinder progress," Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he has trouble telling the man. <br /> <br /> A problem with "Man In The White Suit" is that Sidney's vision of progress is terribly small, too, and even more so than bosses or workers who want it. work. My problem is more basic: for a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny. This is a rather serious scenario that tries too often to exploit his weak attempts at humor by taking, taking, taking, taking triple and taking vertigo. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine. Sidney is working hard to go "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" constantly and look for strange looks from each visitor until Sidney retrieves his miracle or explodes it while trying. Like all the other sides of wandering humor that work decently in this film, he has looked too long at him. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness so moving in a film, even if it looks incredibly young and serious (although in fact in its mid-thirties). He seems so bloodless, even more than the wax-faced general in which he played in "Doctor Zhivago". He is the same cold fish, that he ignores the sad affection of the touching mill girl who offers to save him money if he loses his job. (Hope Vida pan-faced as Bertha) or the more sensual charms of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), her true ally in her fight against "misery and dirt", as she says, making those words too incredibly sexy as possible. Only Greenwood players could do it. <br /> <br /> Extra players make sure that "White Suit" works as well. Ernest Thesinger of "Bride Of Frankenstein" plays a singularly naughty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu and laughs like a rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory manager is as memorable here as he played with a medical officer blinded in Lawrence of Arabia. Then there is the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her moments in front of the camera just under all the others. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so straight that you would not believe the director Alexander Mackendrick had previously worked on a comedy before (his previous comedy Ealing "Whiskey Galore" does not reverse this impression , alas). Roger MacDougall's play poses the notion of scientific progress as a potential disaster, but fails to present boring Sidney in a most agreeable light. <br /> <br /> We remember Ealing's comedies for capturing the human side of comedy. Yet the Ealings I've seen never seem to do it, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, go figure) are classics that way. "White Suit", on the other hand, is a useless hike that falls apart when it should coexist, just like this unfortunate suit.
