It is a dry and sterile film filming one of the most interesting events of the Second World War and the history of the war behind the front. The bad dramatic composition is worse in this film while the plot about Hitler's murder is supposed to be a pretty dramatic event. There is no character development and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play the role of a senior commander questioning his deepest thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely crazy. I think Mister Bin would play better. In general, the film looks very much like a good copy of the good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but can not approach this film with regard to any aspect of the film. However, the film obviously has the financial objective of reaching a popcorn audience that cherishes the Hollywood blood and the superficial artistic values ​​of Hollywood.
