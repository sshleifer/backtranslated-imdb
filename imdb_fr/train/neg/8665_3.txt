This is a horror / creature film by Roger Corman on a budget. A DinoCroc is created during the manipulation of prehistoric genes. A crocodile of engineering kills one of his own first, then takes the taste of the man and becomes a growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have depth, but then they are not the focal point. We only have a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best scenes of "killing" in a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is that of a moron figure who tries to use three dog paws as bait and becomes food croc himself. There is nothing left on the pier except the upper feet of the ankle. Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier do not really stand out. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an unpleasant professional crocodile hunter, Costas Mandylor. I was particularly impressed by the seductive Joanna Pacula, while Dr. P. DINOCROC feared respectfully to buy a feast of pickles.
