I think I have seen this kind of thing before: Graduates do not realize that they really do, while complaining that their lives are zero. <br /> <br /> This film is very derived from the movie The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can say: they have almost the same plot. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this snoring party, it was music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but again, I was expecting nothing less. This film was made by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another film that should only be watched blindfolded. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the verdict: it's a 1 in 10.
