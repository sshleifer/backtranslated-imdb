BE WARNED. This movie is such a mess. It's a catastrophe. Do not waste your time with this one. I warned you! <br /> <br /> The acting, the story, the dialogues, the music ... basically, everything is at its height, it's absolutely boring and ridiculous. It made me want to throw up (if the dialogue / the act / the story did not do it, everyone was shot down). You will feel like watching a comedy. The problem is that the supposedly funny parts are not even funny. The acting, the story, the cinematography, you can feel that everything is too difficult in WAAAAY - but it never succeeds. Virtually every shot is tilted, but so what ?! This film looks like a student movie. It's no wonder that they shoot this movie in HD because spending more money on this movie would be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> If you're having fun or playing, writing, editing, directing, clich√©s, anything imposed on you, oh, did I talk about bad acting? ? (Well, actually, it's not quite the actor's fault - it's the director!) so I guess you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to watch it during a class. I would have extinguished it immediately if I could. If you still can not tell now, I hated this movie. It made me want to throw up and get my time back ... at least I did not have to pay for this waste. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the type of Jurassic Park / Independence Day is part of this film, but of course it has fallen into disuse, accepting roles for movies like this one.
