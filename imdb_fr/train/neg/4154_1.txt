Vampires Vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Naughty semi-vampires and two zombies get hit by cars: special appearances of Bob the lesbian Gypsie-Witch and his dog, Random Woman with powers Special and Catholic school Choral zombie girl short skirt. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: no scenario. Only the writer and the director will understand the end, or anything else in this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I like bad movies. I love vampires. I like zombies. Hell, I even like lesbians. This film combined the three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, a dreadful dialogue (I mean really bad), and random characters and people who have nothing to do with ... knowing what was going on in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the "Zombies" with green oats in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not even cover their Zombies hands with paint on them. oats). Anyway, the result was this extremely bad movie, if you could call it that. <br /> <br /> Did the supposed end have no meaning? The vampire was really a nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Undead? Damn, where were the vampires? You could not really call any of the girls' vampires. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're REALLY curious ... OK, I'll understand. Seriously, even fans of bad movies will not be able to support this one. It should be number 1 out of the last 100.
