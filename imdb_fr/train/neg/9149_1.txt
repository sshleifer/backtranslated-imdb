There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows any talent. Nobody had ever tried to act before, even the extras of the coffee seemed to have been stuck. Nothing seems repeated. The quality of the film is terrible. Most "actions" take place in narrow corridors or in apartments, after which the cameraman is caught unawares, swinging a cheapo camera back and forth between the "actors" as they deliver their lines. No tripod and no suitable microphone either, the sound quality is terrible. Even "Manos" does better than that, at least they had the necessary equipment. The plot that there is is simply lost in the waste of production. <br /> <br /> Stay true to personal videos, preferably made by a 5-year-old kid trying out the video feature on Dad's new camera phone. You will do a lot of research to find a more inept film than that.
