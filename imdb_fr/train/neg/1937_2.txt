The first half-hour of this film pleased me. The obvious incipient romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was pretty to look at and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action went to Ingrid's fiance, everything went completely down. Instead of romance and charm, we see emerge highly spiked parallel characters that ruin the film. The rude son of the fianc√©e and the military attache trying to get the attention of the housekeeper looked stupid - a bit like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to modesty surpasses me This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to reclaim the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, because the film is very similar once the action passes in the rural domain (as in the other movie). I was not a big fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HIS MEN made me appreciate the artistic talent and nuances of the original film.
