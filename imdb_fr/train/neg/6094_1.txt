I have been widely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen 2) Unless you get more critics, it will not be on the list of the worst movies of all time - which deserves to be 3) I was lucky - I paid five pounds for that. I saw it in the stores for 15 pounds. DO NOT PAY MUCH FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry 4) There are many horror movies that are not rated enough (in my opinion) and give this movie a higher rating than they are criminal. > <br /> Summary of the plot: a guy without friends meets a hobo who promises to the world - finally, the magic ability to appear to everyone, in the image of someone else. Our hero skillfully turns into a teenager and joins their gang - sitting on swings, babysitting. He kills them one by one until he is found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? For starters, the acting is very bad. Someone else compared it to a school production. No, it's worse than any acting game I've seen on a school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought a number of these previously banned movies at the vipco DVD company and I was not as disappointed as I was at that. ok, the acting is bad but the film fails to give in every way. What was the purpose of making this movie when there is not even a gore! ok, no gore. What else can a film like this offer? Sweats? No, not even a titillation! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film may have a certain charm, but any potential buyer / observer of this film should be wise enough that this film is worth, at best, its value. only one in ten.
