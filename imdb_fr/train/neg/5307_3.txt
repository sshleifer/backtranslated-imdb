What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead, it collapsed with a scheming simplistic plot that made me want to stop looking. The film had only the brilliant talent of Meryl Streep, who did not deserve the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and truthful character that blossomed across the screen. <br /> <br /> However, no more than the brilliance of a screen legend could save this movie a descent. From the boring start, which had no power or punch, to an unconvincing end, the film was a real disappointment, especially since it offered considerable potential through its promotion and its trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring movie, which dragged on for too long, with too much discussion and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means worthy of the Oscars. (Especially since they have completely omitted performances like Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like looking at a cardboard box - as if it were simple and one-sided. It would have been more logical to name her for a Razzie, because I'm sure she would have left victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but its duration made me wonder whether the academy should really have given him his nomination. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films. from 2008. It was a movie mess with a lot of potential, and I do not recommend it. The only light that shines in the film is Meryl Streep, which gives an amazing and solid performance - does not even do enough to save this movie. *** / ten.
