I would have trusted my instinct better: no expectations, no disappointments. However, instead, I expected to experience a masterpiece similar to that of Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. In my humble opinion, Powaqqatsi is nothing more than an inexpensive attempt to take advantage of the cult success of its predecessor and, artistically, it fails miserably. It seems that a producer has collected the remains of Koyaanisqatsi, hastily assembled them, put them all idle and attracted a pop artist under the pseudonym Philip Glass to reunite hastily banal background, which is constantly repeated. When Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with fast, slow, intelligent motion changes, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of idle images (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me most, however, is the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not - and I still can not - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14 year old teenager on a Casio calculator, were the same composer who brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music of Koyaanisqatsi. In the end, a big waste of time! My advice: forget about commercialism! Look at Koyaanisqatsi instead!
