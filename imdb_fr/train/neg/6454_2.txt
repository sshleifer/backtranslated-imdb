The monster of Enemy Mine was somehow introduced into a small mountain community, where he settled. He is hunted down by a vigilante doctor who wants to exterminate him. This murderer, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, is riding a motorcycle and trying to save a group of kids who have chosen to live a Big Chill weekend in the middle of the monster's field. Decapitations and a lot of blood are mainly in place to divert attention from the unfortunate story like a bad version of Dr. Moreau's Island (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer).
