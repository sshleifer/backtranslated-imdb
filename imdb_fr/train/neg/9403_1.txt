This film should not be called cinema. Although he is more than 10 years old, he should never have received funding and is a scourge for the Australian film industry, which currently produces films as brilliant as "The Dish". <br /> <br /> The actors can not act, the music is .. be brutal, not music, the scenario is totally non-existent and is a struggle to get through. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It's a total waste of time.
