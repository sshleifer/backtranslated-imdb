This movie could have been a decent B movie if the 3/4 of the movie was not so centered on the sex scenes. I mean, he's an addict, and I'm sure there's a lot more going on with addicts outside of constant sex. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering all he had to do, which was not much. At one point or another, he should be mocked because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was well in her role as a sex therapist concerned, she could have done more and I do not suggest to him to have sex. The person who impressed me the most in this film is Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as loving and worried wife. There is something beautiful inside and out that attracts me strongly. She played that role and, watching the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict" is not Oscar material nor a modern classic, anyway, is informative enough and does a fair job showing you how his own demons can take control and ruin things in the life you hold.
