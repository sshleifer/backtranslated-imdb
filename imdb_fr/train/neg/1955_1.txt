This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch "Darkness Falls" actually and I thought it was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I made as fast as I could and I still could not get rid of those boring moments. I envy people who have been paid to play or work on this film. They actually got money for that shit. Is not it incredible? I mean in this film, a man is killed and cut in a wood mill in small bloody pieces and a few minutes later, the mother and the child calmly discuss at the table because nothing happened and drinks from coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such shitty movies? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was lame. Not scary at all and was obvious he was a bored stuntman dressed in a poorly made makeup.
