Imagine a woman alone in a house for forty-five minutes without anything happening. Then it goes on two more times. The writing is flat and lifeless, and the jokes are not funny, and the bad game prevents you from worrying about the characters, even when they fight with packs of wolves and get beaten by men of the fellowship . Anyone who ranks this movie higher than a two is not totally sane.
