This film begins by presenting a somewhat original idea but will later become a great frustration. What is the point of having an original beginning if the rest of the film has done little to avoid a clich√© plot? The film itself is very amazing. I would like to know exactly how a person gets into a clinic, takes a nurse's outfit, kills a doctor, takes a patient out of bed, puts it in his van and leaves? I guess no one could answer that question, so they just jumped on another stage hiding these little details. The performances are simply bad. The villain is just another "mad annoying antagonist", no depth, totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most scenes are incredible. It looked like they had been placed there, just for the 90 minutes, since they were totally useless. A doctor sees a woman clearly under strong medication, is prevented from examining her, is expelled from the house and just leaves alone? The scene that ended made me crazy to laugh, only Mickey Mouse could make it more realistic. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first time, say 10 minutes of film.
