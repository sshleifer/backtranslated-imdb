In 1967, the miners discovered the remains of an ancient, extinct civilization called Abkani who believe that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the door between these two worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad happened before the door was closed. 22 years ago, Office 713 of the Government Paranormal Research Agency was headed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who had conducted experiments on orphaned children. The paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just obtained an Abkani artifact in South America, is currently being pursued by a man of abilities. When an old friend of a foster family disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the head of Office 713, the Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team fight against the evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite a good charismatic cast, directed by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the World" "Dark" never works and is a complete mess, without character development or intrigue. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of the director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he declares that "the video games are the best-sellers of the younger generations who are no longer motivated by the book". In addition, its target audience would be people aged twelve to twenty-five. Sorry, but I find both statements disrespectful of younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know a lot of their friends and they are not that kind of stupid stereotype says the director. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics showing that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the dark" O Despertar do Mal "(" Alone in the dark? "The awakening of evil")
