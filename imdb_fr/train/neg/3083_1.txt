... Bad to be intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem has been projected directly on the big screen MST3k. Although it is obvious that the film does not seek to be taken seriously (hopefully, their goal, anyway ...), the film is still so bad. Damn, it gives Leprechaun In Space a big budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: paint my muscle because colored plum!
