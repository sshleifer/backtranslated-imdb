Life in a future fascist or quasi-fascist state, which severely restricts individual freedoms, is a recurring theme in modern literature and for filmmakers. Such work warns us against undesirable trends in our society to watch; but to be effective, they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective at displaying warnings than for entertaining us enough so that we can really read them; while with movies, the problem is usually the opposite. The first of these works to be known to all people is probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948). It is always available as a book or a movie. <br /> <br /> See or read it: and then, when you feel a little depressed by the inhumanity of man towards man, join Cinderella 2000. This is a movie comedy low budget very light based on the same theme that allows visualization without effort but without reward; and as in 1984, the calendar has now passed its old period. Most of the comedy is troweled, although there are only a few really fun moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between them, you can focus on whether this movie will gain a new life extension on DVD, or whether it will go into oblivion as the copies on existing band will deteriorate the repurchase past. There are a lot of the worst DVD movies these days, and frankly, I do not care what happens anyway. <br /> <br /> So far, the best of such films has probably been "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I'd be very happy to exchange them all for a well-done film from Jack London's grandiose novel, "The Iron Heel". As ambitious as it may be, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb lists only a black and white version made in Russia in 1919).
