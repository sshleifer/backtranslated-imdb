I read all the comments on this movie. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this film is based. The film is a fictional and abominable fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize it to <br /> <br /> alter small details or events for dramatic purposes; it's not a documentary. But the script modifies the impact, the reaction, the realities and the changes of EVERY main character. This greatly alters the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (who belittles <br /> <br /> Tibetan culture) to the gift of Harra's music box, to Harrar's change <br /> <br /> Heart, everything is wrong in this movie - except <br /> <br /> for amazing photography. I understand that the <br /> <br /> Potala (palace) shots were smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> change a real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them very important for this world, in order to build a <br /> < br movie star is sad
