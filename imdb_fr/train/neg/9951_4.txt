Johnny and Jeremy are vampires. Minus fangs, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures that have nothing better to do than spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a big wallet, respectively), they seduce desperate souls, which they then proceed to torment and victimize. This is more or less the foundation of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This is not a mix of dark humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the fishy public, the main character. However, I appreciated the sound and the melody of the quick remarks (and supposedly very spiritual). I was very impressed by the acting, especially that of David Thelis; only Jeremy's character seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, dramatic and dark, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What baffles me the most about "Naked" (and the main reason I never recommend it to anyone) is the way it seems to repeatedly portray misogyny as a way valid to release his anguish. In other words, in a world that fears so badly, what does it change if we make girls suffer, right? Suggest (like some on this website) that Johnny is not such a cruel person, because he is not as tough on girls as Jeremy, seems to me completely absurd. They are both terrible and mean. And they are especially keen to hurt women whenever they have the opportunity. It could be argued that Johnny ends up getting what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly came back to him and bit him in the ass. But all the same, the sadistic behavior of Jeremy and his friend is treated to a certain extent as a matter of laughter. And I could be wrong, but I guess most people who absolutely love this movie also find this aspect of the film dreadfully comical.
