"This" Malcom "show on FOX is doing a massacre ... can not we create our own version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts, we all know that's true, and that the only thing NBC added to the "Malcom" metric was sex. And then, did they add sex ... <br /> <br /> Tucker, 13, gets fucked and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters her aunt's shower and accuses her of looking at her and pushing her away. He sees the pretty girl in the next house from the window of her room and she knows he wants to see her naked but she teases him smiling and closing the window. And all of this is in the pilot project. <br /> <br /> Take this from an adult man - a boy's puberty is so crazy about sex and governed by testicles that it's impossible to make it funny for an ordinary audience. The only moments when someone has approached have been in the movies, and you can count them with one hand. So it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom. Does the network really think we would like to watch children struggle with puberty? Is not that what people go to prison? If you doubt the depravity of the show, consider this: 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented decision to "burn" the remaining episodes by airing them at MIDNIGHT so that no child could see them. Ironic since the kids were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to his general vagueness, Tucker offers a voiceover of the main character to expand the writing of poor quality. Even in 2000, he was horribly dated, with his accidental music and super-sarcasm. I could not love any of the characters enough to laugh jokes and the jokes did not come exactly to a minute ... Shame on NBC for this dirty scam ... they are better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
