I watched Phat Beach on the cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character because he seems to be a nice guy. The other characters are only various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget films that capture a period, as they almost look like a documentary about attitudes and fashions. Phat Beach is also fun because the budget girls of this movie are strictly girls at home. Most low-budget movies have this "local girl" quality, and you can tell the girls in this movie that it was JC Penneys' local strippers and underwear models. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging in their bikini that it was amusing to see how "young" people were raging in front of what was essentially a really overused and very kilometric skank. There were also cute ones. That's the charm of these shitty movies on a budget. You will see a lot of dogs and real cute ones! I checked some of them at IMDb and seven years later, Phat Beach is their only credit. Pity. It would be interesting if someone managed to make a book "Where are they now" on all the cute ones that have appeared in the history of cinema and would never come back again. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every film that seems to have a lot to do, and yet, years later, when you see the movie on TV, you wonder, "What happened to X? " Anyway, this movie blows mostly, but it has fun moments.
