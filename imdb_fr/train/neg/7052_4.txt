God this movie was so boring outside the music that I really liked, I mean what was the purpose of making this movie a movie that will please everyone who reads this review do not watch this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can play but was really pathetic. In this film, I'm ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another pretty face without any lack of talent whatsoever, she can not act at all and there was no point in her being in this movie, because for the other girl Radha, she was fine, but could have done better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. please buy good music and do not watch this movie.
