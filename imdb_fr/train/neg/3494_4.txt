Given its popularity, I found this film very disappointing. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie. After all, it's one of the best-known martial arts movies of the 1970s, but I never understood why. The story is without interest. It is also a very talkative movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story did not offer a character I could base on, because the intended hero is an idiot. The director Chang has no sense of style and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections of the story. I know it's not supposed to be great art, but I found the film boring. This is certainly not the best example of this beloved kind. His cult status escapes me. I recommend you skip it.
