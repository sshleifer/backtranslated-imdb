I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after watching it, I was really disappointed. The best part was when Stephen King was inside. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life, any more than others. Some performances even made me laugh! The movie was not as I imagined, after reading the book that was awesome, I imagined it darker and a lot more scary. If I were Stephen, I would be really angry! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you had just learned that the pie had killed your daughter, you would not offer it to anyone else !? <br /> <br /> The book was so much better!
