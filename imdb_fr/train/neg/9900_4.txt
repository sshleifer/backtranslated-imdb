I suppose that any novel as depressing as Moby Dick would find no favor with the public of the Depression era who was tired of their own problems. But any resemblance to Herman Melville's classic novel is pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is a precedent of the main story as we know it, it was not too conserved for the film. We meet Ahab Creely for the first time (he has a last name and a brother) while a happy soul has two legs and is trying to marry Joan Bennett, who is the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in a disproportionate performance. Barrymore had not yet mastered the sound cinema and he gave in with all the histrionics of the silent era plus a theatrical voice that would have shaken all the cinemas in which this film was taking place. his leg to the big whale Moby Dick and I must say that the amputation scene was pretty awful. Of course, all this was before the Code. Nevertheless, I am certain that the audience of 1930 shuddered. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of Ahab's whaling would make it unsightly to Joan Bennett. That's not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no female characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> Melville notably invested the money of the crew of Pequod, the ship of Ahab, with his personalities. Aside from Queequeg the cannibal harpooner, the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
