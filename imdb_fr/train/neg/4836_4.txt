Let's start with simple lines. On the spectator side, there are some good "director details", some views on the movie scenes that are cool. The special effects are pretty good, good acting / good landscape too. But the story is too simple. This shows how an elite unit of army bomb squads lives, acts and dies sometimes. This shows the drama of life at war. In my cinematic experience as an "addicted" type of serious action movie, I missed that click that sticks to my eyes and my head. One of the things that needs to be present in a movie so that I consider it a good one is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and the time of the film. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this film has earned its place in glory thanks to the "unconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and authentic feeling, but not the proper use as a generator movie fame. More than a movie about the war, its popularity continues to grow. <br /> <br /> A simple idea: if it was a film about World War II or World War I, only time could change, with all that remained the same, be this reward? Of course not. Why? Because there are some who raise the bar very high. <br /> <br /> Compared to his rivals at the Oscars, I do not think that all the prizes he has won are correctly awarded.
