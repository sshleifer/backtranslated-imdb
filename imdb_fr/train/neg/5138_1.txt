I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzzing around it. Well, I can not imagine anyone who likes this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the one who made this film knows nothing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two kinds: the action movie (guns and criminals) and the horror (live scarecrows). When criminals are killed one by one by scarecrows that look like pokys, the two genders automatically cancel each other out, first because they are criminals who care about criminals and then because they are stupid criminals! Making zombie scarecrows chasing them just does not work here. Where is the horror? I wanted criminals to die in horrible and painful deaths. <br /> <br /> But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if managed well, NEVER gels. We just have a group of very dense criminals and a group of scarecrows, who are "alive" for whatever reason the filmmakers have imagined. The fact that cinematography is appalling (as on TV) is even worse and that whole parts of the dialogue are told on circuit breakers, and we continually hear meaningless dialogues about disconnected images as if we were observing them somehow. radio program. This part was really BAD. The director should have been killed instantly for having such a stupid idea! I can not tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned, the criminals of SCARECROWS are incredibly stupid. For example, when someone comes suddenly, emptied and filled with money and straw (yes, straw) in his big open wound, the others ask him "What is the drug he takes?" after firing tons of bullets into him, unable to kill him (he was "zombiefied" by scarecrows - do not ask ...). Get a scary clue, morons. I have never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there is the girl. I would have liked that one of the scumbags killed her quickly because she had pain in her buttocks. When she finds her father nailed to a "cross" of scarecrow, she blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (misbehavior), even if the criminals could not have done it. What a fool she was! But scarecrows are the biggest weakness of this very weak film. They are not scary. We do not explain much to them. They are just a conspiracy device in this movie full of conspiracy devices. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds without interruption is just boring. And that scene with the head talking in the fridge. Thank you for the laughter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot in recent days!) Between the equally sad SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS I would rather watch SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS is so bad.
