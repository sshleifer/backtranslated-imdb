The film and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez plays well with Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that it's supposed to be a prequel to a hit movie. The manufacturers of this pre-sequence have clearly not looked at the original version of Carlito's Way or at least did not care about continuity. This film is a pre-sequence, which means that the original film has already established a story for us and that this film should end where the original begins or at least lead it. None of Carlito's old close friends made an appearance in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the film but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the previous, in 1969-1970. Since this movie took place less than 5 years ago, do not you think that one of Carlito's longtime friends would make an appearance? In the original, Carlito started to get out of prison after 5 years in prison. There are only a few months left between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know that since the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison. So, when the preamble gives us that happy ending in Hollywood, it's an insult to the fans' intelligence of the original. What's happening to Gail? It is the lack of continuity that pushed this film to go directly to the video output.
