And some other "no" on top of that. Voodoo Academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is he trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; as it has been pointed out, most people are barely legal and rub themselves. Is it then an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, perhaps, if not, it never goes beyond the most benign and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which, to everyone's delight, is repeated eighty thousand times.) It's a horror movie. is he trying to scare us? Not unless the director wanted to do it through the boredom and emptiness of his "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I loved a film so much. It's the most boring and useless thing I've ever seen. It's like Voodoo Academy takes horror movies, zombies and gay movies, puts them in a mill, then passes them through a coffee filter - instead of the type of coffee filter which filters the coffee beans, it's the kind that removes everything that is vital, nervous or interesting. The result is 74 minutes of film, as exciting as a glass of warm water, without the possibility of rehydrating after the 10-day gin frenzy that will inevitably happen to you if you look at this abomination of human effort.
