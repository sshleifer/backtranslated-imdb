Attracted enough by the erotic scenes, I realized that it was one of the most amateur and incredible films I have ever seen. A bit like a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking ?? And what was there with all these characters in this strange supposed Midwestern town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lesson to be learned, no brilliant idea, just scalded and ridiculous enough (but a lot of skin, if you are intrigued), nonsense filmed on video .... What was with the bisexual relationship, exit from nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters. And what was there in this absurd dance, where everyone played his stereotypical roles? Give it a pass is like a million miles of bad film, wasted film, money that could have been spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa .....
