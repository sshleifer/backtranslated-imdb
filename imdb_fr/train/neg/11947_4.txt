An interesting change from the first. There was more mystery in this film than in the first. Even when it ends, you wonder what happened to the killer. There are good parts in the movie, the first half starts slowly then the last half speeds up. All the movie is nice. The story goes that 22 years after the events of the first film, Norman Bates came out of the asylum and returned to the Bates Motel, but when a woman comes forward claiming to be his real mother, things go wrong. Perkins plays a good old Norman again and the scene at the end was excellent, he was rocking the spade.
