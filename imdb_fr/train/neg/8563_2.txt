It's like what the title of this thread says. The only impression I get from this movie is that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and pathetic. The first date of his character with the character of William Hurt where they danced was silly. Overall, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and in total I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this movie with intent ... to overcome my insomnia problem, because all it does is fall asleep. Sweet dream.
