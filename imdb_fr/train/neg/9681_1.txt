To borrow from Dorothy Parker: This film is not to be thrown lightly <br /> <br />. It should be launched with great strength. <br /> <br /> It's an awful mess. And I am a fan of Greenaway. <br /> <br /> The tiny and amazing spirit <br /> <br /> "The return of the mother" has much more artistic merit
