I saw him at the theater when he came out, and just yesterday, I saw him on a cable again. This allowed me to remember how revolting this film is. All the band of characters are self-absorbed narcissistic predators. Worse still, it reinforces every negative stereotype about dating more than 20 years, even if it is supposed to celebrate people "ending up". Cool guys finish last, jerking males look good, males more sober do better. The girls are all toy dolls for boys. We see only one character ("Wendy") doing something useful for society, and she dispenses with her virginity long kept in a disposable evening scene with a jerk in a scene lush that we are supposed to think to be romantic. This is actually the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, pretentious.
