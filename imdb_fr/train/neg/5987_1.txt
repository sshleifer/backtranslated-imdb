I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. A typical American plot, I'm sorry. Guy takes the kind of girl in the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? The Bank of England is what it really is !! - However, I liked the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the British were bad guys? (Except Parker and Lady Penelope) What was going on with that? Oh, and they kept saying "Here come 'The Thunderbirds" "- but it's never been called" The Thunderbirds "in the show, why do that? I'd like to see that redone in 20 years with more British cast, I preferred the original series.
