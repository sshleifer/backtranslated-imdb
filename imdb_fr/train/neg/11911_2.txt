I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, while keeping a close eye. I waited for the next special effect, or the next element of the plot ridiculously cliché to show all its strength, so that I can learn not to make a film. <br /> <br /> It seems they decided to do that. During the film, the team watched all the other action / science-fiction / shoot-em-up movies / good against evil, and saw some cool things and said, "Hey, we can do it . " For example, the only car parked in a one-kilometer radius on what appears to be a one-way road with a shoulder not intended for parking is the car on which the protagonist, a pretty brunette born of bile, is thrown . The car breaks before even landing. The special effects were obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what is really put in my bad books is the improbability and lack of reason of so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon capable of inflicting bizarre wrongs, strikes a single army truck carrying an important personality. Unarmed types of security with guns come out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says, "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He goes out to find the beast that killed his 3 friends, he gets banged on like a cliché almost comical. So, for no apparent reason, defying logic, conventions and common sense, the silly VIP ass KIND OF TRUCK !!! Much of what happened during the film was meaningless. The transparent cast of actors set me apart from the movie, as well as the bad camera work and things that made you go: "Wow, it's incredibly lame." Shiri Appleby saved the film from a 1 because it gave him the essential element that still allows viewers to enjoy the experience, sex appeal.
