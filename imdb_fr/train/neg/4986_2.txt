Everyone who wants to be a publisher should watch this movie! It shows you all the mistakes you can not make when editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason this movie is really bad! (In fact, it's so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence without an exclamation point!) If the first episode of "The Visitors" was a very good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel poorly copies the recipe of the first. Fun games could be counted on one hand and maybe half. Keyboard plays even more on his role than in the first part. Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because she replaces it) but it's "grotesque". Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny alone on stage, she is not in this movie because she does not act like she did before. I know it should be difficult to replace a person who was good in a role (Lemercier got a Caesar for her role in the first film) but she made a serious mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing it! As for history, it's too much! Of course, we knew at the end of the first movie that there would be a sequel, but Poir√© and Clavier should have tried to write a simpler story, like that of the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and already-seen. No, really, there are no more than 3 fun parts in this movie. The only good things could be the costumes and some special effects. So you have only two reasons to look at it: 1) if you want to learn how to make a film terribly, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a "brainless moment"! 2/10
