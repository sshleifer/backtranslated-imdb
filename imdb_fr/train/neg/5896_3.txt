A missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a mobile phone called "Pon". A missed call was as boring as that one. Maybe the phones are just not scary or something, but this movement was dull and dull. No tension or thrills for me, and the last monster was disappointing, cheesy and indifferent. The film dragged a bit in different parts and felt too long. I did not catch my attention. It seems that phones are hard to scare, it's a bit like trying to make a soft drink vending machine strange. And it's ridiculous to compare that with "The Ring", it seems that all Asian horror movies are compared and, to date, I've never seen a comparable one. To horror makers, pick up the phone as a horror device.
