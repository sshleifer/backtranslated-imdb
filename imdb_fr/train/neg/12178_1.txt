Annie's wig does not look good. she is not pretty and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie stands out in the movie, her clothes look like Halloween costumes. terrible actor and terrible intrigues. This film is a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and smaller girl should have been the main role. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie. Not at all attractive. At least the casting director was right with Daddy Warbucks. Ms. Hannigan was also taken at random. Camilla Belle played well at Molly. "Attention", this movie could insult your IQ and you will only want to show it to very young children. 8 years old and under. Some of the parcels are too fictitious and could hardly take place in the real world.
