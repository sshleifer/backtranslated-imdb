A horror story so common about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. This is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but it is too far removed from the Polish filmmaker's film in all its aspects. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" is not at all. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising about this film is the cast: it is full of big names in American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), experienced actors acting for food (I guess). <br /> <br /> Verdict: barely entertaining. <br /> <br /> * My vote: 4/10
