Okay, I was bored and I decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that made this film fall is that there would be an hour of footage, then about the same time, repeated 4 times. It consists of: 1. Gathering the troops and discussing the plan of attack, 2. Flashbacks to the men's wives 3. The approach of the troops marching on a long line 4. Men who run on a hill and shoot, usually the first shot in the head. then 3 other men rescuing him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call at the base to talk about success. 6. Men return to their wives and sing 10-minute songs. It was the basic movie, and this same sequence of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time he made a flashback to the women, he showed the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so it took a lot of time. Apart from that, men could only kill their enemy with bayonets or grenades. I loved the music and there was a lot of action, even though the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably would not see it again, but it was not too bad.
