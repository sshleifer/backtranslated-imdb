The Bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it's so misleading. It's not surprising that filmmakers are trying to mislead us because it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about a mysterious murder in a castle on an isolated island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupor, it is invariably an involuntary comedy in the form of an atrocious dialogue delivered by a voiceless group of vocal artists. These guys are so mean that they make the actors for whom they make their voices sound like a group of morons at the level of care. It's really hard to tell how bad the acting is when you've doubled that chasm. But vocal artists can not be blamed for the script. It's a travesty. Without wanting it funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, uneven. The female characters are particularly idiots; men are scary or tedious. <br /> <br /> The company as a whole feels the pure exploitation of the public. It does not keep its promises at bay and even when the murders (finally) begin to happen, they all happen off screen. All we get is a few half-hearted head shots. <br /> <br /> Some people said that this movie was a giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who loves Italian thrillers should give a lot of space to this film because there is nothing very exciting about it. It's basically a soft-core porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it to anyone.
