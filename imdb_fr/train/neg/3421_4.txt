STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** The Works **** It just misses the mark *** That little something between ** Trolling out * Pits <br /> <br /> Plutonium is gone and people Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his young and daring protégé Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous movie) with the help of Que, his adopted daughter, Josh (Jennifer Tung), now have the means to develop a bomb. They decided to stop them. <br /> <br /> It was another film that dealt with terrorism one year after the events of September 11th. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even later recounted how much the plot of the film was strangely similar to what had happened in downtown New York that day. There would be some who would have wanted a movie where Norris and his team kick a terrorist ass if nothing else. That aside, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever done. This leads you to wonder what the original justified for guaranteeing a sequel at first, and if one could make a man of President 3 soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a movie from Norris, you've seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected in this film, but at least you know what you're getting and, as I said, maybe that was just what some people needed to let off steam. **
