This movie is so bad, it made me want to throw up. Bad product, an area without complete laughter. Why, in the name of God, would you falsify a film that, to some extent, is a parody (and a damn funny additionally) as it stands? The sets are laughable, the effects so serious that they are not even comic. It's a complete mystery why you would even consider looking at this pile of garbage. National Lampoon has already made Animal House, which people still consider completely and completely hilarious. Now they have been relegated to making TV movies like this piece of ****. Quote your name, and it could be used with precision to describe this film.
