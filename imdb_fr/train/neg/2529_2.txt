Bobby is a clumsy kid who smiles a lot and wants sex. So he buys a pickup truck to help him in this quest. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the scenario is nothing more than a chain of clich√©s and thrills. The directors of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the madness of the other films of the time, but they are far from satisfied. They even use Bobby slipping on a banana peel, because that would add so-called comic value. <br /> <br /> I struggle to find a feature film that redeems the film. If you like DeVito, this is another type of classic role of DeVito - but it is only a support actor and it has the value of cliche.
