Nobody could like this movie for its merit, but if you have a sense of humor and like schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. He ranks here with "Road House" for his absurd characters, set and story. The bad writing really made me laugh: "I want you to dust these guys" instead of "... dust those guys." The F-14 take off from the aircraft carrier, but when they enter training, they are F-16! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, a few minutes earlier, was overseeing a hidden "fly" on Seagal. Segal lacks bullets and uses a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, the guards put down all their weapons and also fight with knives! The hand grenade is a failure but explodes anyway. The little stealthy fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then, Segal returns to California by road - the long way, that is to say by Europe - even if a carrier provides air support 20 minutes from the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black computers, 2 flat screen TVs and images of gauges and maps on the walls. What stupidity!
