1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by a German cameramen with the naive cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive footage, excerpts from international newsreels, and extracts from related cultural films. the Jews of the world as crooks and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A candid and unique cinematographic expression of racial hatred. Personally, I find this film scary and very offensive. One can only hope that such images will never reach the screen again.
