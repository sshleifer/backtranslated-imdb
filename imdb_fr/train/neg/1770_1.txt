My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly in the top ten of those I watched all along. At least "Plan 9" was nice. <br /> <br /> I really liked "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of her other films. I did not care about "Cujo" (only because the sound was so bad on the versions I saw and often I could not say what people were saying), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9 year old. (No offense to 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even the "one-liners" made us moan and were not distracting.
