I saw this opening weekend of the film in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the final story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was very thin ... which does not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were a few other positives, Edgerton's support in particular, Jordan's leadership (also confirming his talent in Buffalo Soldiers), and a conception of production that gave the Australian bush a real sense of harshness. Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can not help but think that another opportunity was missed to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or was it?) ... in what I suspect to be a Hollywood franchise and the sale of the image in the United States. Well, at least Jordan and the producers have not agreed to lose the beard just to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> I guess I'll have to settle for the excellent "Secret History" Kelly's "Peter Carey Gang" 4/10
