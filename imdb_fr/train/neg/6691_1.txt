MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, MAKE THIS FILM TO ME! on what medications are you people! it could very well be the worst movie of all time! I felt like I was always on a journey of acidification, I needed to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From beginning to end, Glow Ropes is an impious masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought about watching this movie with my best Jewish friend and his family, we thought, "Hey, it can be funny! It's probably going to be bad but still a little funny" how good we were in mistake, we were not prepared for the terrible film could be. All the friends lined up for the lobotomy at the end of the movie. During the film, one of my friends tried to hang himself with his belt, while another tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I would have liked to watch The Ring's video instead, so that the pain and suffering disappear in just seven days. For all those who wish to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! you may think that you are a bit of a "tough guy" in praising this, but this film will break you, push you to the ground and urge you to urinate.
