Was there only one positive to this film? Critics who did not know anything about video games could spot the mistakes. No damage taken with damage clearly visible at the beginning, which is a prime example. <br /> <br /> And maybe I missed something, but Super Mario Bros. Should not it be supposed to be a game that had never played before? Well, if that's the case, and nothing has escaped me ... how did the character of Fred Savage, and even the girl, already know as much about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know at the time of their second or third reading. <br /> <br /> In addition to factual errors and gaming errors, there is a poor overall quality of the film itself. Honestly, nothing is really unforgettable. The kid was not even very good at playing video games in the sequences he was showing. At the time, many children I knew were much more experienced. In addition to all this, the acting and the scenario are only mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the "Sorcerer" (the youngest child) is a very silent and completely dry child shot of a small child who almost never speaks because of a trauma. It's not that it's unrealistic, it's the fact that you have to start it in the movie to even begin to form a plot that would even exceed 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you'll appreciate it being good or not. These were children playing video games, and by the time you saw them, you were probably also obsessed with the NDA. But unless you love him as a child, nothing will detain you all the same, and very little will prevent you from extinguishing it. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I did not like it. .
