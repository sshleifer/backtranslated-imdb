I liked "American Movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first movie, which I also thought was a documentary. From the first minute, I saw that it was not the case, but I tried it. <br /> <br /> What a dead film. Being true to yourself will be of little use to you if you just look at the boredom, in particular. boredom with which we are already familiar. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but will it be like a relationship with ANYONE that 1) a lot of jobs are afraid and 2) most of them are miserable, minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew it before seeing the movie. Anyway, it did not really allow to examine the question because, while the film has a hard time feeling "real" (portable camera, no music, etc.), what happens is is hardly clearer than in the "real world". <br /> <br /> Would an employer be so happy with Randy when he takes his check, after Randy left him after 3 days, when the guy told him he was planning to let him stay 6 months? Or the day after the abandonment of his work (and the DIY of the machine he was working on), that everyone would be so easy with him ?? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he is stuck in these jobs, or has a shabby apartment, or looks like one. It's a dope. It does not pay attention or even do not really try these jobs. He has zero personty. If I had to hire someone, he would not do the interview. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see what Chris Smith will do next, but guys, stop the "that-is-a-" important movie. "" American Job "does not work.
