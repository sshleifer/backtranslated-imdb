I have two good things to say about this film: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialogue and direction). However, having said that, I found this film extremely tiring. Watching dry painting would have been more fun. It seemed a lot longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with the opening sequence, where everyone talks to each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything he says on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clich√©s and shtick, not to mention the incessant incidents of flatulence audible Falk. In addition, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. Some sequences are touching, but they are all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" attract you, you will love it. But if you were hoping for something more substantial, watch a different movie.
