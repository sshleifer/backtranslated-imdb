Frankly, I am rather furious that, given the excellent reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I lost almost two hours in his first offer. Have they all been written by his friends? The action slams, the music is irritating and too used, the scenario is simply terrible and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) at best mediocre. I think that we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but to say that it is great not to do it will surely encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, that is, to continue writing his own scenarios and use the same actors for another company. Yes, it's his first film, small budget, etc. - I understand it, but the public also finds it, it is not up to par.
