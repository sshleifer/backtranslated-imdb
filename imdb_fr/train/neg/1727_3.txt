We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with fins. Okay, let's call it THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". We also have a sheriff who does not really do something in this movie and nobody listens. Oh shit, we're halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! Do not worry, let's introduce a guy with a mustache, let him rob a shop to say he's a bad guy, then have him appear somewhere near the lake, have him go through the woods and all that in the only purpose is to have it finish as a dinosaur snack. It should work. <br /> <br /> A complete and clumsy mess, this film. His logic will twist your mind to force you to laugh. The first film to present Dave Allen as a "stop motion supervisor". After this one, he joined Charles Band for several years until the mid-90s, when Band exhausted his resources to pay for it, I suppose. The effects of dinosaurs are charming and the whole movie is damn funny without wanting it. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing we can say about it. <br /> <br /> The good bad guy? Yes. The hallucinatory logic of the narrative should be reason enough to put it on the list. Otherwise, Arnie and Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
