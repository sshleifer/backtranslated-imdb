After watching the premieres, I felt that this film would be a great improvement over this fast and furious series. So, I was already expecting a missing scenario, but at least this time, it will not be loaded with impotent civics with cans of fart. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a story worse than anything this movie has for you. <br /> <br /> It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm nice - no, I would not take my baseball bat like what others have said). Not only was the scenario non-existent, but the action was also crap. I imagine the director thought they could just run a group of exotic women and cars and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy presses the "Nos" button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a McLaren SLR to win. And after Eddy Griffin argues with one of his "girls" (a comment from Imus would work in this case), the girl asks to stop and get out of the plane and of course she done in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene, I could not take it anymore. So, I only saw half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I released. Then I had to stop a few drinks to kill all my brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to the local auto show and stop at a tape joint on your way home. I will keep all the viewers in my prayers.
