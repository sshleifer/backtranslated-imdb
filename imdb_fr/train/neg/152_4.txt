In the discussion, you may consider some facts as revealing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win an Oscar for this work and I think the Academy was right in that. vote. (Other Oscars for best nominations of actors and others ... I'm not aware of that, but it would be difficult to justify, given what they were asked to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this action is so artificial, so disturbing. While watching this film, a distinction made during an art and cinema class that I followed shouted at me: "Feeling is an honest emotion, honestly made, sentimentality is sweet and unreal, a false vision of life." It's exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life do two people begin to read aloud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed, examining Nettie's letters they found? There are examples of this type of fake behavior throughout the film: all the men who pile up around Miss Millie's car, then jump in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she s 'en va; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings on which he works (a cheap stick gag); the whole troop of party goers who went en masse from the Jook Joint to the chapel, as if delighted by the singing of the choir ... again and again. Nothing sounds right. I even wondered if the name of Harpo had been chosen on purpose, because it was the real name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah", in reverse. Spielberg is not above such "kindness". <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Spielberg is incapable of acting honestly, acting and emotionally. Schindler's list was incredible, deeply touching to me, and I admire the realism of Saving Private Ryan immensely, even if the story is a bit artificial.
