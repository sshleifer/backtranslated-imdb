I gave up trying to figure out which version of this movie I'm watching. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And although this is not the most important point of my objection to this film, I would say that watching a film made in the Aquarian era (including long-haired hippie chicks and odious train cars), but with The soundtrack of the 1980s synth is disturbing. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection is how do you dare filmmakers? BURY BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON, PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW DARE IT. <br /> <br /> Seriously, she's adorable and all but in the two movies I saw her - that crap and the excellent Legend of Hell House by the way - they kill her. <Br /> <br /> I would like to put the film industry on notice. Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from the company, but if she ever decides to shoot another film and one of the filmmakers complains about her murder, I will ask her to stand aside. <br /> <br /> Nobody gets bored. Pamela Franklin and go with her. I AM QUITE CROIX. THE FURY HAS BEEN RELEASED. <br /> <br /> For B-movie fans looking for a crapfest, you could do a lot worse. On the plus side, this is not a movie that involves Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this movie is a hardcore satanic movie. <br /> <br /> Satanic Wall Ceremonies, Baphomets, Hallucinations, Ridiculous Rat Attack - What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> This excellent thing is almost ruined by the confusing synth soundtrack of the 1980s, which is about as unbalanced as it is possible to be. The soundtrack reminded me of something you hear about The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, they forced Pamela Franklin to crush her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration. human rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive anything about this film if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the glove, gentlemen - ANYONE MESSENGER WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSAGE WITH ME. <br /> <br /> EVEN IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, Gentlemen.
