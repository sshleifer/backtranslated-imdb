I went to see this with my wife and my 3 year old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and me. The writing is surprisingly mediocre for a pixar / Disney tour. In fact, I had a hard time paying attention. The film really looks amazing, but the story becomes so weird and long that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could take it out. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is not 'It's an interesting concept, it's so strange (bad scenario?), especially when we' meet the family 'for the first time . I know we're supposed to feel like the family is crazy, but good lord, they could have shortened the sequence by 15 good minutes (apparently, I have not really timed). At this point, I was scratching my head looking for an exit.
