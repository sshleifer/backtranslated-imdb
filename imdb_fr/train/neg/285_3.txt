It's not really gymnastics; Swap occasional training mounts and it could be archery, microbiology or an exhausting tournament as well. Instead, like all the other Rocky / Flashdance derivatives that flooded the 80s market, it's about overcoming adversity by staying true to reality, making all social / personal realities useless - with a love interest of course. Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, in short; So, as a movie, everything is in the details. Some actors are odd enough to animate things - especially the love interest, presented by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; The obnoxious alkie father of heroin Olivia D'Abo and her half-sister with thick hair are more interesting than the unhealthy mother or her sluts / teammates completely inert, one of which seems to be porcelain. It's my instinct to be dismayed by comic blacks, but at least they are in the movie. But D'Abo does not really convince with his clumsy shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative narrative, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself really matters; These are just bodies that go by and not only the outcome of this great tournament is predictable, it is simply performed by a double.
