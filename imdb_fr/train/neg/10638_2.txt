The proof that everything that touches Tarantino does not turn into gold. It's quite plastic. It's easy to see that without Quentin's involvement, it would probably have been years on the shelves, that is, it would have already been produced. Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role. William Baldwin is better as a Serial Killer who keeps Jones at work! On the whole rather poor.
