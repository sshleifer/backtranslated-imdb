This film could have been an interesting character study and could have given a glimpse of its subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it does not contain any of this. This gives no idea or solution to the problem. It's just the portrayal of "old men" and the problems that it creates for his daily life and his family. Why would you want to watch this? All of this is totally useless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It does not help either that the main character is a wrinkled man over 50 years old. You will have trouble identifying and sympathizing with him. He just seems to be an old dirty playboy, who constantly hunts the woman and the sex. He has all kinds of sex about 3 times a day with different women and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It does not have a bad visual style either, even if everything seems a bit forced. But nevertheless, all this is more beautiful than most other direct productions. Who knows, if the filmmakers had better work material, the film would have deserved better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes ridiculous. There are really useless intrigues that are often more laughable than they were obviously. For example, I'm talking about Ordell's plot. The situation gets worse once the film begins to end. In addition, the narrative of the story between the events and the sessions of the main character with his psychiatrist is a bit simple and cheap. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to bad movies, it's just not one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other random movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It always seems strange and quite amazing that they have managed to play Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. a mere small insignificant production like this. I guess they were really looking for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
