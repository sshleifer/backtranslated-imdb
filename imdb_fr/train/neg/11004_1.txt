It really impresses me that this is done. The director / scriptwriter / actor must be truly charismatic. I can not think of any other way to pass the script step. What I want you to consider is this ... watching the movies, I felt sorry for the actors. I felt like I was in a comedy club where the guy is dying and sitting down there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him, despite the risk of 'try. I really like to know what is the budget, I guess it should be low because the quality of the film is really poor. I want to write "the jokes did not catch me". but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you must be the man who wrote them. or a delay. So imagine that as a script ... and this guy has this green on. That's impressive, is not it?
