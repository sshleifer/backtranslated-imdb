A different look on horror. The differences in style between American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American point of view, this movie was just not so good. The protagonist Marie played by Anastasia Hille was not a nice character and I had trouble identifying with her. She was uncomfortable most of the time and confused for much of the short time she had left. In addition, we spent too much time driving it to the main location of the film. Then, it was a long time before a real suspense was created. Once that happened, it seemed that the volume was used as the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they did not use sex to compensate for a thin plot. Overall, I would recommend it for rental, but not for theater lovers.
