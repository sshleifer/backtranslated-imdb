I have already said in other reviews, without history, you can give the public all the smoke and mirrors you want, but no one will care. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a big eye for the 30s art deco (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and others could well be the wave of the future in filmmaking. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film that he forgot to film many scenes, which would have helped enormously this film surprisingly cleared up. (Spoiler) To shout loudly, they forgot to have a bad guy in this thing! OK, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years at the time of filming. Conran misses the point of having a bad guy. Regarding the action, see, Captain Sky (Law) shot A robot, two or three winged aircraft (before Dex (Ribisi) told him to stop shooting them !!!), and some robots. but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight for him. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky or anything is totally spoiled in this movie (the reviewer commenting on his and Law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I got a little sick of seeing repeated shots from above from her camera, showing that she has only two left shots that she then lost in the film, one funny, the other funny enough, even though I saw her coming 70 years old. No one, except Law and Paltrow, has time on the screen, and this is the real flaw of the film. Spectators do not identify with robots, they need a hero, and a visible and despicable villain to hate. Without that, plus a good engaging story, not everyone in the world will help.
