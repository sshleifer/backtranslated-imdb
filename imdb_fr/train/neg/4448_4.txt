What a powerful beginning for a film when Julia Roberts' character is hit in the face by her violent and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to live a powerful film at the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary indicates, I was misdirected. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the role of a woman you really felt and felt his pain and need to survive. After the first act, Sleeping with the Enemy let herself drift, but Roberts simulated her death to escape her husband and went to live in Iowa. Her husband initially believes she is dead but begins to suspect that she may still be alive and chase after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia setting up a house in this small town in Iowa that changes her identity. It is not said how she got this money, but at this stage of the movie I did not care at all. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice Wimpy) and falls in love with him and her husband finally catches her, but not until he has rearranged his soup boxes and put his kitchens in order. I guess it's to give the public a cheap thrill. But I did not care if she was an abused woman, because the movie, as I said, was misleading. If that had stayed the course, I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course, the husband is killed and everything is fine for little old Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world was close to that ... See The Burning Bed and you understand what a movie is supposed to look like in domestic violence.
