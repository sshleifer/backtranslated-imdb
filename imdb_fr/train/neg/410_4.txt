Unfortunately, one of the best efforts to date in the field of special effects has been rendered totally useless by being placed alongside a tedious, silly and equally useless plot and an inadequate and clich√©d scenario. Hollow Man is a rather useless movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually everything that has been seen here has been done until death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the elevator shaft!) - with the the only truly intriguing element of the film being the awesome special effects. However, it is always the same special effect that is done over and over again and that, at the end of the film, is dead too. I was hoping before looking at Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, is the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not the case. Quickly, the movie turns into an all-too-familiar bloodbath and a mass of ineffective histrionics - the pile of shots accumulates so fast that it's almost impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, Kevin Bacon does a rather useless job and his actors do not do the maximum. The good points could be a passable score from Jerry Goldsmith (but no competition for his best efforts), a pretty interesting use of thermal imagery and special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push the merit of Hollow Man a notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
