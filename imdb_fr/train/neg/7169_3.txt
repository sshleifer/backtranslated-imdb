It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the little slave Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this film entertaining. The fact that Alice smokes, drinks and is strangely presented when she is called is strange and interesting. I have to congratulate Jared for imitating Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the film.
