Not since Caligula, I considered turning off the film midway ... but then with it, there were only 15 minutes when I thought. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you do not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or bloody, scary, scary or sexual. It's not one of those things, yet he so desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, mundane, banal, ordinary, predictable, and exceptionally poorly executed (videotaped, special effects in high school, no sense of visual narration, even elemental, dull dialogue ... but not that it's worth being heard). /> <br /> This film is irrefutable proof that even direct video distributors must draw a line somewhere.
