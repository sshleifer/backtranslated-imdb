First, if you watch Revolt of the Zombies as a very early Night of the Living Dead movie (1968), forget it. These are "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where this term simply refers to a person who does not have control over his will, but who instead must follow the will of another person. The "zombies" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors of submission to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. It's pretty hard to call it a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the First World War. A "French Cambodian" contingent has heard strange stories about zombification - supposedly Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are legends of Zombie armies easily overcoming enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest supposed to know the secret of zombification, but he does not want to speak. Louque and an international military contingent travel to Angkor Wat for an archaeological expedition to uncover the secret of zombification and destroy information before the zombies have a chance to "destroy the white race". <br /> <br /> The strange thing about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems that author / director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the screenplay. The film begins as if it explored the zombie / military metaphor, and perhaps even had elements of adventure, but after about 15 minutes, it changes the subject and becomes more of a love triangle story. <br /> <br /> Halperin really sticks with a subtext about will and power (and a Nietzschean "will to power"). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very hectic. It is still an older film for which I would not be surprised if there are missing images, especially since some scenes fade or even disappear while a character discusses. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the artificial love affair, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but few zombie things make a lot of sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but that does not mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of zombie material are vague and confusing - Halperin even resorts to the use of superimposed images of Bela Lugosi's wide-eyed eyes from his 1932 film, White Zombie, but never explains what he has to do . There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. The promising and interesting characters of the first reels disappear for long periods. A bad potential is eliminated without ceremony before being able to do a lot. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of old grumpy B films, it may be interesting to watch Revolt of the Zombies at least once. Playing is not so bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in any gaps. But this is the second time I see the film, the first one dating back to about five years ago, and I could barely remember, so it's not really memorable.
