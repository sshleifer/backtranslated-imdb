Ok, now, I know that there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: this moment when all the people born again in Christ will be removed to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in the plagues and fire and sorrow of psoriasis as the Antichrist fights against Jesus (in an unusually warlike fashion). And I know that books were best sellers. . Believers, anyway. And I do not want to disrespect all of this. <br /> <br /> But I must say that they put this film in a bag and beat it with the stick to suck. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need to be reproduced. If you watched this movie, chances are you read the book. I may be one of the only people on the planet to have watched this just for the pure experience of what has been overwhelming, and I have not been disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the little Growing Pains, grown up, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career went to the dogs, but now, you can be happy to be able to spread the word of God so badly to the cinema, that they never even manage to go out to the cinema. Well, that's not quite true: I guess it's the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST, with a voucher for a free movie preview when it was released briefly in theaters! I always have the good! You suppose how many people came? I do not know about you, but he never arrived in my city. Of course, I live in New York, where we, the Liberals without God, sit down to tear pages of the Bible and use them to roll joints. So this is it. In fact, I bet that out of three million people on Manhattan Island, none would be kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Check out the additional documents on the DVD, where you'll learn the frightening behind-the-scenes secrets of these movies. . .the CAST and CREW must all be of the same religious mindset. They do not say that, but listen carefully to what the filmmakers say. It's as if a group of Pod People had come together to make a Pod movie. How is creepazoid? Honestly, these things only preach to the converted, do not they? Can you imagine someone who does not subscribe to the apocalypse by looking at it, slapping his forehead and saying, "SAINT HOOVER DAM! I better save myself PRONTO! Anyway, I'm addicted. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially the one with Gary Busey, who I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least, Busey has an excuse to play that role. he cracked his head on a sidewalk when he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What about all the plans of poor, whining, innocent dogs, their leashes dragging needlessly on the ground, because their owners have been called to paradise? What's up with that? Are we supposed to have trouble for dogs, and if we do, what should we do with God? Do not people see that there is no place in heaven for the best friend of man? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is one more reason for me to be agnostic. Good night and good luck.
