First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was very happy to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined this excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having curls and frayed glasses and considered very rude. In the film, she has smooth hair and no glasses and is of the "sporty" type with a deep voice. That's not how Madeleine L'Engle imagined Meg. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and described how she felt when she was young. This is just a major example of the difference between the book and the movie. So I would say that if you want to watch it for entertainment, look at it, but if you're a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest you skip this movie.
