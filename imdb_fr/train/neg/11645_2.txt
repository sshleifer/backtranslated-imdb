This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story', theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most phonetic, uninspired and tedious biographical documentaries I have ever seen. If the film I saw in a movie theater was initially broadcast on television, I would ask its producers and distributors not to fool a paying audience with the false promise of a documentary film worthy of the cinema . Even as a television documentary, sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and pompous pseudo-literary narration sounded more likely as part of an Infopublic direct mail. The only redeeming aspects of this "Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uh, it was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana", are the original concert, video footage, and television footage - Freddy Mercury and Queen unshakeable. Interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses, with ideas such as "He was a free spirit" (really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a man of society ...) downplayed these testimonials by Freddy, Brian May or Montserrat Caballe and loving light in the complex life and character of Mercury. And ... what's going on with the Harry Potter boarding segments? How does the interview with the overwhelming first girl ("... who now works in a travel agency") and the members of Freddy's first school group contributed to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of her personal life, sexuality, artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remains unexplored. These filmmakers do not pose a single provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research on their subject. To remember this biography of History Channel, your grandparents can fall asleep on a Sunday night.
