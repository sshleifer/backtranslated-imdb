I was expecting a lot of this film (the title, translated, is "How we get rid of others"). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has suffered the consequences of the constant verbal and legislative persecution of the right-wing government against so-called independents and leftists in general, and decided to kill everything who can not prove that they contribute to the establishment (this institution being called "the common good", but actually meaning the interests of capitalist ideology in power). <br /> <br /> Very good idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this film completely misses its chance. Satire only comes out in a few scenes and absurd performances, but this satire is not supported; it is neither lively nor spiritual. And for a so-called comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. Comedy, I suppose, is supposed to be in the absurdity of situations, but situations are generally uncomfortable and too serious, rather than evoking laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full of serious misclassification. The action should have been focused on the political aspects and the harm in doing such a thing, but on the contrary, we spend a lot of time on a young woman who wrote the new laws for fun and who tries to save all the world. , organizing a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this is next to the point! A film like this one should not claim to be so serious! It's a satire! A political declaration. But it does not even begin to really tackle the problem it is supposed to be facing. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? Is loose. This is not art. It's not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, a very serious actor and now one of the most experienced actors in Denmark, was very good. It bore largely the little entertainment value that the film had. Everyone: nothing special (well, except perhaps Lene Poulsen, who provided a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, in most Danish films, the language does not seem natural. Neither formulation nor delivery. Why is it so hard to ring it properly? Why must it be so elevated and artificial? I hope that when people watch these films in fifty years, they will not think that's the way people have spoken in Danish society in general. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
