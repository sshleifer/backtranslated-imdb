I just watched this movie last night and I had to warn anyone who is considering seeing this movie. In a word - no. I seriously think it's something a script student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is all other words were curses. I do not have a problem with profuse curses, like in "Good Will Hunting", provided that it helps to delve deeper into the characters. In this case, it was simply hollow jokes with the attempt to pull an occasional * sigh * or a laugh from the audience. The three main characters each have their own stereotype, the Wall Street joker, the coffee house jerk and the "I'm not-gay-just-in-touch-with-my-female-side" slightly-less- of-a-jerk. You do not really care! They are all superficial and irrecoverable losers that you WANT to lose. For those who dare, this film has some fun moments, from the very beginning to the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny, in a sickly state "Uh, yeah". Really though, I would only recommend this film to my worst enemy.
