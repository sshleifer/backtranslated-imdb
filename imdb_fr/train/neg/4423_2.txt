Another of the many forgotten movies, created by Poverty Row in the 1930s, resurrected by the magic of DVD. <br /> <br /> The star player Universal Lionel Atwill (often actor in many Frankenstein films) in the form of pair of twins involved in a murder racket. One of them kills the victims (the stock brokers involved in a scam) and asks the witnesses the exact time, while the other is deaf and is declared "innocent" because he could not have spoken to no witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it falls apart, if it were a congenital deafness, would not they both be deaf? Oh good. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a very good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else here can really act.
