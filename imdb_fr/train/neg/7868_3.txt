I saw a lot of Guy Maddin's films and I liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is far too frenetic and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of slamming heads to look at an object, only interferes with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I disliked in this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's previous works - although his films still had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the film a dominant feeling of humanity. This one was more like hardness for the sake of hardness. <br /> <br /> As I am obliged to add other lines of text before IMB accepts my comment, I will mention that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" succeeds to singer his facial expressions quite well .
