In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death, accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before dying, they curse the next generations of their executioners. Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) attend a sitting session where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac . They decide to go to Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the countryside, looking for a monastery with hidden treasure. They find the head of Alaric and the demon owns them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the premises with bloody sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he had hidden the amulet of Thor's Hammer in a well. with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniacs Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I bought a box of the horror genre containing five Paul Naschy DVDs for US $ 9.98; despite the lack of references, I decided to try my luck. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a movie about the B (or C) basket that immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed through a scenario, a realization, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and horrible editions and with many naked women. The result is just hilarious and I can assure you that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
