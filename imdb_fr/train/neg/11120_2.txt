You know that a movie is bad when it comes to being able to see a brief moment of "Jeopardy!" <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that he had huge potential. For many years, I lived in a region that looks like the one described in this film. racial tensions were high and basketball was important to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre action and the mediocre scenario in White Men Can not Job left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events in the film is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money playing basketball. He then returns home and walks with his girlfriend. and the process is repeated. Most stories reach a climax, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence of this rehearsal (this case being "Billy wins or loses money playing basketball"). <br /> For a plot to develop, a dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting for the film to be too. Apparently White Men writers Can not Jump have forgotten this rule, the plot can be summarized as: "Billy must pay the bills." I enjoyed the change of pace compared to other sports movies, but - I'm sorry - it was just awful. I could not care if Billy had the money to pay the rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a hit movie. Apparently, some inflexible sports fans will dismiss the terrible writings of some scenes with a basketball. Others, I am sure, have been attracted by the big names who play the leading role. This puzzles me: if the cast was completely replaced by previously unknown actors and the topic of basketball was replaced by that of lacrosse, would anyone have bothered to watch this film? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this film two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the "Jeopardy!" scene, which prevented me from sleeping for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
