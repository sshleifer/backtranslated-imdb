Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells in search of sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of sharks of the territory with cute little sneers on their hungry face. Wilde and his merry men have to find a way to get off the menu so they can start searching an old Spanish galleon filled with gold bullion. <br /> <br /> After the crew is engaged in a little eternity, discussing and listening to Wilde's boring health tips, 5 crazy convicts get on board and complicate things. Now it's a battle of wits to know who will have the treasure and who will see what looks inside the stomach of a shark. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is fit and wearing exactly the same clothes he wore 'The Naked Prey' 10 years ago and he stayed in great condition. <br /> <br /> Made with a budget of 75 cents.
