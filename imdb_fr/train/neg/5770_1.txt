If I had to create a film thermometer, this film would have an absolute zero. On ten stars, I would evaluate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Parcel: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's as if The high school students met one afternoon with a camera, invented a screenplay and shot a movie. It lacks so much artistic value that I would rather watch the children stroll through a high school than watch this movie. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, something must be said about the abyssal depths. The "shooting" on the stairs is one of the funniest scenes ever seen on a train accident. First, the fighters simply wave plastic cannons against each other, waving their arms to simulate recoil. The couple "hide" the balls that do not exist from each other. No bit, no sparks, no whites, just shaking pump guns. If you want to see two adult men playing "the actor", try it one day ... after cleaning the fridge, combing the carpet, polishing all the doorknobs, raking the gravel, straightening the books on the floor. shelf, etc. .
