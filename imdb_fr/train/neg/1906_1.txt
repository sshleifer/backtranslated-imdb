They played at the July 4th marathon in Twilight Zone and it's by far the worst episode of Twilight Zone I've ever seen. It is completely out of sync with the rest of the series. Even though Twilight Zone is a fairly uneven series and many episodes end up being terribly predictable, it was completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "The Midnight Sun" and you realize there is no comparison possible. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material and, frankly, it amazes me that someone of his historical stature comedy drops to the level of this episode. Even if he seems to be making an effort, he MUST need the money ... there is no other explanation.
