If there has ever been a worse comedy than "Gray Matters", I'm not aware of it. The comedy "fun" of the Jewish comedy of New York is that the brothers and sisters Sam and Gray are confused with a couple and decide to arrange it with a girlfriend, to discover that Gray is also attracted by their target, Charlie . The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently just a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing "drunkenness" of Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that could have embarrassed the forests for Tom Cavanagh's wood. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a total inability to do comedy and will want it to be excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the intimate friend lumpen carelessly. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously underemployed and has no way of working. All the disaster is cemented by Graham's strange performance, which culminates with the penultimate scene in which she wears a comedy hat and overcoat despite the scene taking place in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this movie has never been released, it has no redemptive functionality and should be avoided at all costs.
