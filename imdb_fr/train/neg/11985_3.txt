Ever wanted to eat worms? Here is a "documentary" to show you how! Yeah ... The kid eats live worms! And that's about the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film has been pretty well summarized by previous critics as rather boring. I totally agree here. The movie is not going anywhere ... unless you like to eat worms! It's a movie, it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now, on the technical side: they should have given a haircut to this child. Who is he looking like ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to become the hairy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; the kid was way too big to look hungry! He should have prevented him from eating junk food for a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film almost fell asleep. And my children could only endure about 15 minutes before leaving the stage for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the landscape was very impressive. And if there had been a story worthy of the name, it might have been a success. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for the children to look at it: the bear scenes and the "oddball" eyeball were too weak to scare most children, and the short 'skinny-dipping' scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave this one a very generous 3.
