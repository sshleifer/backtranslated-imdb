I had high hopes for this film, even though he had a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant and sat for the whole movie. I felt very bad at the end. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema, I loved Woody Allen's movie "All you wanted to know about sex" .. And Michael Hanneke's "Funny Games" - I found the filmmakers' obsession with this ten-year-old girl who wanted to drink milk for women was completely disgusting. And when the film culminated in an "orgy" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk and that of the woman he covets since the beginning of the film, I almost vomited with disgust of total perversion and sentimental sentimental that it <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I appreciate the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this film should have pleased me immensely. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema.
