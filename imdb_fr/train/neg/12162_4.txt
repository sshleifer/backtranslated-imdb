It's not a horror, as was the first part: it's light and humorous entertainment. As in so many sequels, the action begins immediately without explanation. But there are breasts, so I do not complain. And real tits it is. As I understand it, these are pretty rare nowadays among American teenagers of A. What makes me think that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> That can not be thought without the first movie, so I compare that to that. Once again, there are clothes too small (mainly pants) and funny hair, it is not difficult to say in which decade this film is made. Once again, there are really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological". Especially the camp staff. It's like a summer mental rehabilitation camp. People are older: most actors must be at least 25 years old, but I think they are supposed to be 16 years old or something. Some "methods" used by the Evke Dyke are quite unpleasant. In fact, this movie does not have much in common with the first part and it's worse than in all respects.
