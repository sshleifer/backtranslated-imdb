It's more like a mystery movie with some free horror elements; mediocre overall. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman's nightmare in which her sexual partner gets out of bed, goes to her crying child's room and kills him. She wakes up. Then, this man is dying in a hospital, spitting blood. His old daughter arrives and he manages to contact her through his dreams (I think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body decomposed entirely in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have understood this well before it is revealed. I'm not sure that the way he was killed would have really worked. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the elements of horror infiltrate: a bloody autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs is transformed in eyes that are then cut off, and several shots of the man in decomposition at once in nightmares and in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see a dedication at the end of Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
