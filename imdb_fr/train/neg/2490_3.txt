What a sad sight that these pillars of television make, run to the clock during their career, stumbling on a small rusty boat from a boat-boat might be more appropriate. All production seems cheap and shabby, and a "big name" star who is barely able to spit the few lines he has credibly provided does not help. <br /> <br /> At no time, the support flows rise above the material they clearly look at the clock here. Jump behind the scenes, retrieve the pay check, go home and try to forget everything. <br /> <br /> This is not particularly badly written or filmed; there are no real clangers, it is quite innocuous and draws in a very limited number of narrow sets with a small group of extras. The rhythm is a little weird; a timid and embarrassing romantic sub-plot begins only after the beginning of the main action, which renders it irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage marks a few points for being skillfully marked and for being a fun game to "spot kiwi bites"; most actors are Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess graduates. The saddest part of this production is that this film is probably their big break.
