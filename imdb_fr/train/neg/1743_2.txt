Unlike its title, this film offers no spice and the public is therefore subject to a dish without taste. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, recalling the Pakistani pieces available on video, including even mannerisms. Everyone screams, shouts and does strange things for no reason. The premise seems interesting, because it comes straight from the Boeing Boeing of Hollywood. "John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is a complete maladjusted.If we consider the moral factor, the bizarre events seem commonplace. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced believers, are struggling to make the film look natural, but to no avail, at least the characters of three young girls should be contrasted to bring interesting elements, but unfortunately here also, all these brainless people appear, buxomed (3B) bimbettes who speak, behave and even howl in a pretty similar way. The main hole in the plot is what prompted the protagonist to keep the three girls in his same home by pretending that they will never know each other, to do sex, what else, the same thing could be done in hundreds of other ways. mabaazi without reason is not something that the public readily digests. But surely, a great show of flesh and enticing promises always give uch film a good initial. Now, for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such an audience going to the cinema is surely gone in corruption and insanity as it connects to a kind of sadistic humor, strange and exasperating, where they are not the characters they make fun of themselves and theirs. frustrations that seem insane to us, to be able to laugh, we have to endure such things?
