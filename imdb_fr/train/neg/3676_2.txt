Susan Swift is an attractive girl, a flower child transplanted in the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she does not quite have the vocal range required for a demanding drama and she tends to moan; However, she is rather sweet and has bright eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as it was called when it was briefly released in theaters), Swift could be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The film is very low budget and borrows from so many other pictures that I left about 15 minutes from the end. It starts strong and has some attraction for the camp. Obviously, there are more serious films dealing with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen for this one; However, as unwanted movies go, it's not too bad. The Boston places are an undeniable advantage, and the secondary distribution is fun. * 1/2 of ****
