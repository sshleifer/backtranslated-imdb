With MASSIVE advertising, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. are being fooled, and that's how my son asked us to see him. Between the DVD and the theaters, I have seen almost everything, from the exceptional (Incredibles, Shrek) to the very bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was easily the worst movie I have ever seen, kids or no kids. It was a "when is that stupid thing going to end?" kind of experience? OK, it's for toddlers (or better, it's insulting to more than 3 years old), but I've never seen anything so predictable, repetitive, and slow. Then, once you're fed up but you're relieved that the movie is over, there's this strange thing in the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there's none - it's is serious, although it is difficult to say what they are trying to accomplish. 3D effects ... Yeah, if you've never seen a Viewmaster, it's a big deal, if not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it looks like it's the same thing). Even my son was bored at the end. My wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in all respects.
