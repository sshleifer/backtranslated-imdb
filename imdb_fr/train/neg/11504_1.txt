Alias: Mondays in the sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just watched. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, scolding about everything and everyone on their way. It's supposed to be a drama, but it's a total waste of film, without any redemptive quality. <br /> <br /> I read reviews extolling the performances presented here as "wonderful", "beautiful," and "heroic." I'm afraid I do not agree unless these men are supposed to present themselves as the most stupid and ignorant proto-humans who have ever walked. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was not a movie. He wanders everywhere and loses everyone but the public. I watched it three times and I can not see what anyone sees in this trash. There is nothing deep here, either. It's shit. <br /> <br /> He notes a ZERO / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the demon :.
