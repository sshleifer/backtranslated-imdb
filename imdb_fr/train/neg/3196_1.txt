The only words you need are more fearful than Joe Don Baker if you're thinking of watching a movie, it's Greydon Clark, and if they're both here, run for life. However, it is a very funny movie because they take themselves really seriously! It starts badly and it goes down again from there, repeated scenes, the Good The Bad and The Ugly like gunfire will make you roll on the ground with bursts of laughter. as only he can. He sets his own rules, does things his way, while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms like cowboys. Want to see a bad movie but funny? Go ahead, it's up to you!
