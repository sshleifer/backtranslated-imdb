I loved the original story, I was very much expecting the movie (especially since Barker was delirious in the interviews), I finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The staging is ubiquitous, the acting was atrocious, the visual and choreographic visual elements were simply flat, empty and totally useless (with the generic techniques of video clips like the monster fast-slow-slow? Useless in this film and has softened the atmosphere in a dumb MTV videotape (Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo) While some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, others are ridiculous (the first killing of the Japanese was hilarious and the death of Ted Raimi was just ridiculous.) He rushed into all places without tension or suspense, moving away completely from the original story and then back to the final, which at that moment only has to feel stuck to spoil it even more, no explanation was given, I mean, I only knew what was happening when I read the story, but for people who did not, it was even more confusing, because sometimes I did not even know where it was going and what he was trying to do - it was a crazy tangent all the time. <br /> <br /> My God, I really wanted to love this movie because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and I loved the story because it has a huge potential. For a fantastic movie, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's films, but this film smelled of amateurishness and foolishness from start to finish. I did not care about anyone or anything, everything was rushed and severely cut off. the real source, turning it into something else. Admittedly, it was bloody and Vinnie Jones was playing a superb tough guy, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. Empty
