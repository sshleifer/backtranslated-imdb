Shazbot, is it embarrassing? In fact, here is a list of 100 that is embarrassing: 1.) A missed return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels plays essentially the same role as in the live remake of 101 Dalmatians, who was not too juicy to start. He certainly has a fun way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is at Disney what Jet Li was to Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian of the TV series, played a role (read "cameo") in this film and died two years later of lupus. Coincidence? 6.) Terrible special effects. Seriously - horrible. 7.-100.), That damn suit that speaks, fart, pissed off by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Whew! ... good. You are a joker. Let us end this review with a minute of silence on the atrocious death of this franchise. If you wish, you can quickly say that Disney does not forget this parody and do something ridiculous like a cinematic adaptation of "Mindy" with Tim Allen ................ ............................. ............
