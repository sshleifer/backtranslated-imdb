Here is a movie with a good distribution and a nice filming job but he does not have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been a bit tired at this stage of the game; How much better was his THE PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be slow, even during the scenes without slowing down. This film had to be accelerated, if necessary. This horse moss seemed horribly false and the tire marks evident in those moments of desert travel - just lazy. botched work. Pity. The actors worked well, but I certainly saw them all better. Ben Johnson is always a joy, though. I saw this movie for the first time almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and remained so on second viewing 30 years later.
