"The Brain Machine" will at least put your own brain in the overdrive trying to understand what it's all about. Four subjects of various origins and levels of intelligence were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment. Given that the only common denominator between them is the fact that they do not have a known family, this is good news - none of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is watched by a mysterious creep known only as a general, but it seems to follow the instructions of a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good call from the senator. There is also a shadow guard on which the camera is constantly zooming in, which later states that it does not take its instructions from the General or "The Project". Too bad it is not more effective, it has been mastered easily enough before everything happens as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the film is a treasure trove of technology from the 1970s featuring repeated blows of dial phones, room-sized computers and a fax machine that does not want not stop. Maybe it was the basis of the alternative title of the movie - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. For my part, I would like to consider a title suggested by Dr. Krisner's murdered experiment, entitled "Group Stress Project". This applies to actors and viewers of the film. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye just above the general's head by the pool when he asks his officer for a gun, a micro-tower is visible over his head for several seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to watch this movie if you are an unconditional fan of Gerald McRaney, could he have been so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat unusual role as a cryptic reverend, but do not call him Father. For something more in the driveway, try getting your hands on "The Killer Shrews" from 1959. This one at least does not pretend to be so serious.
