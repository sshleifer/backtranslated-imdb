Already, his first statement, namely that desires are always artificial, is totally misleading. <br /> <br /> When a Jehovah's Witness Rejects his Documentary on Cinema ?? or anything else - it's time for anyone to get theirs. Although much, much smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult), Zizek's mouth spits as much as rubbish, but of a completely different kind. He combines the worst of his two professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. It is well known that the two domains offer the expert an easy opportunity to osolate a leeway to create impossible-to-prove theories, to unleash without beginning or end, and to connect concepts in an almost random way, creating thus a bad use of the English language by creating a semantic environment. a clutter that only a mother can love. Example: There are three main Marx brothers, hence the "big" idea of ​​associating them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the superego. I'm a little surprised that he did not play a video of "Snowhite" and made an analogy between the seven dwarves and the seven Gahannah levels (Muslim hell). This sounds like the principle of Schumacher's "The Number 23": play with fairly long numbers and you can suggest any cockamamy theory you want, even linking the ancient Greeks to the death of Princess Di. <br /> <br /> However, TPGTC has an element of entertainment: watching a delirious sweat like a pig while pronouncing delusional songs masked by an intellectual analysis can be very entertaining. Why look at "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other crazy house drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train wreck. Admittedly, he's almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I have always been mystified by people who are desperately trying to make filmmaking an exalted intellectual social science. To give silly movies as "Birds" this thought, and therefore this credit, probably made his big creator laugh in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of films have no intellectual value and the few who possess a certain intelligence do not need a retractable philosopher to draw a map to understand them. unless you're a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs have to be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the shower scene "Psycho", I thought that he was going to talk about galactic black holes; how they drain the life of the stars just as the hole in the tub sucks Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing there instead of going out (as in menstruation), which represents a kind of "intelligent irony (Zizekian)". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put so much attention into every scene (and scenario), his films would not have been an illogical and exaggerated crap that they are often. The purpose of these analogies with the holes in the bathtub was to show how easy it is to improvise about "hidden and deep meanings". And when you add the whimsical terminology of Zizek from philosophy and psychology, by superimposing these terms to analogies such as wedding cake decorations, you get an entanglement that can instantly impress the uneducated - that's to say easily impressionable and void. Zizek here makes a number of fun things (involuntarily). One of the most absurd ideas is that he combines the cleaning of the bloody bathroom by Anthony Perkins with "the satisfaction of work, of a job well done". Do not laugh ... neither Hitchcock nor the author of "Psycho" could ever have even vaguely imagined that Perkins might enjoy a job well done - cleaning a blood stained toilet - during the design / accomplishment of this task. scene. Talk about putting words in his (dead) mouth, but in the context of a misinterpretation of what the director had to say. <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's first thoughts on Tarkovsky's amazing "Solaris". ruin a rare good impression by incorporating "anti-feminism" and other nonsense in his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog to his plastic bone. "I just want to play with all day!" Logic has its rules and is not supposed to be violated - at least not publicly - by its kind. He seems to regard logic, proof, common sense and reason as enemies or mere disposable toys. concepts either to avoid, to twist to achieve the ultimate goal, or simply to be annihilated. Zizek is a hippie on LSD, and all her favorite movies are her own "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses too much on two of the most overrated directors - and those whose films are often Lack of intelligence, like Hitchcock and Lynch, further diminishes his already weak credibility . I was surprised that De Palma was not more prominent; it's another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a day on the field with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are as many interpretations of this movie as there are people who have watched it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer easily accepts von Trier's ridiculous and "revolutionary" montage in "Dogville" was made me sneer. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek is not only inventing things as he goes along, he is also doing a lot of "obvious purging". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he wraps his "observations" very banal in articulated language covers (so full of spittle) and sometimes complex. After all, sociology works in exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we are hearing something new, which is what we all already know, but that we tell in an eloquent way - which deceives the listener most attentive. <br /> <br /> I almost expected men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and put them in loonies ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a children's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
