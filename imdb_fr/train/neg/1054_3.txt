The rural family drama - perhaps with a nod to "ordinary people" - is about a young boy who folds on himself after mortally wounds his older brother in a ball accident. In spite of the heaviness of the subject (treated without mercy by the director Christopher Cain), this sad story deserves to be explored. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation make the film an insulting experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the film is almost a small-scale meeting of "The Natural". Too bad this project did not bring the necessary talent behind the camera to create a striking and memorable image. * 1/2 of ****
