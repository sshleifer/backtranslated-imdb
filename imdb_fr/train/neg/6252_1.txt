Ronald Reagan and a group of American soldiers in a North Korean prisoner of war camp. They are tortured ... We learn that the North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that the beard of Americans grows very slowly during the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to delete it, but I finally burst. laugh about this movie. This is the scene where Mr. Reagan has just told the Communists that he wants to be with them. Then he asks for a bottle of cognac. Then, acting sober, he asks a drunk companion, Dewey Martin, to have sulfur to heal Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean communist guard is as dumb as it comes. So, the intoxicated person distracts the guard while Reagan approaches to take something from a drawer next to a pile of empty boxes. I'm sure it was supposed to contain boxes. but, of course, Reagan makes them shake enough to reveal that they are empty. You must laugh! I think that "Prisoner of War" will primarily interest the family and friends of those who have worked there - otherwise, it is wasteful. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest and Dewey Martin
