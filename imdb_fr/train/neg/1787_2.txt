I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark and edgy black film set for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start with the acting game. None of this is really good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But it does not say much. He's good at first, and then you realize he's what he is, a bodybuilder who happens to be a tolerable actor. But the problem is that Batman has no place in the open, he looks like a monster running in a bat costume. Instead of a horribly scarred man trying to catch up with the mistakes of the past. Daylight also reveals an irritating dorky grimace on Bartram's face that never leaves an imperceptible trace in Batman: Dead End, probably because of the darkness of the film that is so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that snorting and stubbornly shaking his head is acting, it's not, it's just the opposite. This is called posing, what real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collora chose bodybuilders as leaders. It makes a lot more sense to give the role to an actor who can handle it, rather than a bodybuilder who can handle it a bit, but HEY LUI is so much like comics! Of course, they might have done better if Collora's dialouge did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, the trailer, there will not be a feature film) is more centered on Superman then Batman. But everything on Superman's side is nerdy, disgusting and amateurish. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He stands there, smiles, says his lines. It is more or less that. Although I'm not surprised because he is just a bodybuilder, they hired and eventually received some drama lessons. Once again, I say to Collora, throw ACTORS. No bodybuilders. The actors will be so much more convincing than we will forgive the fact that they do not look exactly like comics. <br /> <br /> The suit is what you would expect Superman to wear. As for the Batman costume. Well, I guess it looks good in the dark. I say that because, on some levels, the costume looks like something you would buy in a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But that's not a good thing. These shots seem particularly amateurish. This and a lot of all the "film" seems to have been shot in their backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a picture of Superman taking a car in his hand. And the last shot of Two-Face and Batman at the very end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only he could have stretched that shot in the whole caravan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why, if you try to show off your abilities as a director, would you make a trailer in the form of a short film? It does not prove anything when it comes to being a real director. My only advice for Collora is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel amateur. I can not understand where it went wrong.
