I would like to consider myself a rather open-minded type and it takes a lot (!) Not to like a movie, but this one is without a doubt one of the most devious and unpleasant movies I've ever seen have never seen! <Br /> <br /> I absolutely do not know what's wrong with the people who gave him such a good rating here (imdb is usually quite reliable in terms of notation) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people had to vote during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. 2. They received a large sum of money for votes 3. Under the threat of a revolver <br /> <br /> I can not believe I lost a good hour of my life for that pathetic excuse for a movie.
