WARNING! Do not even think about watching this movie in any form. It's not even worth downloading on the Internet. Every piece of porn has more substance than this piece of celluloid lost. The so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They could not tell a good joke to save their lives. It's an insult to every human being. If you're looking for a fun movie, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Mr. Unterwaldt (the "Jr." is a good indicator of his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy) a slow / painful death and NEVER redo a film. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time writing on this shit, that's why I'm going to stop now and watch a good movie instead.
