I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself a science fiction enthusiast. I've read countless sci-fi novels and enjoyed many science fiction movies and TV shows. I would not even consider this real science fiction. Every episode I attended was like a lame and diluted version of an episode of Star Trek, with the exception of anything that would make it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a group of people standing in army fatigues, talking about something boring, sometimes going through the Stargate and ending up on a planet who looks like Earth, with people who look and sound like humans! It seemed extremely small budget. The characters are all forgettable one-dimensional carvings, and the many humorous attempts fall flat. It reminds me when you see an advertisement with a famous athlete, trying to be funny, but he is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The film was terrible too. There are so many things you can do with a portal through space, yet every place where people in the military will get bored! This shows no imagination! I actually thought that the television series "Alien Nation" a few years back (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. This show actually had good stories and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated shit, it was great! <br /> <br /> In addition, unlike the superb new series "Battlestar Galactica", "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame film too tightly! They should at least have updated the special "flush toilet" effect whenever someone passes through the Stargate.
