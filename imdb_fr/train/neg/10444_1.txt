the only big thing about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the film. When I went to the theater, I was not expecting Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a fun movie, but instead, I had this horrible Roy Liotta film entitled "Turbulence". . The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And this is not even the favorite title of the film, it was not even a glimpse of "snake" or "plane" after 40 minutes of film! What false advertising! SOAP would not be its title, SOAP would be another unforgettable and inexpensive summer movie. And the note R? This film must be the most badly deserved of all time! The authors of the film add only a few words to make an R. All violence is maintained at the level of pg-13. You know what is really rated R? The superstar rated R Edge! Head to Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
