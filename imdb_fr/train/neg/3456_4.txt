Everyone in this film tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what director she will become one day, and so on. I think they are just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "The next Jane Campion", they call him; and, even apart from the fact that they are both overestimated, the two have so much in common. They both direct films. They are two women. They are both Australian. Yes, it's one of those movies in which a character is deemed brilliant, and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I'll say this for Carruthers: she's cute. And fascinating. Not really. Here are some thoughts on his lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of a director's talent lies in his relationships with people. Why is Carruthers so incredibly bad at making his team even notice it? To make it easier for everyone to get off the board and get killed, I guess. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the least convincing representations of a film set I've ever seen? After all, he must have been filmed on a real film set. How could they be wrong? If Rendall's decor was half as dramatic, he would have even finished his film. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - the fictional director - set about creating a brand new movie. Horror movie of the 1980s. Big luck. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - the current director, and more talented - has set himself the same task, realized that it could not be done, and arranged for (sigh) knowing parodying. Of course, it is not enough to parody to function as a parody. As soon as the actors and the film crew have set foot in the isolated mansion, the film spends most of its time doing the wrong thing the horror movies of the 1980s did ... well, less pain . <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and yet ... the film begins with parody but with an honest horror pastiche of the 80s, featuring (it's too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than all that follows. (This is a bad sign of wanting to watch the movie in the film rather than the movie.) Still, the film was also shot in the late 1990s. Maybe it's still possible to do the horror of the movies. 1980s You just have to drop the parodic stuff and understand it. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what would be the horror of the 1980s for teenagers if all the characters had an Australian accent, but now I know it. And strangely, I'm happy to know. A need that I never understood was fulfilled.
