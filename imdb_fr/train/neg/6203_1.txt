I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was horrible! All the rich, violent and clichy boy fantasies were exposed, you knew how it was going to end, especially with all the cliches of the chief's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was the questions / answers with the director / screenwriter and the screenwriter / producer that they tried to qualify as intellectuals, but you can say they are the type to to attack violence. I bet they go to brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to stop my boyfriend from getting out of there.
