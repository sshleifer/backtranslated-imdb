Wait, do not tell me ... they threw the film and kept the catch. You know, this movie could have been shot in an alley in New York. The "Bangster Gangster" I suppose. Gangster Rap, designer gangster feather duster clothes, including the scarf, that were moved from the neck to protect themselves from dust storms up to the head. I guess it was to protect the head from the heat that filtered through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie", it seems, provided the horses. The scene of a room where the girl was talking and the guy saying her words ... I thought it was him who was talking. You know, watching this movie only confirms that it's not about actors anymore, it's about looks and money. That could not have been too much of that about this movie. All in all, I think this film will be the worst film of all time. One more thing though, where was Ice T? Has he finally been able to go on Oprah?
