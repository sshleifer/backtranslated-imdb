This film is really bad, with a scenario full of "memorable" lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen either) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it. Two small themes (about 30 seconds or so) are constantly repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In total, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
