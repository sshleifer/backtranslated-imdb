This film was zero to say the least !!! The plethora of beautiful cars is disgraced from being featured in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas that must be completed in 45 minutes ... in Ferrari F430. I did it in 50 minutes in a 1993 Honda Accord of 4 cylinders with 140 hp. Seriously ... this film does not do justice to these cars. It is obvious that these authors are just that and that they probably respect the speed limit with their hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. I remember seeing news how Eddie Griffin crashed a $ 1.5 million Enzo Ferrari with a speed of 30-40 mph. >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms the biggest SELLOUT !!! He is shaming his own race. I wonder how many people he orally rained just to enter Hollywood. He participated in a film that portrays Asian Americans so negatively and FALSE. Asian women >> cheap whores money grubbing. Asian men >> losing compulsive gamblers and thugs who are being beaten all the time. What is all the fear of Asians? Why the need to always portray them with such negative connotations? I am SO MUCH disgusted with how Hollywood ALWAYS portrays Asians in such a negative and false pretense.
