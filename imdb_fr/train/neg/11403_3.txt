I love horror movies, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's .. but how can you think it's a really good horror movie? let's compare it to movie titles from the same haunted house. obsession, changeling, brilliance. or for a horror movie based on similar technology that was FAAAR best (although still far from awesome) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be honest ... let's compare that to horror movies designed for television! Do not go to sleep .. waaay more scary and better done. the fate of Salem, the night stalker, the night gallery, not even going to Crowhaven's basement or farm were much better. * SPOILERS * First of all, for a scene as good as the scene of the bloody shower, you have a scene like that of the opening scene. Oh my God! the garden hose comes alive to water some frisky teens! TERRIBLE. as well as what we understand from home ... it seems that she needs to use her video cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very moving house. not a spirit, a demon, or an entity, it's a "possessed" house, but by what? we are led to believe that an inanimate object has learned to love Suzie / Margarette, our protagonist? now that i'm on the subject of suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady is coming, tells you that she was your nurse, pours her heart, falls into the boiling pool, wrestling in the agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do? Is there a risk of being burned by her hands to save this poor old woman who came to warn her? no, she stays there and looks! playing in most cases was better than average for a horror movie, but that's where the positives end. for at least one more interesting and amusing horror movie about an inanimate object that kills people watching the bed of death: the bed that eats. I feel that people who have given such importance to this issue have not looked at it since it was first aired or remembered it scared them as children. this film deserved less.
