Did someone stop to realize what kind of film was produced here? Now, a former naval officer is being accused by a group of kids at a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? False. It may be an extremely stupid comedy at this point, but I found Damon Wayans' voice extremely irritating. Does he speak like that in real life? If he does then he has my sympathy but he will not earn my money watching his films
