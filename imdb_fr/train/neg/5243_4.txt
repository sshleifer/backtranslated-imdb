Forge your own opinion. Personally, I found it as fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. It may be a comedy, but I just found it stupid. These are not exactly the top two choices for keeping your kids. Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two sellers of energy drinks, were court-ordered to mentor two children at a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the unsuitable is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth grade student and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man who plays in a fantastic medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperately trying to give their accusations a precious vision of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with his dry-minded analogies. The fans are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
