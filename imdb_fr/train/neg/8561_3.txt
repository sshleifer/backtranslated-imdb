The Cowboys could leave you a little sad in the saddle. Certainly not one of John's best movies. Do not get me wrong, with any move from John Wayne, there are always good places. And this one has its fair share. But overall, the image moves slowly and simply does not match the aspirations it could have been. Bruce Dern is doing a great job again as a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another positive point of the film. The children in the film were average but could have been better interpreted. It would be a good movie for moviegoers from eight to fifteen years old. <br /> <br /> It would be a good family gesture to watch with your children. Just be aware that there are some scenes that you might want to take a look at before letting the kids see it. But most of the kids I know who have seen the movie like it. It may be because they see children of their age doing all the adult work.
