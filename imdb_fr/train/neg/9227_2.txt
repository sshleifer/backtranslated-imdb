CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every film I choose to see at the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film seemed to have been made by a film student for his intro. during cinema class. His father makes great movies. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! A critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godard's The Contempt. While Coppola, Jr. has taken the same idea, a film about the film, he has tried too hard to be European, artistic and witty, while it's really kitsch. The lead actor carries the same expression throughout the film, as if he was impressed or shocked by the fact that this film is shot around him. Schwartzman succeeds in one way or another in his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that has a real parodic humor is not that of the movie B, but the one that happens in Italy; a montage of shots of several different characters in a tiny car, driving to pick up and drop people at random. It was the only thing that reminded me of cinema, I guess he was trying to parody. Or scam. Or both. The documentary with the main movie talking about the camera and filming various objects was played, the end was marked for a "twist" or an artistic value ... I guess the funniest thing about this movie is the movie itself -Even, and not in the way provided. No wonder this film was returned after a screening at the festival to be re-released or re-shot, whatever, which makes me curious how bad it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse than that. If you want to see a good movie parody, take a look at Austin Powers movies. Any of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and more brilliant than all this film. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of cinema, THANK YOU back to making your cousin's music videos. Leave the godfathers to dad.
