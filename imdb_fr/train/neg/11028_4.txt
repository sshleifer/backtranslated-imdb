Near the beginning, after establishing that outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egocentric rapist, another 1930s bandit is stuck on a farm and surrounded by the FBI. Second in command, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), reviews the situation, puts a cigar light in his mouth, takes two automatic devices loaded .45 caliber and leaves alone in the distant house. Bang, Bang, Bang. Purvis leaves the house alone, carrying the woman hostage, the dead scoundrel. All in the long run. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as stupid. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his death dramatically. Multiple violations of the civic code. Many gunfights with Tommy pistols and pistols. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> The story stinks. Few people remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part, I guess, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who dismissed Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in search of public attention. <br /> <br /> The image was written and directed by John Milius. This is the guy who wrote in his contract that, if animals were to be slaughtered during one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy, a firearms maniac, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War shouting quotes from Henry V - "Saint Crispin" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete trash. "I knew I would never take it alive, and I did not try too much, either." That is to say, kill them all and let God solve them. <br /> <br /> You will love it.
