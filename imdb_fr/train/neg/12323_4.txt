As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music, the graphics and the created world are sumptuous and it really stands out from most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than that, I suggest you look elsewhere where. Beauty stops in front of its appearance and when it comes to intrigue and characters, there is nothing special about it. The action is slow and minimal and people are flat, sometimes tacky, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the intrigue here and the intrigue here ... So, in summary, oh my God, I've never seen anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my God, it's like ... -poke- people do not act like that. It has taken a giant step forward in graphics and music in cartoons, but also a few steps back in periods of poor characterization, and unfortunately, there is not even much action to compensate for that. ..
