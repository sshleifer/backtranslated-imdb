"The Bat People" is a very bad film that deserved as much the treatment of MST3K as this other movie "The Creeping Terror." . We see a lot of things happening, like flying bats, attacks, etc., break chases, emergencies and so much more! All this, plus the old-fashioned mediocrity of the 1970s (Hey, think of "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" one of the best of the latest episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" in the series! Moviewise, it's awful. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching you. <br /> <br /> "The people of bats" - rather "The bad people !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
