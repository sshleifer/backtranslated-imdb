The secret is ... this movie is blowing. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff I know what you did last summer and SCREAM, Beth, admirably played by Dorie Barton , joined several friends on a spring break trip. The group rents a luxury home and tries to spend a pleasant holiday. Then the dead begin. One, then another, then another friend is murdered, leading to a sad and mundane climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> A remark, Dorie Barton is the poor man's Reese Witherspoon, she looks like Reese, behaves like Reese and could pass for Reese in a queue against the police. Maybe that's how they threw it? Anyhoo, a decent cinematography and a fair game can not compensate for a bad dialogue and a terrible writing.
