This film by Oscar Petersson is unique. Its uniqueness does not lie in the story, because many half-brained Hollywood productions have served us comparatively miserable intrigues, but rather in the most minute way of associating total and total urination with an equal aspect. . /> <br /> The dialogue is worse than embarrassing. A rotten action and an abyssal direction are thrown into the mix. Bosnians speaking English with strong Swedish accents add an element of unintentional humor. Lightning and uninspired camera work are the icing on the cake in turkey film. As a kind of surprise for the public, there are some idle sequences completely unmotivated where we expect the least. To add insult to injury, everything is cut off by someone devoid of sense of timing. <br /> <br /> The "bad man goes well after hearing the good guy's speech" scene in the church, is the point to it's time to dethrone Ed Wood from his position as the worst director of all the temperature; Move on Ed Wood - this is Oscar Petersson!
