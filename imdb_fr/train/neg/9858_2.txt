This movie is not funny. It just takes D & D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters earn less than $ 30,000 a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially retarded and they have no chance with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative. Two players were beaten by a black negro because one of them was wearing a KKK-like hood (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had warmed up John Rocker (oh that's funny, that's is a nerd, so he does not know the sport). You may need to be a childish high school student to find these fun things. Badly made counterfeits are so painful to look at, but obviously extremely cheap to manufacture. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for pullets well beyond their peak.
