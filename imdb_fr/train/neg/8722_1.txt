Not to be confused with "Alligator" (1980) by Lewis Teague, which is actually an excellent film, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" painstakingly ends the exotic trilogy made by Sergio Martino in the late 70s (including including the rather watchable film "The Isola degli uomini pesce" and the less good "La Montagna del dio cannibal"). Extremely plot of the plot of "Jaws", the script does not succeed in creating a suspense. The creature is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable. The chant of Stelvio Cipriani is a poor illustration of the adventures of these idiotic tourists presented from the beginning as obvious elements of the meal of the reptile. No chills, rather laughs actually! And we could find this pitiful movie quite amusing if the dialogues and the appearance of the natives are not so clearly inspired by pure racism. Soon, laughter stops in favor of a bitter feeling of such a condescending attitude. We could excuse poorly made movies and poor currency effects, but not that kind of mentality. Never!
