I would not give a note to this film, it is not worthy. I watched it only because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I love her and I look at everything she did. Even in this failure, she did not disappoint. Every scene she was in, let the viewer look ... wait ... for something to happen, but nothing happened. There were good stories, but they ended abruptly from the beginning. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing had become. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she directed this film and is one of the most charming. The wardrobe and the set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can almost watch everything and rarely find a movie that I do not like, but it was a failure. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about all this, there was a big shed at the end. There was an end scene that woke you up and say wow, this movie is finally going somewhere, and then the credits. Good grief <br /> <br /> I agree with the opinion that .99 would have bought 3 boxes of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. Well said. In reality, this comment was more fun than the movie because it sums up so well. Me too, I lost 0.99 centime on this dud.dud.dud.
