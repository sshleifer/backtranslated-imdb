When I call Malice film noir, I do not compare it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, or compare director Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel . I'm just writing a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from beginning to end, so much so that you simply can not understand what's going on. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this movie was dark, even in daylight, why I'm unable to understand. As things stand, however, director Becker would not have made a film.
