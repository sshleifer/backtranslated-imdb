It's hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovny was at the height of his glory, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series of all time, at the height of fame. Nine years later, he is almost forgotten and his attempts to do it on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain why, he is an honest actor, but his moment of glory has probably placed him in an eternal role in which he needs a lot of talent. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well known. and she was very lucky that a film like "Playing God" did not lead her career into a dead end. Fortunately for her, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" were waiting for her beyond the corner and when Lara Croft arrived, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> There is not much to tell about it. movie. It's Andy Wilson's only big-screen movie, and there must be a reason. Everything is trivial and most of what happens on the screen is expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a victim by shooting in a bar and then end up working for the crowd. The off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moralistic text that kills any nuance of cinematic experience of the film. You will probably not encounter the movie but in DVD rental stores or on TV. Try to look for something better.
