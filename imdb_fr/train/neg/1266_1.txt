If there is a hell, it contains a projection room in which GRAND CANYON plays again and again on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Woodard Albr, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help to compensate for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own movies for eternity). . But no. Apparently, they injected these other actors with a McDonnell-based serum. The whole affair is pretentious, overwhelmed, insulting (if you are deaf or if you know someone who is deaf, prepare for your blood boils during the ridiculous scene of TDD). GRAND CANYON is filled with unpleasant people, engaged in their own business, but never gives us a reason to love / understand / sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers without which the gene pool would be better. There is no plot to speak of, no character development (these people will NEVER develop), no escape performance and the most archy writing you'll ever encounter in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? His title. It's a big hole in a movie.
