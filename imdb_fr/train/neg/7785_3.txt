I did not know it was a silent movie with narration. I do not like silent movies - nerdy humor, flickering lights and movies, and so on. I was talking about chapter 8 before finding an interest in this story and, if I had popcorn, I might have thrown it on the screen. Maybe it appeals to the science fiction crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there was a total of 6 people throughout the theater. Isabella Rosselinni recounted this film - the only pleasant aspect of the film. Nobody left commenting on how much they appreciated that, nor appreciated the unusual approach of telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
