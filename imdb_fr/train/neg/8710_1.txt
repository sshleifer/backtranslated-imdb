I did not see the first two - only this one called Primal Species in England. But I do not think I'll bother to watch them. <br /> <br /> It's an awful movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything is so bad. The most sympathetic characters die very quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially the one called Polchak, who is an incredible fool. Nobody like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. It lasted a long time, but I was delighted when he finally had his head - I was having nightmares, he was going to survive. The colonel was also bad. All moods and cries without any idea. And the mischievous doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porn. I waited for her to remove her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a vampire, but she did not. Too bad the film was animated endlessly. <br /> <br /> Did not Roger Corman make half-decent movies once?
