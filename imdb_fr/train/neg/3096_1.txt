For starters, "Hobgoblins" tries to ape the more successful "Gremlins". It's bad enough, but they do not even try to do something that looks a lot like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a boon, staged awkward scenes, inappropriate sound effects, a bland tasteless tapioca, and a scenario that takes everything humans hold sacred to. their movies and throws them in the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr ... Mediocre kids track down Gremlin-like creatures in a movie before killing people by projecting their fantasies. Sounds cool, does not it? You see this wall on the other side of your room? Run straight on, at full speed, face forward. You see, it's cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quick, name something other than one of the tracks was other than that. What other scripts have the authors made since "Hobgoblins"? Name another effort by Rick Sloane's management. How many "Hobgoblins" figurines do you have? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it took me so long to write about such a horrible movie. I prefer to write about more important things. like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that sort of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" it's true and it's bad - bad like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad like pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underclothes that say "Whopper House". .. and I think we'll stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots are fighting valiantly, but they can not do the same with "Hobgoblins" before realizing that, yes, the director DOES NOT need to hurt himself to the shin. <br /> Really very hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
