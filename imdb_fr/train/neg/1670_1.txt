The premise of the film is spooky: a woman gets pregnant when she is kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie starts, a horrendous opening scene establishes that it's a Sci-Fi C movie type movie. It's a big Star Trek and a few X files, but it's mostly boring. <br /> <br /> When the film goes into action, everything is predictable and clich√©. It looked more like a partner in a bad science fiction TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but not for lack of trying. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
