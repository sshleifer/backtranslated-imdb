Funny romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood on the romantic relationship between an elegant hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent from Los Angeles at the age of his beautiful years (William Holden, surprisingly affable in this arrangement very concocted ). The script is light but not without some thoughtful passages; Yet the screenplay has become such a mid-age clich√© that most of the image is childish to say the least. It may have worked much better with different tracks: Holden and Lenz do not agree (its size is so light that it seems to dominate it), making their intimate scenes less appealing than simply uncomfortable. Dated, blurry-romantic, and mostly immemorial. ** from ****
