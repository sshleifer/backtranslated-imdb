A low-budget Texas effort that has at least filmed well, but that's hardly comforting. Bad acting or, should I say, a bad overplay, a beautiful story that is nothing new, bad effects special, bad, bad, bad. It looks like a group of young people are building a haunted house for Halloween, which happens every year, but this year things are different. Has a long lesbian theme that is not only boring, but definitely fills the empty spaces, which are numerous. Putrid, childish, to avoid absolutely.
