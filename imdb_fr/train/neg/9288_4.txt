Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the lead role, was a big hit in the B series. Half Past Dead 2 is just a sequel to videos, an action movie that loses nothing but can not win anything . It's less fun than the first: in all aspects. But it's worth a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch WWE's old stars on screen or even like watching sequels, whether direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, he thinks he's not good for work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the work, but nothing amazing, nothing is far from right. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, a Sony production can not be excellent. Cinematography was a disaster but the general direction was acceptable. It does not matter, look at it if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
