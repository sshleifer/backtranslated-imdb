Although it is not a "good film", it contains something attractive and memorable. Like another commentator of the film, I saw this in childhood. It's been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten history or its ridiculously heavy title. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of the life of a small town over the decades. More than any other film, it brings a human face to the historical drama of the "progress" of the early twentieth century. It's quite attractive for a young spectator and quite memorable for an older one. In addition, it is easy to love the characters and watch their passage in time.
