Considering that this movie had had a serious and quite successful launch campaign, I was expecting something to be worth it ... from the beginning (in which the two brothers caress each other "sensually", lying naked in a bed) it goes down quickly ... nothing to attract attention, not a catchy thing in all the intrigue, baaad baad (with some minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not analyze either in depth (know that a possible excuse for the authors, claiming they were targeting a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial means the same thing ...). Too curious spectators will not get any interesting scene ... at this point, it could have saved part of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said ... but look at the film yourself ... I am an egotist and I would like as many people as possible to lose about 1 1/2 hours of their life ... as I did :(
