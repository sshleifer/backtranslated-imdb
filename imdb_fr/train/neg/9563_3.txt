This is vaguely based on the ideas of the original hit of the 80s. It is happening now as we see a base in Afghanistan destroyed by a drone from the beginning. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie makes the shark jump. UAVs are not armed. They might be, but I do not think it has ever been tried for real. We see the computer that ran this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to "computer hacker" Will Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics, which does not make him a hacker) and his love interest, Annie) and Will's first hacking attempt is not just a complete failure, her IP address is also connected and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet a mother of Wills who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills takes money from the bank account of his neighbor (Mr. Massude) is not a hack (he helped him open the account), we get a nod then eye to the original movie where they decided not to play Global Thermonuclear War and The Dead Code. The trace that RIPLEY's office uses is NOT on Will, but on Massude's PC. All the evidence collected was therefore useless against Will. <br /> <br /> The exact reason why RIPLEY closed Will's machine is not explained (he's just playing a game online?) and also why he felt the need to cut the whole thing electricity of the whole block in which he lived. Why an anti-terrorism agency would consider this a viable target is extremely debatable. As far as RIPLEY activate his mobile phone? I think no, he was not connected to the PC and the message would not be broadcast if he did not answer the phone. So there are still more "bad hacking techniques". <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude, take him away and Will receives an envelope containing a lot of money. Looking for the license plate of the car that took away Massude is not a "hack" since you will never see it enter the DMV computer. RIPLEY officers who seize Dennis at the airport while looking for him have no power to arrest or detain him. Will's mother had also not "stolen chemicals and biological agents". And even if she did, they did not have the right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will was worried about being arrested for a crime in Canada, because it's a totally different country with different laws from the United States. <br /> <br /> The computer has become a thug and all the measures taken against Will, his mother and Dennis have not been sanctioned by a government agency. The phone phreak we see that Will do is the first show of any hacking talent in the movie. We also hacked RIPLEY, which seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "guy" who ran into Annie at the airport and watched them in the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY & the laughable idea that RIPLEY could track down a cell phone underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the system replaced by RIPLEY, the Joshua Project. We discover that the "guy" who met Annie is Falken (not played sadly by the original actor) who simulated his own death. <br /> <br /> We can also see in WOPR what will help them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used at the time.Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being barely used (the the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and the Russian, and it is unlikely that they will create an autonomous computer system capable of neutralizing or dropping chemical weapons in the country in which it operates. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy and the idea of ​​"decontamination" is totally unbelievable.These kind of ordinances should go through the president or the chief of staff, again again laughable and unbelievable. > IP hacks against RIPLEY are not made by Will, he simply contacts one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea It is exceedingly laughable that Will gets an identifier just by increasing the functioning of RIPLEY Have Joshua in RIPLEY (especially after making it explode into pieces) is an incredible escape and screams from a very desperate writer who had no idea and wanted to finish this film. /> <br /> There is a very bad place where RIPLE Y plays Dead Code and we see a countdown (17 minutes) then RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes". How can it be boring when they can not even follow their own stopwatch? RIPLEY's attack on Philadelphia is stopped (far too easily in my opinion) and he decides to attack Joshua in his internal circuits and redirects the missile directed to Philadelphia where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​the nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY understand that what she is doing will not work (she would already know if Joshua had already initiated it because he had already learned this lesson in the original film? ) the original movie. <br /> <br /> Their attempt to have RIPLEY repeat Joshua's exact words at the end of the original film shows the number of original ideas they could not find. <br /> <br /> If you want to point out the wrong ideas and stolen ideas, the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. It's a horrible film and you better avoid it.
