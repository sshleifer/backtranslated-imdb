It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's EXTREMELY boring, with lots of annoying dialogues, VERY annoying characters and a laughable creature. The only reason I looked at this trash was because it was this 8-disc horror set I had. The plot is absurd and totally stupid, just like the finale. No blood whatsoever except some bloody tracks on the creature and some gunshot wounds. The acting is terrible !! Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is comic relief and was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was not funny either. Bob Hyman is decent but not much more than that. Richard Garrison is boring and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb whatsoever. Kacey Cobb is so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Overall, avoid this waste at all costs! BOMB on 5.
