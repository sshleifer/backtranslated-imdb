Oh my God, I had to see that when I was only 11 or 12 years old (do not ask me how) I may have been young, but I was not stupid. Everyone could see that it was a bad film, nasty, disgusting, scary and very ridiculous. I saw more impressive effects at Disneyland, better performance at a school play, and I saw more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water , ignoring the children tapping on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious youngsters are experimenting with a new water sport, surfing in water filled with sharks. It soon becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. Once they have learned what, they got the help of a middle-aged grizzly fisherman, who wants to kill the animal in order to avenge his family's meal. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen all the crocodile films made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst is its sequel. Blood Surf should be the second crocodile movie with, in my opinion, Primeval and Crocodile lagging behind. injuries or deaths each year. Movies like Blood Surf spoil not only the fierce image of such a creature, but also a good hour and a half of the spectator's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
