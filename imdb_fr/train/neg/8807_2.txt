I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who seem to have been infected with a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> FILM VERY POOR BAD. <br /> <br /> * My spleen: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
