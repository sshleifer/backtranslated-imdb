Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the greatest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap movies, many of which were parodies of Hollywood's great traits. Following an argument with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock's smaller (and more indigent) production company. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody movies were barely funny at the time and even less funny. for the modern audience who has not seen the original movie that Laurel parodies. 'West of Hot Dog' is a rather generic parody of shoot-'em-ups of cowboys. This is partly a parody of "West of the Pecos", a version published two years earlier, without any major player. As "West of the Pecos" has never been a resounding success, it's hard to see why Stan's film unit chose this film as a target for his lamery, let alone why they waited so long after his exit to parody it. And where did they get this title "West of Hot Dog"? Maybe it's due to the fact that 'Hot dog!' was a sexual interjection favored by the American Lechers in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the play "Machinal".) <br /> <br /> "West of Hot Dog" was produced and co-directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other accomplishments, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson and he was later the best man of their marriage. Full Disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of befriending and interviewing Joe Rock. Nearly ninety at the time, Rock's memory was impressive ... but he did not remember anything about 'West of Hot Dog', and I can not blame him. This film is eminently forgettable. <br /> <br /> The main character of the lady is called Little Mustard: if it's a parody of something in "West of the Pecos", I do not have it. There are some "impossible" gags here, including Laurel's method of riding a horse. For a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly escaped. The subject and tone of "West of Hot Dog" are vaguely similar to those of Keaton's short comedy "The Frozen North," but Keaton's version is a lot more fun. The plot of this film anticipates somewhat the situation in Keaton's feature film "Our hospitality", but (again) suffers: here two very hard brothers are hoping to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the former owner bequeathed it to Stan. However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, is such a legacy legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, any other matter of ownership or inheritance will surely become his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this monotonous comedy. <br /> <br /> At one point, a gag implies a coarse animation shot directly at the stock of the film. It looks cheap and is not funny. <br /> <br /> This "hot dog" is neither a winner nor a winner: it's just a roar. My note: a point out of 10. Wait, Stan: in a few years, you'll be half of a comedy legend.
