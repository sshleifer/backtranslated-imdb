Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons who dubiously claimed "relatively good track record" in forecasting <br /> <br /> In his widely commented comments, the January 2 edition of Christian Broadcasting Network's The 700 Club , during which he predicted it would be "very serious terrorist attacks" and "massive massacres" in the United States during the "second semester" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted of "relatively good track record "with previous forecasts. But a review of Robertson's forecasts for the New Year 2006 weakens this assertion. He predicted, for example, that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will strengthen himself." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The autumn elections will not be conclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in control." FALSE <br /> <br /> * "The war in Iraq will end successfully and we will start withdrawing our troops by the end of this year." In addition, as reported in an Associated Press article on Jan. 3, Robertson has a history of questionable predictions: <br /> <br /> Broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election. Bush won 51% of the vote this fall, beating Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. FALSE <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would win victory after victory in his second term. He said the social security reform proposals would be approved YET! <br /> <br /> He claims to speak directly with God ... If so, God has a sense of humor by watching Pat mock himself again and again ...
