It was the worst movie I have ever seen and I saw a lot of bad movies. First, I come from Kansas, this movie has no truth. It's as if they take the name of BTK and compose the rest. On top of that, it looks like someone looks like they only have $ 20 here, take it and make a movie and oh yeah, do not worry about looking on btk, just invent something . seriously pure dookie nobody should ever see this movie. The scenes of cows slaughter and forcing their victims to eat stuff and describing the slaughter of animals BTK did not do anything but the film does it for God's sake never sees this horrible movie. Those designed for television are much better and much more accurate
