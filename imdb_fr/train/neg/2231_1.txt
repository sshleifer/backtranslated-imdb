All I can say after watching Snitch'd is to arrest Mr. Cahill, please. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what you are doing movies. If you insist on making movies about gangsters, I urge you to do some research. It's funny to watch movies with absurd gangbangs that sound even more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I made fun of the game when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and starts kicking himself in Fu's kung mode. This movie was difficult as special after school. Who had the idea to wear hats indicating the origin of a gangbanger in particular? I suspect that real gangs do not wear a hat claiming there is a gang. That would be stupid given the new laws that add length to jail time if a person is linked to a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbangers movie ever made.
