As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was eager to see this movie. I'm unhappy to see that it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is neither persuasive nor realistic enough to represent Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows Notorious B.I.G.'s real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. like a kid. Unfortunately, it is not convincing enough to pay homage to his father. Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In a word, no one is convincing enough to play his role here. The big problem with this is that they are real people that they play. It was boring and gave no information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans did not know it already. Angela Bassett, a very good actress lost here in the role of Voletta Wallace, particularly disappointed me. The film hangs out and thinks that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that this has happened. It's far from being a good movie. I was waiting for so many things, but unfortunately, I did not get anything from what I wanted. I think you should definitely skip this one.
