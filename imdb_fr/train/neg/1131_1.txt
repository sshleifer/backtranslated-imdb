It's a pity that even a talented director, Desplechin, failed to get a decent performance from a dreary actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn does not have the substance to convey a very concise storyline and clear. To try to fill the concentric circle of the critical situation of an actor, the performance and the presentation are too artificial and poorly executed to attract any sympathy of the spectator. Over a long period of time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the scenario to a fragile frame of a catastrophic display. The content is incoherent and free as Phoenix strives to follow Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is supposed to try to do the same. Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory from Phoenix's talent.
