Here we go with another slasher movie, Beautiful people and It is very good to act from everyone! <br /> <br /> Few children play jokes and parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Once again, they start doing phone tricks again! and then the killer returns kills them one by one and the killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with an ax exactly like the movie Urban Legend, <br /> <br /> The scene of the dead is really weird, very weird too. <br /> <br /> A nice slasher movie at this part would give 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the movie a little useless. <br /> <br /> Twist killed the movie for me so I'll give it 4/10
