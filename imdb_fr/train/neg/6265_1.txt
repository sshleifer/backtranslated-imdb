I am the nephew of the director. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can confirm that this is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle does not even have a copy (I asked him). I can not wait to bring him a copy. <br /> <br /> The average score of the movie is currently 1.9 / 10. As far as I know, this should place it somewhere around the mid-thirties in the "100 base" of the IMDb. However, with only 206 votes, it has not yet been ranked. the film does not even enjoy the respect of the last 100 titles. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm giving copies of the film to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / worst gift of our life?
