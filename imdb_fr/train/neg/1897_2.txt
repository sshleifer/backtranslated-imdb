It was a horrible film! I gave her 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and a second for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... Other than that, the story is completely nil and the cars circulating in the cities were not so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably what bored me the most, rarely saw something so constructed!
