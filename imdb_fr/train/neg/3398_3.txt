It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (mafia-like) character of the Russians, or at least those Russians capable of traveling outside their great country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so inefficient that they can not find the person who stole the bank, even when they leave the country by plane. Moreover, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke an unidentified language nowhere, probably spoken by extraterrestrials in the Ural mountains, but far from being Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, go kindly to Moscow or St. Petersburg and take care to learn grammar and pronunciation.
