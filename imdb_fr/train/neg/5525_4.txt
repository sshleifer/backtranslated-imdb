The problem with family dramas is that apart from TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those who are watched tend to be sensationalist and deal with current or current issues or hot topics (or recent events). Movies that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Especially with the young crowd that would be the base of Miss Lohan fans or the younger crowd that tends to make not only popular movies but financially prosperous for the studios. some of the characterizations. It's a bit to blame for all the behavior of the character Lohan (destruction of the car, drug use, etc.) on what his father-in-law did to him. Although it is not implausible, it is just a little difficult to wait for the public to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as giving the young Morman boy, oral sex, or that she would make a good assistant to the vet, who happens to have something by chance for his mother, etc., all these elements just not really helping this movie along. This placed him more in the aspect of a sitcom trying one of their "special dramatic episodes" than for a fully realized and well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch the DVD and listen to the comment, especially for the different alternative purposes, you can really see that all this is a sharp focus.
