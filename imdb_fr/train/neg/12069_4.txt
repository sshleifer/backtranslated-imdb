Carl Monson, a Z-level horror filmmaker, has been one of the most prolific filmmakers in the field of low-budget gore mayhem. His films are bursting with inept gore, risky gambling, boring sub-intrigue and dialogue. A mysterious figure savagely murders guests staying in the family mansion. Unfortunately, this film is almost bloodless.You do not see the murders, except with shadows and some splash of blood.The step is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting.The players play competent, but the lack of blood and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Be careful: do not confuse the Monson movie with Andy Milligan's "Legacy of Blood", also weak.
