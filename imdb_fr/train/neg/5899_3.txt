In the opinion of all fans, Miike and his work did the same. I sat through this movie tonight. I figured that if it's about as good as Ringu, as I had supposed from these comments, it will be worth my time. <br /> <br /> No luck. <br /> <br /> I'm all about finding the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is that one. I do not have a Master of Fine Arts from New York University, but I know it very well: a horror movie must be punctuated. It must also give more credulity to the viewer than this film. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this film made me shake my head. Some scenes near the end were so drawn that I went to the fridge and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for minutes, eyes wide open and gaping. A famous director once made this statement, and I paraphrase, a film could be made by turning on the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it spin. Kou is not good enough actress to do this job. She looks at the girl of the undead paralyzed for more scenes than I remember. And she is not the only one posing as a deer; the other members of the cast apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The scenario leaves them little room for too much time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong action movies from the last 30 years, Korean horror movies like "Phone" and "Koma", works by Ang Lee, filthy but fun Filipino movies with free sex and fights, as well as d 'other. Chakushin Ari, I could have done without it.
