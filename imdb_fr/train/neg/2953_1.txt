Those critics who claim that this film is so bad that its good will exaggerate with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure that Leonard, Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These movies were fun in their horror but this pile of dinosaur poop is so painful that it is painful. I have not had so much trouble watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before you start the exam, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust that The New Line Cinema has refused to put on the floor. They reduced the losses by sending it directly to the video, making it the most expensive live movie in decades. Whoopi gave in to be in this disaster after a big paycheck. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: A millionaire dinosaur clone in order to launch missiles in the sun that would kill humanity and trigger a new ice age. Katie Coltrane, a policewoman, and Theodore Rex, an idiotic dinosaur, team up reluctantly to stop him after the death of a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The plot is presented to you at the beginning of the film which steals the film from all its mystery. Then you have to face the fact that this movie is actually pretty awful. Whoopi seems agitated and tries to cope with his performance, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is downright irritating and his clumsy behavior runs out after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him, threatening to bite people and hit people with his tail (accidentally and voluntarily). I thought that burglar was bad, but Theodore Rex was the worst film of Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is serious enough to please. I did not see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who must have had a sickly admiration for Howard The Duck. The humor is at this level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's cousin. Completely painful from beginning to end.
