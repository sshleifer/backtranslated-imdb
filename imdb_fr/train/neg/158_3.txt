Spoilers warning following. Superb reconstruction of the Antarctic base where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, defamatory!, Scandalous! Shot in Canada presumably by a crew and essentially Canadian actors. I recently watched the last half of this film on Global TV here in Canada. Nothing more to say than the consternation I felt at how much this American historical revisionist propaganda was flagrant; and featuring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian director, Roger Spottiswoode, was forced to make the US Air Force the hero of the film, when they were actually real lifeguards of a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
