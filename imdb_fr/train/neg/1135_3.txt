I did not read Lincoln's biography, so maybe it was an accurate representation ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe that's because I'm used to as alienating and unrealistic as Lincoln's abnormal divinations as brilliant, honorable and savior of our country ...... <br /> <br /> But why would they make a film depicting Lincoln as a jester? While Henry Fonda was doing an excellent Lincoln, his interpretation of "aw shucks, I'm just a boy" seemed a little insulting. <br /> <br /> [Okay, that was all the pomp of Bushie Jr. campaign, to make us believe he was "just an ordinary guy", so we would not care, he's a rich and privileged moron - but it's a whole different story. <br /> <br /> Not only does the movie show the kind of guy to Lincoln (almost simple-minded), the film says that Lincoln has gone into the law by accident, and that he was not even interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of ​​the law being about rights and wrongs. In the film, he is not a very good defense lawyer (he walks barefoot on the table and mocks the witnesses), and the result is mainly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, in part, because it was funded by the Republicans (in reaction to a Democrat-sponsored play that was released) and partly because it was just the feeling of time , the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this movie!
