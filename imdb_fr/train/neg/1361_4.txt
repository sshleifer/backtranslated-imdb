I was excited to discover this comedy from the late sixties with some of my favorite characters: Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was so aggravated when I discovered that the film did not work as a comedy or a perfect film. Ustinov plays a little crook out of prison who installs his sites in a large American company based in London. Blocking his way in front of sumptuous CEO Karl Malden and technology geek, Newhart, Ustinov poses as a computer scientist and immediately plans the "perfect flight" part of the film. To do this, it must have a tamper-proof security system that protects the company's mainframe. And here is the problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone in the movie is remarkably confident and stupid. His lame excuses are taken for cash and this must be the only computer center not to bother with video cameras. The second problem is that the holdup (fraud) occurs in the first 30 minutes of the film, depriving the rest of the image of a lot of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is unfortunately poorly received as a neighbor / neighbor secretary of the little lady of Ustinov who simply can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she just seems too together here, too composed, the role more of a wacky and physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry together, it may be the difference in age, but the last romantic relationship, as devoid of romance as it is, remains a bit scary. Ustinov co-wrote the screenplay, and it was well thought of at the time, but I found the scenario a bit funny, sinuous and sad waste of a big distribution.
