With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you think this one will not be wrong. But what can I say? It was a horrible failure. The film is about Peter Sellers as an old gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention Goldie Hawn's seductive hippie. The film is incredibly disjointed and I did not understand it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this film does not prove it. <br /> <br /> This song about "Arabella Cinderella" is pretty cool, but that's it. I only recommend this movie to people who like to watch an extreme novelty movie, it's almost the definition of one. I guess this movie is more than anything else a sign of the times. With regard to its certain experimentalism and its unconventional character, the problem is that the quality is completely turned and that the writing, not to mention the direction, is so precise. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers in particular is very random, he will move from Dr. Strangelove to Being There throughout his career at silly movies like this one and the Magic Christian, which was very similar to that of context and style, but this film had some fun moments. This one is crazy, and I'm sad that someone as big as Peter Sellers has been in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
