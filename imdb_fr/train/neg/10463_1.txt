This film had so many promises. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, it was at best laughable, at worst painful. The game styles range from very, really, flat (angels, woman and girl) to animation (Casper's character). I got the impression that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the public rather than real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene concerning "the bug". It's quite insulting to the public's ability to understand things. In defense of this scene, however, he had the biggest laugh about the whole movie. I had read that they spent a lot of money going to various places abroad. Too bad they did not use it. I did not feel transported to exotic places. Anyone can insert archive footage of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to conclude on a positive note, I found that the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics displayed on the decoding computers. It's my opinion (and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much lower and the ACTION factor significantly increased, this movie would have been good.
