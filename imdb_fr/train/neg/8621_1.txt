The previous poster obviously worked on the film. It's a joke to say how bad it is and no one would want to see this kind of film again as it did. Mentioning all the names of the actors and their previous content is a sure sign that he is involved in one way or another. <Br/> <br /> It's on Cinemax right now and I'm sure it was a movie in which pornstars (the one he calls Ava is beautiful and well endowed) were forced to do something else for an insane fiscal reason. <br /> <Moreover, when I first saw it, I was sure it was made around 1986 and that I was born in 1973, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... it was done in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Even if I say it's such a bad movie it's good. Like watching a train wreck.
