After the disastrous success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films are spreading like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is quite in movies like El segundo number, a similar production on poorly written television, but that plays and turns even worse. I did not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of La poup√©e who ate his mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs unless you're looking for a peaceful, sleepy night in a new movie theater. 2/10
