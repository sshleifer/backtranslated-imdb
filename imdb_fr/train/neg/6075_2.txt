One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a useless cliche of a slasher exercise. He's trying to change the genre with the absurd intrigue of a fan turned psychotic mad - the movie snakes in nothing. (spoiler) We must believe that an idiot with a knife has access to a baseball player and the murder in a sumptuous hotel without witness, security or camera. The film is nonsense, we try to pull our heart to the heart of the underworld of baseball to finish mocking and complicated. I do not know what all the actors thought when they embarked on this film. This is a big flop as they come. Stay away if you prefer to think in your movies
