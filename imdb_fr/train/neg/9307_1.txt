I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH'. The acting is so bad that I saw kids in high school do a better job. All the actors seem to be reading their lines, without feeling or emotion, and no place to capture the viewer. On another note, the special effects were incredibly tacky and it looked like everyone could buy a radio. <br /> <br /> The clown itself is nothing like the jacket of the video. Heck, he does not even appear in the movie before the end and all he does is humming songs and stalking some characters. There is no real murder shown either, so it's not a real slasher movie either. Since I saw it, I asked a few questions. clowns? 2. If your friend disappears, why would you go out into the woods to make love rather than looking for her? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why was the only real actor broken in the end all of a sudden? Have the actors finally decided to make efforts in their work? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it because you would not lose an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
