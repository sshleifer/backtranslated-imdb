Comedy Central has been successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapel Show, Mind of Mencia, the Daily Show and the huge popular Colbert Report comics are all professional comics. All are, or in the case of Chapelle Show, solid shows. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the industry, I was expecting good things when I listen. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some funny sequences, but since the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show could have been much better. He was just the pilot, and I hope next week's show will be better. If not, ask for help in the form of best writers for the series.
