This film is quite horrible but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was shot in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona. Many of the film's extras are drama students from the NAU. I was a freshman there that year, with a minor in the theater, but for some reason I did not participate in the production. However, I knew several people who did and can provide this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this film where two of the directors, as part of their hazing ritual, have to run naked in the woods. They are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. The fact is that they are not actors at all, but two types that I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "later stuntmen" will remain anonymous, at least for this site, unless they decide, uh, to "reveal themselves"!
