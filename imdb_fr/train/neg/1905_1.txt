I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comics and I've probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. All the films he made early in his career in the early 1930s, with two exceptions, were reviewed. So you can say that I am a big fan. That's why I found this episode so painful and hard to watch. I loved this man's movies and I kept thinking "Buster, how can you ?!" Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can understand why Buster Keaton played in that awful episode of THE TWILIGHT. He had lost much of his fortune after a difficult divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was also over. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed this money and loved his popularity, so he lamented in front of all those who were willing to pay - appearing in Beach movies and the disaster of an episode of a big series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this episode is that it is just written terribly and that Buster deserved a lot better. The series is supposed to be funny but is not and instead of paying homage to silent films, it's painful to watch - especially with Keaton putting this stupid travel helmet over time as well as all poorly executed slapstick . Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of the greatness that was once Keaton's career !!!
