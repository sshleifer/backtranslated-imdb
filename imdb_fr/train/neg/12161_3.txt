"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially a "fatal attraction" with some added twists on the back half. The end will not surprise those who have seen more than two or three films of the week. It is another edifying account of succumbing to temptation and it adds nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who has a large trust fund. Even if he has everything, he risks losing everything by starting a temporary adventure with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a doe-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, has a crush on Brett, and she does not stand him particularly well when he clearly says his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett was found dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When police question Brett, he quickly points to Janet. Following her arrest, Janet seems to be getting bigger, to the minute - even if she had never been so stable. His defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is determined to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or not? How are you going to finish? You can find the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" airs on your local channel. And make sure you do not miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
