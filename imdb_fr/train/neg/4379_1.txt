<br /> <br /> Ok, well, I rented this movie while I was bedridden, I jumped on painkillers, and I said it did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who buys a car while he's in a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything, one day his wife decides to borrow the car car. Since I do not want to spoil (not that there is nothing to ruin), I will leave it to your imagination to understand the "Zany" (and I use this word lightly) the antics that follow. <br /> <br /> fight to stay awake through this snoring a minute of sleep from a movie, and I would like to say that if you venture into the movie store and you think you're adventurous, please do not losing it is a waste of the film that it was printed on. <br /> <br /> Again, I could be wrong ...
