This film causes more involuntary laughter than anything I've ever seen. Really, if you're a fan of Tolkien, just hire him to laugh with your friends. I will not be the millionth person to tear up its flaws ... all I'll say is that the film (for me, anyway) has lost important points for transforming my favorite character, Sam, into one. brazen idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
