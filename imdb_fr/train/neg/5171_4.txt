Good horror film about a beautiful suburban family struggling with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement they constantly feed to feed the people they pick up in the street. Of course, there is more than that to say, but to say more, it would be revealing. <br /> <br /> For me, this has not yet materialized, because it tries to do both ways, both as family drama and horror film. the film tries very hard to differentiate between the two genres, but seems to stumble in all directions while trying to be shocking, which is never the case. It does not help that the final revelation is less a fear than an "oh" like "Oh, that's it?" Maybe if I had not watched so many horror movies recently, it might have been better or it seemed right, since I would not have compared it to so much. <br /> <br /> I would take a pass
