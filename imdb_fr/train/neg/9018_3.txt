This is a science fiction film of formula B, and the director did not hide it. It is a dragon that is brought back to life by a scientific team. Everything is done, that's what you've seen many times. It's a weak script, without real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypes and situations. The director tackles this problem by turning it into a film formula, without any attempt to deceive us, which gives this film a moderate appeal, but you probably will not remember it for long. It is best to see it while cooking, cleaning, working. A kind of stupid fun. It has a place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you can watch with friends, unless you're all drunk and you do not care. The 3.2 mass rating is probably right. I do not think it's as crappy as most people, but I'm surprised some people in the publications thought it was spectacular. It really escapes me because I do not see any attempt to make this film a memorable one.
