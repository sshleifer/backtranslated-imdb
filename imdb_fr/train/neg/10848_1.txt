By all accounts, this could have been an interesting movie. Featuring a score of the mighty Cradle Of Filth, featuring singer Dani and excited about the title "the future of British horror", I was expecting Alex Chandon's gore festival to be on height of hype. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is either a cliché or an incompetent. The configuration of the anthology of the new story was made until death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Certainly, the idea of ​​"the room of the patient" made me cold in the back, but as in most cases, the film was disappointed by bad writing and bad scripting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write dialogue. All the sentences pronounced with the chief investigator of the police are full of swearing and insolence (typical formula of the "cop on the wire." Funny, I am sure to have already seen it elsewhere elsewhere) No Chandon you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It seems bad. Add ridiculously OTT to the crazy cast (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but he's not an actor) and the performances are beyond laughing. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are generally poor, with some atrocious CGI, huge effects gores (for reasons of goodness, Peter Jackson has improved and it was more than ten years with less budget) and editing filters that scream ON-USE! As for the often wrong use of the Cradle Of Filth score, man, they have to sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem of Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously by trying to create an atmosphere conducive to terror and terror. repulsion in his audience. too many good horror movies made in the seventies and eighties do so much better with much higher gore effects (eg: manic, zombie flesh eaters, the afterlife, suspiria, etc.). ), which makes Cradle of Fear obsolete. <br /> <br /> I hope that Chandon can learn from this horrific ghoul of a film and continue to create a scary quality horror. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
