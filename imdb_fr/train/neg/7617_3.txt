It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, but the hostel is definitely a lot worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary. I laughed most of the time when I watched him. Low quality effects (when you go watch it, you'll understand what I'm talking about and how the quality is low), the bad actors (I hear about it for the first time), and it looks like it's an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to watch it all the way. Do you like comedy? Look at this. Want horror? Go watch Ju-On: The Grudge or another good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I talk about the legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify it in a kind of Horror. Just a shit on a budget. <br /> <br /> I rate it 3 out of 10
