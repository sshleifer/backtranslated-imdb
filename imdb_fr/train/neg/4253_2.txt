It must be one of the worst vampire attacks ever made by men. How to turn such a fascinating subject into a totally meaningless story? Apparently, it's not such a difficult task ... First of all, a sine qua non condition of any vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a sexy, sexy touch, which lacks all of these things. oh my god, why, in the name of Christ / Judas, was that about? <br /> <br /> Whenever Dracula arrived, he was devoured by the light (in the scenario keeping it low, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that was almost worth it to be watched towards the end of the film (magnificent dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first, the Judas-twist was really original, but this one is not good, not at all. Let's hope that the third will carry the signature of the vampire that I love so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or Interview with the vampire.
