Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as a Capulet, although it is his usual neigh and neigh and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Brother Laurence although he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good like Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. The Benvolio of Christopher Strauli is nice. <br /> <br /> The sets are pretty, not to say sensational, as in some other BBC Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> And there you are. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire was 15 years old during the production and is not sure how to interpret Juliet. She opens her eyes wide and moans each line in the same way. Patrick Ryecart is badly matched to her and her self-esteem is inexplicable. The balcony scene runs smoothly and without any emotional or erotic impact. Their death is a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have given them a few hours earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unworthy of Mercutio, a shock if you remember his great work in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand fragments of two or three words, then shouts the fragments as disconnected and incomprehensible as possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Awful. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of placing the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening fight is particularly incoherent. However, there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently puts Tybalt on his knees just in shoemakers. Tybalt then seizes the offended region. However, did it succeed? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom or for many other things.
