The Earth is destined to no longer be thanks to Father Pergado and a group of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was tricked into appearing in this movie by his producers who told him that many great actors were involved) was Father Pergado and had to do his usual serious and scary routine. The actors are not that bad, although most have now retired. The film has dreadful sound effects (it seems to be mainly by pressing keys on an old computer) and it annoys ridiculously at times, showing a scene from the sky, for example, for hours at a time. In spite of this, the story is rather humorous in an unreal genre and the production is adequate. Interestingly, a scene presents Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Meda Band; Frank Ray Perilli, writer, and Bennah Burton, assistant to Charles Band. Despite his painful nature, I really wanted to see how it all went and so loved him a lot.
