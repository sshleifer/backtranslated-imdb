I like a movie that has at least the vestige of a story. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes without cohesion. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person picking up pineapple cans. A woman with a blonde wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the film and we never find out why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who cleans a man's apartment endlessly. There are countless scenes in a fast food restaurant where Mamas & Papas's "California Dreaming" is largely overplayed (I used to love the song). The dialogue focuses on food (pineapple, chef's salad and drink order). I guess most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this film because there is no story. It's supposedly a novel - it's not such a thing. I'm just wondering why I did not hit the Fast-forward. I was still waiting for something important ?? it's not. This is perhaps the only consolation of this film: the scenes have changed so quickly that it made you believe that there was going to be a revelation about all the nonsense.
