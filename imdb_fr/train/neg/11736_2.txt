The week before my visit to Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious student turns a film and can not decide if it wants it to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the movie he did. I can see much better movie elements in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to the artistic quality, both of these films had good character development and a consistent storyline. Iowa. This film stumbles to an absurd end. I must admit that it was consistent. This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part. The actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why does she have to demonstrate it in this ball game?
