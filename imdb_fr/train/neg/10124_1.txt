there is no suspense in this series! When an episode ends, the acting is so mediocre, the effects are so mediocre and the scenario is so horrible that the last thing that concerns you is how Batman and Robin will save the situation. No, in fact, the last thing that concerns you is to watch the next episode! This show is so boring that I do not see how it was made, let alone released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not up to contemporary Batman movies, but even the scenario is awful. An incoherent bazaar about a perverse professor and a ray gun or something, I'm not quite sure, because it's too horrible to follow. Look at the 60s or 90s version, or even Batman Begins, anything on this version!
