I recently bought the DVD forgetting how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line". Any changes made by the Attenborough director to the story fail. <br /> <br /> By making the relationship between the director and Cassie so important, the entire musical frame of the musical goes through the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers are accelerated and rushed. The hit song of the series sees all its broken meaning when it is given to the character of Cassie. <br /> <br /> The staging is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it a 2 is because some of the big numbers can still be appreciated despite the movie's attempt to extract all the joy and spontaneity.
