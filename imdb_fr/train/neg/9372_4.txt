It is a typical film of the late universal horror: its technique counts, even if one is based on the figures, with a plot of biscuit cutters and some serious overactivities. The most interesting part of this film is the stunt casting of Rondo Hatton, a man with bone disease, who is the "monster" of the film. It's sad to see this exploited man, but he probably used the money they paid him. Hatton is less horrifying than what the studio was hoping for, because I was more often pity on fear or even hatred. Martin Koslack is on board as a crazy artist of the film, and he is very entertaining in this part. For my part, I like to see Koslack in almost everything; for some reason, the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is its absurd interpretation of the art world. We are shown here critics of evil art who are crazy about their ability to break artists; it's next to the male "hero" of the movie who is an "artist" who paints ... get this ... pin girls. In one way or another, the work of our hero is examined side by side with the villan's absurd sculpture. The film's villainous critic also said that he despised the hero's pin-up art because "women like that do not exist", which our heroine responds with the assurance that the critic does not do not go out enough. Finally, there is a secondary plot about the domestication of heroin (which is itself an art critic) by the politician ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to testify. Overall, this movie is a rather mediocre picture with some fun elements.
