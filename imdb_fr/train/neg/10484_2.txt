Being a fan of Elvis, I do not understand how this project could be realized. It's by far the worst Elvis movie of all time, totally foolish, stupid and full of errors on The King. Come on, Elvis's grave in a public park? A mention of suspicious minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some actors in the cast try to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks's cameo is a surprise, but the guy who plays the young Elvis is bad. minute. If you want to see a very cheap, crazy, but absolutely funny little movie about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
