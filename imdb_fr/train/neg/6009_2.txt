What about Americans and their penchant with the gobbledy-gook religious? To think that this novel was a bestseller is incredible, but to make it a movie, you really need a good acting and a scenario that keeps its promises. In this case, all the good actors went to paradise and we find ourselves with Kirk Cameron, a CNN (!) Journalist, who tries to find out why many people have simply disappeared. Oh yes, there is a secondary plot about a diabolical world conspiracy and famine, or something like that. The good news is that it's done so cheaply, and with so insane a dialogue, that involuntary laughter has a disproportionate amount of entertainment. Not recommended for people with a 3-digit IQ.
