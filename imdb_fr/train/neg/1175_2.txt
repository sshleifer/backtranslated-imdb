Rohmer talked a lot about digital technology to "complete" the background. Sometimes it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid testify from far away from the king's execution is particularly striking. Other times, it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, which looks like a home video. However, the main drawback is that the artificial nature of the staging creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know that what we are looking at is not real so how can we feel for the characters? To be honest, I was totally mocking what had happened to the woman or the duke. <br /> <br /> The other big flaw, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. She is practically in all scenes and the success of the film is based on her performance. OK, she speaks a foreign language but she is unable to express real emotion. Her emotion in the scene where she tells her friend Ms. de Meyler (an excellent performance by debutante Helena Dubiel) that she saw her head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Look also at her hands when she expresses her emotions! <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is very disappointing, especially given the positive reviews that have been published on this site.
