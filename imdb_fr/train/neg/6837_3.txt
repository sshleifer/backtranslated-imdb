Normally, I do not like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot principle. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic locations (Hong Kong, for example), impressive gun battles and enough martial art to satisfy your desires for awesome hand-to-hand combat. Like all revenge movies, it contains villains that you would like to throw through the glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has nothing of the sensationalistic shit that stifles the plot and elitist, racist and venomous social stereotypes that have invaded "Eye for an eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> The Double Impact parcel department is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a team of gangs linked to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke with French accents is ugly. It was not the watery plot that made this film bad, but the use of clich√© lines and the passage of other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made the situation worse. Nevertheless, Double Impact is always watchable. But why do these shitty movies like this have bad guys (for example, that greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents and that deadly red-haired, lesbian girl) that you'd hate with the fiber of your being ?
