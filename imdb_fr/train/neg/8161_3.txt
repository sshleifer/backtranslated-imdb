Mary Lou is a slut whose mind seeks revenge for those who let her sink into her hell in 1957. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the strange trap 80s Stupid special effects, including a strange crazy rocking horse. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Lou's mind hurts people and tries to take control of a person's body. Whether it succeeds or not, you will have to look to find out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is largely boring and is based on a group of worthless characters. This is not a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the school. He has the avg. The horror film falls, gore, a useless nudity, strikes the Catholic Church. Basic stuff, boring movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
