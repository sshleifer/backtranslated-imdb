I read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I'm a big francophile and a big art lover, but I think it's another case where critics turn something "arty" or "intellectual" into something 'is not. I'll be honest: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has major psychological problems, but I really did not want to display them graphically. The film is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was pushed back by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it did not look like the kind of disgust and repulsion I felt during that movie .
