A compassionate cowboy of a neighboring Indian tribe is wrongly accused of the rape and murder of the chief's daughter, resulting in a great deal of hatred and violence. absolutely impossible to defend on any artistic level. The awful costumes and the fact that all Indians are obviously white make it look more like a real action comic than the serious production that his press documents claim to be. <br /> <br /> In short, abundant nudity (the real reason to look at it) is good. All the rest is not. There are certainly better examples of both genres. <br /> <br /> More interestingly, The Ramrodder was shot at the famous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in prison for murder at the moment that hit the stained soda screens of the Pussycat Theater!
