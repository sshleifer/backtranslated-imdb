It must be the most stupid movie I have ever seen (spoilers to come)! First, the plot is stupid. The boy is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the guardian. We find that the kid has a gift, the "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything except to give the impression that the child is cool. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man eventually gets crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because ... well, he feels like it. Why else would he? Suddenly, we see a naked woman in the bathtub. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a dead corpse, which is totally disgusting. One way or another, a black man enters the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then, the child and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies a few minutes after the hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but that falls well in this category. The music is trashy, the characters are nerdy (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of the vomit, the end is very predictable, the scenario is slow, tedious and boring. This film is extremely overestimated. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST. I'm surprised he scored so high on IMDb.
