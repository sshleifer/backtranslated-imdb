You have to watch this show once to have seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something in his own way, he hears but he upsets his wife. In the end, she discovers that what he did was really for her. She caresses her cheek and gives him a gummy smile as he looks modestly. In fact, the story is so lame and disguised that I will try my luck now. <br /> <br /> Episode "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jims's wife notices that all the weeklies of Jims the salary has disappeared, he then explains to him that he lost it at casino. She screams and leaves the house, lamenting how awful it is. Then on Valentine's Day, he presents himself in a limousine with tickets for a ball (thus explaining the missing salary). She realizes "her" mistake and the usual "oh Jim, you're so adorable". ..The end <br /> <br /> Another very obvious element is the fact that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson who, as a cartoon character, can afford to be warlike and ignorant. This attempt with humans not work and Jim just comes like an egocentric arrogant fool. <br /> <br /> The only reason it works is simply because we are so many in terms of human beings with TVs. These days, you could do a show about a man who insulates the walls and have an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men", on the other hand, is fantastic and hilarious.
