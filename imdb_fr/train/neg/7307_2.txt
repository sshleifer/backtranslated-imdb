It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in it are completely random and have little or no meaning. The fact that there is a sequel is so disgusting that I can catch a case of cabin fever (I AM SORRY). I describe it as a bug reported in a newspaper, because there seems to be different parts of things mixed up. For example, Kevin, the karate-loving pancake boy, is strangely weird, then the policeman is slightly bizarre and perverse, then the addict, then there's the fact that they're attacking a random guy who clearly needs to 'help. then, suddenly, the main character sleeps with his girlfriend simply because she says something stupid about the fall of a plane. then at the end, a good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating Kevin karate. It's actually pretty odious that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you like Eli Roth, although I did not like it. Hate is a strong word, but since it's the only word I'm allowed to use, it will have to do it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
