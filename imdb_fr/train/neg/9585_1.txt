I remember seeing this film in '86 when it came out and what a horrible movie. The acting was atrocious, the plot was so fragile that it should have or should have disappeared under a breath of wind. I think it made me sleep on more than one occasion and I was not tired that I can remember. Please, avoid at all costs better to always have all your teeth removed without any lug that would be more entertaining. It's just too bad that I can not give him a zero or a negative score. I wish I had not wasted my money buying this one in the video store. All I can say is that the tape on which it was was still new, which was hardly surprising as the film was so poor. If I remember correctly, I sat down and looked at it with a girl I really wanted to go out with and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake, but how bad this movie was
