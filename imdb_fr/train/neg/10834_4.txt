Sorry did I miss something? did I go out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and fake!) Stories made me think, "It's going to be a classic," but everything was down from there! The acting was great, because what it's worth, William H. Macy is fantastic and gets better and better every movie in which I watch it. But that never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big moment when all the stories come together and then suddenly ... it's raining frog ?? it was if the writer said, "I've got to the bottom of things, how can I intelligently gather all these stories ... Oh, shit, I'm going to have to rain frogs." I like smart movies, I like strange movies, but it was just strange and boring. 4/10
