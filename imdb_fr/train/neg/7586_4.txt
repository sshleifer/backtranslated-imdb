Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness, and rightly so, with the musical adaptation of Take Me Along on Broadway. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of Harry Warren-Ralph Blane's other songs are worth recalling, and even this one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It's right after the release of this movie that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do not think it's a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old and played Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was far too old for the 17-year-old who was influencing radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney shot four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy. a remake of A Crowd Rugit, the love of Robert Taylor, Andy Hardy and Words and Music. Rooney played an adult role at all. Even in the film Andy Hardy, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returning from the Second World War. Why he was in this situation, Louis B. Mayer only knows it. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad composition makes the summer holidays even harder, because in the original Ah Wilderness movie, the focus is on Walter Huston's father character. And in Broadway's Take Me Along, which won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One performed the intoxicated brother-in-law, Oncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan. This is the main character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven replaces Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and lovely girlfriend and Marilyn Maxwell stars as Rooney's adult education. In the original piece, O'Neill considers her a prostitute, but as was the case with the Hollywood code, all that Marilyn does is that the young Rooney is underestimated. <br /> <br /> A lot of really talented people have been there and they are doing their best, but the summer holidays are fading pretty quickly in the chilly autumn.
