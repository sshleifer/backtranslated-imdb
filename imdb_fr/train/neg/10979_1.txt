Words can not begin to describe how terrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad that it's good", but it's not. It's just dull, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only less charismatic person is director Brett Kelly, who, as a true statement about vanity, has presented himself as the leading male role. They both look like consuls, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The girl, Sherry Thurig, is a spectator. The opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willing, and can act. Although you can say that she is holding back. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the male support, Mark. I saw less wood in a rainforest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly stop his actors from acting? Is he really so bad a director? Everyone has perfectly summarized the story - there is not one. The children are kidnapped and Kelly enters the poop to solve the crime. I know how he felt when he got into the poo, that's how I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back in the rental store. This is a family film that is best shown by the director's friends (and if you look for them, you will see that those same friends are the ones who gave the film a positive rating).
