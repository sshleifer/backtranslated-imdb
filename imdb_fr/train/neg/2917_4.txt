As is often the case, the impressive and explosive movie trailers in Asia do nothing more than foolish stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story in which men are bred like ferocious wild dogs that execute the orders of their master. The main characters, an emotionally thirsty amoral killer who is compared to an equally unstable policeman, are far from the heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose the thread of what you are supposed to sympathize with, without feeling the slightest emotion for one or other of the men. If it's the director's failure or the underlining message he's trying to convey, it's up to you. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, At one point, it resulted in a trivial story of survival and revenge. The suspense that was evident at first soon disappeared due to a totally inadequate musical score that resulted in potentially effective narration. And in the end, you still felt that all the detailed basic information and introspection of the main characters were somehow useless. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the transition in history from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to American movies ?? Those who are not familiar with Asian movies and who are fed up with the predictability of Hollywood should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed blurry for most of the movie. It was like looking in an image taken with fluorescent lighting when it had to be tuned to tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it tired my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also enjoyed playing tricks ??? an interesting accumulation made me hope for a story that moves slowly until it is diverted to a low-speed, low-level pursuit scene. And just when you think you'll get an unanswered independent film with a mix of Shakespearian tragedy, you realize it's not an end, but rather a transition into a wacky montage of country music about peace and serenity. . > <br /> Embody terrible strangled scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery, and conversely, Asians' fascination with bodily fluids and horrible music that does not fit the film, and you get the bland Asian thriller way. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand why each fight scene was covered with clips of roaring lions? I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Finally, in the end, we are reminded of a real killer who is still hiding among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
