But let's face it ... it caused some nostalgic sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The show is so great that it's ok to have a few misses. I start a new season and I just go through as if I had 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​concluding, but it was rather an end-of-season episode that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox is not supposed to be bald for a few more episodes, The only explanation I can think of is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to redo the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, that's why the cox of hell is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is great ... bring on the 7th season.
