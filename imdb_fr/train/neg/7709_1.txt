Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> He's trying to be a parody of the 1950s and 1960s fiction / thriller films, but all he can do is really make you wish not to watch one. . <br /> <br /> He is very lame. A parody must have an aspect that has a superior quality. This film does not have this aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me but ... do not look at it.
