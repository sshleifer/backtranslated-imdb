Watching this stinker is a cruel and unusual punishment on Sandler's part. Really a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> 'Bought the DVD in the trash at $ 5.88 at Wal Mart. But the thought that resonates in my head is: "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgivable thing in the movie is that the boat JUST DO NOT PONCHER! <br /> Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know this show on the channel SciFi in which a guy and his machines to muppet distort the most unassailable horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, start a comedy show and present this movie. Without a good humorous parody of this train wreck, I fear that viewers will actually start following Sandler with ice picks and chain saws. <br /> <br />
