A very very bad movie, with some very good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> It starts with Linda Blair, a pregnant woman, running down the halls to escape monsters or ants, I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see that she is very pregnant. Its degree of pregnancy varies considerably throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and a boring and perhaps retarded little boy I thought was his son go to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! David Hasselhoff and his virgin German-speaking girlfriend are already on the island (you know the Germans are said to like Hasselhoff ...). He takes pictures and she translates an esoteric German book on witches, I think. <br /> <br /> Another couple who bought it, a real estate agent and a woman I thought I was going to the island was their daughter. She was clearly an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the children of the older couple. I guess they all traveled together on the island, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were separated from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel looks neat, certainly from the outside, but it is not used to great effects. An old woman badly dressed and wearing a black cloak continues to appear and sing something in German, which he eventually records on his tape recorder Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> People start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Although the copy I looked at indicates that it is uncut on the lid of the box, the death of a character whose veins have erupted really seems to have been cut off. Much of the scene shows the reactions of another character, because we do not see anything ourselves. The most frightening scene is one in which a man or a demon with a really messy mouth wound rapes someone. He looked particularly naughty. There is a ludicrous and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish that if a horror film were to turn her, they would do something original with her role and leave her exorcist behind her (except for the annual horror conventions). <br /> <br /> In the bizarre, mostly Italian, tradition of pretending to be a sequel to something unrelated to it, it's also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That's to say it would be a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - it's not as a better movie than this one). Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and far better than that). There is also a Casa 5, The (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to be a sequel to the fake series La Casa and the House: House series (1986), House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show. (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992). How is The Horror Show? This is not really, he claimed to be a sequel, thus forcing the entry of the real series to be renumbered to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Strangely, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and The Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. You have a headache?
