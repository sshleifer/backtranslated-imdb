Cinematographic version necessarily ridiculous of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival of Mrs. Bennett's affections. When Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects it. He must kill the whale and win back Bennett ... <br /> <br /> Several scenes have perhaps delighted the public of 1930; especially the scenes where Barrymore loses his leg. The film, however, did not age well; there are much better movies of the time, both in the 1920s silence and in the 1930s movies. Both attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (14/08/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
