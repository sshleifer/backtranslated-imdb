The title and description of Big Rig interested me when I attended the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas. However, I was eager to get rid of the seats at the end of Big Rig. Big Rig is made up of several "big drivers" whose goal is to deliver goods across the United States. The characters are all great people, but the filmmakers have never immersed themselves in their complexity. Instead, the story snakes as much as the movie cards are supposed to guide, but never do. At most, we lose ourselves. We - the public - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the story, we arrive somewhere but without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we come here? The narrative is sloppy and the filmmakers' intention to "humanize" a group of people they regard as "neglected" and "invisible" seems to condescend unconsciously and with irritation. The problem here is the perspective of the directors rather than the drivers. The filmmakers present their own naive assumptions about the truckers, then simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. Overall, the story lacks tension, the film is too long (it should have been a 15-minute sketch), the big question of "So what" is never solved, and the whole movie is a transparent piece of propaganda that says nothing to "enlighten" (as the administrators claim) the outside world about big riggers.
