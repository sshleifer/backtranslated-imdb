1st watched on 28/2/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - The DVD version I watched titled "3 Days of the Condor" - The So So drama of the CIA abounds with casual movie performances. The premise of the story is that seven members of a CIA research group were murdered with the character Robert Redford, codename = Condor, being the one who was left behind. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to discover while trying not to be the 8th victim at the same time. En route, the character of Faye Dunaway is involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, then she finally helps him after a little period of love. This is one of the few stories of innocent men on the run, but this one does not have much suspense. Flat performances are useless and the finish does not seal the offer enough for the public. Despite a good director at Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the performances are not what they should be and, therefore, the film is not what it should be.
