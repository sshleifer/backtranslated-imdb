Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever saw was "42nd Street". I was expecting all his things to be so good. I discovered that this was not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite actor of the classical era, James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the music numbers in the end are still spectacular, but the story is like many others and quite tiring. They seem to always involve producers of screaming and unhappy shows. In this film, Cagney ends up screaming things so often that he gives me a headache after a while and his character runs out ... quickly! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are close to "42nd Street", songs that you could hum for years and decades, I should say, the songs in this movie are not memorable. it's one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley - I do not like it at all and was very disappointed to watch.
