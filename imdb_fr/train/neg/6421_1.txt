I am amazed by some of the critics of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is awful. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not scary either. People who think it's because Sarah Michelle Geller is a star that The Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slow as it moves. I was extremely disappointed by this movie. It did not scare me and did not interest me either. Let's face it, this type of plot has been flogged to death at this point, for example. the dead trying to contact the living - dragonfly, what lies behind, ghost story, dark water, darkness, the Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the Japanese and Koreans are the only ones to write original horror films. Movies coming out of Hollywood, like this one, are cynical exercises of making money without any respect for the viewer. They are just being released
