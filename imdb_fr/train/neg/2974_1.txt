I am a nice guy and I like to think of myself as tolerant to the genre. And, I guess by that, I mean that I try to consider a film in the context of the genre in which it resides. do not like doing it. <br /> <br /> The plot of it was obviously obvious, the value of the production was very low and fixed, uh, simplistic. The game of actors has become from time to time a territory "good for high school play". My feeling was that it was filmed in one day - tell me that was the case. <br /> <br /> Worse, sex, though reasonably abundant, was quite banal, hindered, at least in my copy, by a "sound-over" that was incompatible with the action (moans and cries). cries climbed lying on a bed undoing a bra ???). There was absolutely no "benefit" - nothing special or interesting, and with surprisingly fast cuts. <br /> <br /> My vote is a "1", with the following summary statement: better if the filling material of the club was expanded and the rest of the film condensed.
