This film shows an extract of mutilation of a living animal, hacked by a machete and torn by the skin. I know that these horrible things happen in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I'm watching does not actually happen on the screen. These live animal clips are not supposed to feature in the movies. They are meant to show people in certain organizations the right to help humans do horrible things. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate to bring this film out of the market! <br /> <br /> This film should be removed from the public. The person who made this film needs psychological help.
