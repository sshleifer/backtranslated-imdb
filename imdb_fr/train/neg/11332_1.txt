As big as a Texas meadow and just as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not float this overworked boat. In fact, Taylor looks bad - bad wardrobe, bad hair and bad makeup - a unique achievement in his remarkable career. Hopper gives the only credible representation, and Dean in the climactic scene shows a remarkable talent as a character for whom we do not usually remember: a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and one wonders what Redford could have done with the main male role. There is no discernable intrigue that offers tension until the last twenty minutes, there is only one pastiche of milestones that have little relation to each other. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character development, but only a collection of cardboard cutouts that appear periodically for no perceptible reason, such as random targets in a firing shop. This film has the merit of tackling racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects. Plus, it has size, making it a great choice to get rid of unwanted guests from home. Those who own the DVD version can save themselves some of the trouble by starting with the second disc. You will not miss anything.
