I tried to get through this bomb not so long ago. What a disaster. The acting was atrocious.There were absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat like a lead balloon.This was mainly due to the fact that the reactions seem to be a modern retouch of the original "Lifeboat From Hitchcock I think Hictcock would circle his grave at the thought of it. From what I have been able to undergo, there is nothing convincing in this movie.it counts some semi-big names, but they make no effort for their characters. But to be honest, it was nobody's fault. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script exploded in the first explosion. . LOL.It's possible that this thing will eventually improve over time.But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out.So unless you have at least one week- end of three days on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
