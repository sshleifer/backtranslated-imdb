> you are warned that it is a spoiler! > This film is so bad that I doubt to be able to write enough lines. good direction shots were well thought out. the actors were very good especially Richard Pryor although I would have liked to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley More god bless him could have done better. John Ritter again I would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is due entirely to the failure of the writer. Perhaps the producer could have unplugged once he saw what he was creating. It's just too bad that so much money has been invested in this boiler, so with a little change here and there, in my opinion, it would be fixed. They had to pay the standard rates of the authors. Make a little laugh.
