This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this film. Taking the bus while apparently anti-racist only blames whites and degrades the black status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men who go on a bus to the march of a million men of Louis Farrakhan. The bus has all types of people you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and Uncle Tom (he is thrown off the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist as soon as he got on the bus to drive. Although he is Jewish and explains his situation, he ends up being racist and leaves the bus. I hate to say it, but films like this one require to realize their own hipocracy and non-reinforcement sterotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad disappointment. You may think that I am racist for writing this, but I mean well. Best luck next time Spike.
