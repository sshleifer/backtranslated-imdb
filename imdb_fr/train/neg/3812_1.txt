Full House is one of the worst TV series of all time! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear them. The best character is Joey and even he's pretty irritating on occasion. A DJ of this girl, who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time she speaks. Not to mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ has won about ten thousand dollars or more at the casino.However, she is not eighteen, so she must not play according to the law. ready to pay him the money, but then Danny, her father, took care of her and did not let her raise that money because she was not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, will you? Since I saw this silly and puerile scene, I instantly turned off the television. Some say what they say in this series that no child would want to buy. Who in the world would think that Full House is fun and fun? Every word they say in this series seems to be like Shakespeare wrote except that Shakespere knew how to write and that he would not be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the Full House script! <br /> <br /> For all those who have a broken heart, a serious illness, a will to live or a feeling of the real world, I urge them not to look at the clean room! Avoid this series. Spare yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show of all time! I prefer to watch Teletubbies than this one. Do not look at that.
