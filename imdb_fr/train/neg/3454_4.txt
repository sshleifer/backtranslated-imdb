Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers, a parody of the horror genre that has tried to be smart by referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I do not do Scream, I think "Scream" is a very good horror movie that does a great job mixing horror and comedy. Cut fails on most levels. It has its moments, but all in all, it just does not work, not even as a movie "so bad it's good" but just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are correct and set the story pretty well, aside from the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically she pulls out the tongue, go understand. Go ahead a bit and a group of film students wants to finish his film, which is apparently cursed. And, as you probably would have expected, one by one, a masked madman, slowly mingles with the troop and the team. <br /> <br /> A new plot, a mediocre staging and a predictable end are some of the elements that follow. There are many references in the movie, from "Scream" to "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". It's not clever either, it's as if the director wanted to feel clever and cool by evoking other famous horror movies like Scream. For a slasher, there is a minimum of gore and no nudity, which is a huge disadvantage when it comes to a slasher that does not have much success. Really, I should support this movie because I'm Australian and we're not as good at horror (we still have our jewels), but Cut is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it kept me watching for about 90 minutes, so it's something good at least. I would not recommend it to anyone other than hardcore slasher fans who might understand the purpose of this movie, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
