This bomb is just an "explosion" after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of his strengths. I give it a 1 in 10. I would have made a zero but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I'm back again before this joke Tim Burton about Mars. Nicholson had the courage to admit it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, then this movie is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money." You can bet I would do it if I could. But this is the problem of premium services, the variety of subscriptions.
