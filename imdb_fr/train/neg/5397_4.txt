I think it's one of Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian's weakest works. After such great efforts as much noise for nothing, etc., I thought it was mediocre. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but the biggest complaint I would make is that they messed up Bard's work and cut off part of the piece to put it in stage / dance. <br /> <br /> You do not do Shakespeare and do not play with the play. Sorry, but it's just wrong. I like some Cole Porter, just like the next person, but damn it, do not mess with Shakespeare. Ignore this and look at "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearian adaptation of the Tempest.
