I thought I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but this movie is in competition with him. <br /> <br /> I am not a person who falls asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the beginning of the trance. I woke up and started looking at him for a year. Why did I deserve this? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast forward to watch it all. <br /> <br /> I can not stand why one of my favorite actors of all time (Mr WALKEN) could do that. I must think that he did a favor to the director or that he really needed money, because film after film, he ruins himself. and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? it's not scary, a stupid plot, the characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), the effects are very mediocre, the lack of deaths and blood, etc. in three words, he has anything. And I really think so. You can not stand how a director can make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was even more disappointed, it was when I saw in the cover of the video that the film was presented by "Stephen King". think he could never present that shit, right? (I rented it in Argentina) I do not recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my review of "The Return of the Chainsaw Massacre", there will always be worse movies, which is why it does not deserve not a 1 of 10)
