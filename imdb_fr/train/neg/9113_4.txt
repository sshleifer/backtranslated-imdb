They had such potential for this film and they fall completely flat. In the first cruel intentions, we wonder what motivated the main characters to become what they are and to act as they do. There is virtually NO character development in this pre-sequence. It's actually a very sad story but this movie brought me nothing. It was as if they were leaving aside good writing instead of useless words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and explains nothing. The writing was just terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at least 3 EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as "down boy", or the kissing scene, and some others I can not remember. Robin's acting did not impress me at all, but Amy did a great job. That's pretty much the only thing that reconciled this movie.
