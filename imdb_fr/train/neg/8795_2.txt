I have seen virtually no redemptive quality in this film. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly crazy obsession with her ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe it's a decent quality. But overall, I found this film surreal and ridiculous. The making of movies by hand, associated with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks, I found clumsy and dizzying, even disgusting. All in all, the music was horrible and repetitive to the extreme, reminding me of the American army's psychological warfare against various dissatisfied people. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes that make up the film are random in their placement and lack of satisfaction. unsolved in their content and "conclusions". A depressing film (not a real movie, a term I reserve for real art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the different people trying to make this a "romantic comedy", even if some isolated elements of this film are repudiated as to the content, form and conclusion of any association with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest staying away despite seemingly dominant views on IMDb and other ranking sources.
