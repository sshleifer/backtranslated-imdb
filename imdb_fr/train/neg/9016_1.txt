Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel movie (although I suppose it's now called Syfy?), The original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two since, and I can tell you they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is badly done, the acting is bad, the scenario is ridiculous, and what happens at the end is unexpected and inappropriate (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I'm talking about, I did not want not put a spoiler in my opinion). Plus, there was this musical melody that was used pretty much in every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid. they just played again and again. And it is certainly not original. I know I've heard that somewhere before (I just do not remember where). This is to be avoided.
