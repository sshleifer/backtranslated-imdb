Yes, I rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent place portrays a rather embarrassing story, without a real reward, but at least it pulls well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases, this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker is going off pretty quickly. Cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing are simply terrible. The slowest scenes drag on and the alarms are too rare, without any real highlight for the film. A mysterious mood prevails in the beginning, but loses its brilliance before any horror and I found myself bored at the idea of ​​making another sandwich ... The cover is attractive and I guess it's worth renting for a shipwreck Stupid budget, but if you like a good story and an eventful end, try something else.
