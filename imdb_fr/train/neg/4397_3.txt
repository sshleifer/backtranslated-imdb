One of my friends lent me this game and it is too hard! It looks like a children's game, but you have to learn how to make tons of complex movements that require you to twist and turn your hands in all kinds of challenging positions, and you have to look for seemingly endless levels to 100 improve your "score"! You must also find these incredibly hidden puzzle pieces, which force you to perform almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO SCENE THREE !!!!! Maybe if you do not have a life, you can stay home all the time and enjoy it, but stay away! AND IT IS NOT DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - THEY WILL TAKE THEIR HAIR IN AN HOUR!
