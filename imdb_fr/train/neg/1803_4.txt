Here is one of these educational short films made to teach strangers the realities of life. This time, the target audience is non-adolescent girls, living is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with the sponsorship of Kotex. <br /> <br /> He begins by explaining how hormones help you grow and develop. With the help of the animation and a narrator, he shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, works and why all this leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing to become here the comic note, how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned although "furtilized" will pass once. I do not really know why I saw this, but since it's one of those rare shorts that might seem like an innocent time, you might want to try it.
