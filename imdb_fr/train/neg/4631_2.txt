Although Misty Ayers (the burlesque stripper) certainly seduces in blond, this film is only an excuse to let her undress several times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was shot, not 1965). <Br /> <br /> The guy who hires him to work in a brothel is like Abbott's Bud Abbott & Costello. Most other women are unattractive, and the drunk woman is half amusing in a scary way. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvaceous physique, but you can not judge any. acting talent because the entire movie is post-dubbed. Some of these "exploitation films", generally subsequent to this one, are interesting in a way, but it's really a boring party. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed. There are samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there is really nothing here.
