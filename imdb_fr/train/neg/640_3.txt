Chilly, an alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an army captain returning from duty in World War II with weakened memory (an original idea! He seems to remember the old flame Glenda Jackson but of his current wife Julie Christie, who should be enough to trigger emotional sparks.This film extremely well assembled combines the famous Alan Bates, the director Alan Bridges, and the co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are at their lowest, there are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but the pace of Bridges is incredibly slow and the dull color of the movie is annoying. , it is better to leave this "soldier" forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
