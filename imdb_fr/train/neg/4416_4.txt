A less than subtle brushstroke against the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church takes a darker shade of death towards the end of the show. Throughout the series, black humor plays a media role through which several common rhetorical questions are posed, including "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" <br /> Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some may disagree) of their stereotypical religious teacher who springs from the "company line" and condemns half of the world to burn in hell . To celebrate her 25th birthday, she invites her first students to come back and play their Christmas show. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updates" her piece to parody Sister Mary's "fallacious" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, throwing the story spiraling in a chain of unfortunate events. The end finally leaves the audience with a feeling of unease in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go watch the game instead.
