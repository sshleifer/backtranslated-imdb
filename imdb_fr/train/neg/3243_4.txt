By far, the most important requirement for any scammers' movie is that they must, at least from time to time, be able to take one from us, as well as their stupid marks, the cops, the crowd and (ideally) the each other. . But this film NEVER succeeds. Each scam can be seen one kilometer away (especially the biggest!). They are also not very interesting, complex or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this by a serene dialogue and complex psychological relations. If so, he failed. The lines are correct, but they are stylized, artificial, and artificial, which made me think that maybe we had a clever idea that we all act all the time ... but that's not the case. was not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a little repressed and Freudian slips ridiculously forced on her father, thinking that she is a whore, but she is recovering. I really liked the street scenes though. Looked like an Edward Hopper painting.
