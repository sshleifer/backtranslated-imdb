Why does every film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh, bring out the worst of making a movie? Whatever the attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to appear on the screen as anything other than the antics of high school students too sexed. Despite sumptuous sets and costumes, this film is as bad as any "extravagance" of the Italian "sandals and toga" of the 50s. Certainly, this kind of spectacular belongs to the big screen, which is why "Gladiator" has well-marketed, but "Gladiator" does not have any romance sex love. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela also has little talent as an actress like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Too bad some did not wash others.
