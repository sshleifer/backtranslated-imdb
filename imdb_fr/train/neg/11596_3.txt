"The Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the "Nightmare" series (usually overestimated) and, at the latest from that moment, the series became the trash. The only good movies in the series are Wes Craven's 1984 original, and 1987's The Dream Warriors, the third part. The second part was disappointing and boring, and that was the fourth part in which the Crazy crazy, Freddy Krueger bored with constant silly jokes. This fifth entry in the series has almost nothing to recommend, apart from the visuals (certainly brilliant) and a scary scene, a flashback sequence on the creation of Freddy Krueger. The rest of the film is mostly about our shaved maniacs, screaming stupid puppets, and the old formula of a group of teenagers trying desperately not to fall asleep, because the good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a lot of crap without interest, like a supernatural "silly" nursery rhyme, is added for nothing more than to have some justification to make this superfluous and boring sequel . .. In short: No originality, just a decline from the old formula and an overload of painfully boring jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great graphics, and especially to emphasize the difference with the terrible sequel, "Freddy's Dead", which is awful. If you are not a fan of Freddy Krueger, avoid "The Dream Child", and even if you are, it may disappoint you.
