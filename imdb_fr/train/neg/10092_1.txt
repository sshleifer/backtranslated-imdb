Really bad movie. <br /> <br /> First, the film begins with a policeman and his partner parked in front of a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl to the warehouse attic, while the novice cop sits outside and thinks about what might happen up there. The "bad" policeman finally comes back with a heavy gym bag, and the novice policeman does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what's in the bag. is OK (for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a breaststroke (slightly improved). But eventually, people start to understand, which took a while considering how obvious it was. A girl receives a voodoo spell in case she dies, like you. Now, the "bad" policeman ends up killing that magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the bagged body. a lot of eyeshadow on it, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie ... moreover, the magic spell makes all the other girls become "fictional monsters". Some of the girls meet a guy who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they seem normal). But when girls see other people, like the husband of one of them, he panics because it is hideous (some people panic, but others do not notice) ... There is a huge plot. <br /> <br /> Thus, to conclude, the ghost monsters kill the "bad" cop, who ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for a sequel! Like anyone would like to see part 2 of this cow falling.
