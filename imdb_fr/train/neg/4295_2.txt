This is yet another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very smoothly and predictably and continues throughout the film. I was waiting for it to be picked up, but unfortunately it never happened. The acting game is right, but the scenario requires a LOT of work. And if you are looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these actors not very hot. Due to the poor sound quality and lack of legends, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gay movies, or if you've recently agreed to be gay, you might find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your low-budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
