In a way, it's the disaster that Fellini has worked all his life. The dividing line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and the category in which a film will fit will often depend on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" left me in a cold admiration for his sets and a little more than Bukowski can summarize more adequately: <br /> <br /> "Casanova is dead too, just an old man with a big dick and a long tongue and no courage at all, to say that he has lived well is true, to say that I could spit on his grave without feeling is as true, the ladies usually go for the biggest idiot they can find This is why the human race stands where we are today: we have created intelligent and sustainable Casanovas, all hollow inside, like Easter bunnies that we raise in our poor children. " /> <br /> As far as I know, this is Fellini's position regarding his subject; granted, with more empathy, but disgusting nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made up of rotting and incestuous behavior, themes that Fellini treated more precisely in "Satyricon". The succession of intrigues is characteristic of the soft pornography, but without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of being forgotten. <br /> <br /> Still, it might be useful to portray Casanova as an ugly idiot. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, he looks like a dirty old man - a maestro, of course, but whose impulses are more satisfying than anyone else. I find it difficult to imagine an audience that loves this film. It was a story that was not worth telling.
