This film begins with a certain promise; but, in my opinion, begins to lose it when the protagonist removes the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. It is quite unlikely that this well-meaning foreigner is starting to repair her car in her absence, but she is one of the few people in the country who can help her put her family life back on track. Coincidentally novice writers are warned against use in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this medium film at best. The art direction could have been much better, just like the cinematography. The acting was good, as was Eva van der Gucht's singing.
