Blasphemy, stupidity, complacency towards oneself and the bad act of actors unite for a real tour de force in a terrible film. Pesci's attempt to prove that my cousin Vinny was not a coincidence, shows the opposite. He is usually too light and his mouth impolite to handle the lead. A real must-miss!
