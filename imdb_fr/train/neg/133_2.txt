Well, the reason for seeing him at the movies was that it was a taste, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teen movie. I mean, do not we have enough? Scream and Scary Movie, at least, did not take them seriously! The plot is nil, and the acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that rivals being the worst I've seen in cinema with this one.) <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the plot in history, and the girls are so alike that we do not even know who was killed or who killed him. (and you do not care.) The only one I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the least talented actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
