Because others have taken the trouble to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this movie. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to filter them. <br /> <br /> - Given the low budget of the film, the creature's drawing was pretty good. In fact, it's nice to see a horror movie live on video that is not covered with horrible computer graphics. Unfortunately, the quality of the digital film is rather grainy in places, and it is particularly noticeable in the well-lit white rooms of the asylum. <br /> <br /> - The design of the lighting is ridiculous in some parts of this film, not to mention the variations of the passage of time. I understand that the director may have tried to simulate dementia, but for this to be effective, a consistent and consistent flow of time was needed. As it stands, it just seems amateurish. <br /> <br /> - The twists of the plot were numerous but still predictable. I had no doubt about my identity as to the identity of the cultists in costume, nor about the fact that a mediocre lame-evil-good development would finally appear. <br /> <br /> - It may seem quibble, but the characters in this movie are reliably lacking any common sense. First, the regulatory boards would be divided into a mental health center that unilaterally declared all deaths of patients and employees caused by cardiac arrest. Why would the Chief Psychiatrist also be able to perform autopsies? Why did not we make a plot of land from these awesome qualifications, or from his introduction to his strange choice of religion? What is the background? What is supposed to take care of someone in this? And just as importantly, which in the minds of these would go through the introduction to the place, would see everything that was so terribly wrong, and then conclude that it was still a good place to pursue a residence? This film did not even sufficiently respect his characters to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: see the wicker man instead.
