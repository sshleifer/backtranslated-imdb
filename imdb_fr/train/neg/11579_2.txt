I must admit that I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure if there is one. I was so irritated by this movie that I had a little trouble concentrating on it. How can you name a film "Keys to Tulsa" then film it in Texas? The desert and flat area around Arlington (I think it's its location) is nothing like the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much livelier neighborhood. Obviously, no one in the film has ever been so much Tulsa or they would have realized how nothing in the movie was like him. Had not we at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know it sounds difficult, but I can not help it. I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not animate these meanders and tell the story of people involved who are NOT IN TULSA !! I'm sorry, it can not be more expensive to shoot in Oklahoma. What if "live and die in Los Angeles" was shot in Toronto? Is it afraid? Well, that's it.
