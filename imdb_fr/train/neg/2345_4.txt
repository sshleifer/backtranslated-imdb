I watched Written on The Wind with Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone. Robert Stack was horrible - just awful - he was supposed to be a charming millionaire by air - instead, he came out like an idiot go-the plot was stupid and overworked and the 3 "romantic" sons did not had no chemistry. In a way, Dorothy Malone won the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role - although her country character is boring - thinks that Splendor's older sister in The Grass was full of mischief and bitterness and lacked charisma . The director, Douglas Sirk, surprised everyone involved in the dialogue in a forced dialogue. The end result was a loss of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor who played the leader on Get Smart
