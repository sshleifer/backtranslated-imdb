** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Naked topless heroine rescues another beautiful girl and her father (an eccentric teacher whose helmet is torn in one blow and whole in another) d A nasty eaten, a mummy and Nazi villains ready for - what else? - build a fourth Reich. Misty's costume, like that of other wimmen, becomes thinner as the film progresses. The last part of the film is devoted to prolonged lesbian action. this sequence becomes really boring, very fast, which says more about the creatures behind the camera than the creatures with the generous curves that are in front of her. MISTY quickly and quickly recovers his nominal plot, then gives unwavering attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to 1960s movies by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this wonder had been launched four decades ago, it would have played for years at 42nd Street alongside WHAM BAM, MERCI SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it stands, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER has gone straight to home video. Take yours, quickly, before it runs out.
