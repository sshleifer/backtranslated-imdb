... although for a film that seems to want to present itself as a horror, there was a flagrant lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a flagrant lack of talent for directing, editing, editing and scriptwriting. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London has presented one of the most dreadful performances I have ever seen: his "descent into the maelstrom" of madness is painfully self-conscious and awkward. Oh watch him contract! Oh, watch him drink strong spirits! Oh, look at him, raising his eyebrows and bending his head at an insignificant angle! Oh look at her unwashed, greasy black hair! Oh, listen to her hoarse voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, take out the shirt-poet - it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe) Oh, for the sake of ... did anyone give this guy a "How To Act Good" manual or just get him out of his box? on the other hand, the late small price of plastic toys abandoned cheap cereal brand. Ok, that's a stupid line - but that's only because London's performance has melted my brain and its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute and she is very briar pink, but she has not grown up in her shoes yet in this movie - she delivered her replicas as if she were restrained, in fact, all her performance was very wooden, her poses as stiff as her replicas - who knows, maybe she had just reacted and tried to neutralize the excitement of Jeremy London excess, but if so, she takes too far. <br /> <br /> Arie Verveen is remarkable as a Poe - although the role of his character is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. He just looks ok, but it's more than that - he has a kind of depth, I thought he had a life beyond the mediocre two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Um, maybe it's just because I like Poe so I can let my mind wander and invent while he's on screen - whatever, he had a factor of interest that he misses . <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a blur without a face - there are all the usual caricatures: the bright-haired best friend who is a little floozy; the local cop hit who is a little idiotic; the old protective man who perhaps has a too paternal interest for our heroine; the old intriguing witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the problem of the "gross lack of blood for a horror film", none of the themes they mention (and that the character of London evokes - so scathing - in his attack on Poe's writing) is followed on. As another commentator put it - there was a potential here: murder, incest - really shocking, but instead they moved away from problems, and violence (a raised candlestick swinging the air - closer to his victim - This is very much in a traditional Blackish horror, indeed, it is expected, and is warmly welcomed when this happens - it is an expensive convention, especially when accompanied by false lightning and An intense make-up for the Siouxie eyes - but in 'Descendant, it just looks awkward, or as if the editor had a heart ache at the last minute and suppressed it.) It could have been a very intense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis / delirium / madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher movie: it tries to be both, neither (something new and exciting!), but of any way he fails miserably. The only element of horror of this film is its epic dullness. <br /> <br /> I think that the publisher (if any) must have been drunk when he cut this story - there are poorly hung up scenes; scenes that seemed to be down (but that could have been the wrong script). Similarly, the director and director of photography - there were some very strange shots and frames that I think were supposed to be homages to Hitchcock or Browning, but that ended up being ridiculous (again, very well in the dark, but that meant something else.) <br /> <br /> All this may have been funny (in the same way that previous critics have mentioned it - "OMG, how did that Was it made?!? ") if I was in the mood for trashbag, unfortunately for me, I settled on the couch, dimmed lights, with the express intention of scaring me, it's a very bad film, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to anyone, not even to laugh. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money, borrow a real horror / thriller movie, or find yourself a copy of Poe's fantastic stories. We will have a much more pleasant and scary night than you might expect with this garbage.
