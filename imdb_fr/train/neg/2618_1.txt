... because it was just awful. 101 Dalamatians was funny, even if it was a formula, but it's nothing more than a childish joke. The same plot except with the excised narrative; the most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw in the world; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can not do comedy (everyone remembers Percy at Blackadder but that was his forte - everything has been downhill ever since); direction so poor that if a group of students had done it, throw it in the trash and tell them to do it again - right this time. Ieuan Grufford would do better to return to Hornblower sharpish, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should hide for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I could be too harsh; After all, I did not manage to pass the whole movie. He gets 1/10; only because I can not give it 0.
