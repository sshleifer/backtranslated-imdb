This film is horrible. Decent combat scenes or not, the acting game is REALLY bad, as you can see, they read their lines from a map. With painful lines delivered by all actors. Remember to watch a play in high school and realize the obvious lack of finesse in the actor's interactions (strange breaks between lines of different characters, combined with fast delivery of lines by others). If the film was all action, it might be forgivable, but much of the film includes the staging and style Family Guy, irreverent cuts (Oh, wow, they are badly made). I guess they were trying to be funny with that, but again it turned out to be a bunch of high school students starting out in the afternoon trying to put together a Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to fight scenes. They are not so bad, given the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. Nothing extraordinary either, certainly not of the same level as the other posters (nothing comparable to Drunken Master). The fights have an excessive staging feeling, with LOTS of cuts at different angles with totally different positions from the people involved. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the friends of the guy involved in this very, very cheap production. What guy can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and watched in this college masterpiece.
