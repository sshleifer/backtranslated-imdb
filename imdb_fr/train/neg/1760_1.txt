This film makes several mistakes. some American actors in Spain and Spanish actors speaking English. the English of "Spaniards" is correct, but the way of acting is very annoying. the dialogue throughout the script is very weak; it may have been a Spanish script, but translated incorrectly, who knows and who is interested. I can only assume that they are famous Spanish actors forced to speak English, they can be good, but not in this flop. you will discover the film in the first 5 minutes, it's so pathetic. so the rest is just bad. a lot of waste of time, a lot of parcels needed at the UN. Oh, did I mention one of Baldwin?
