The autobiography of the founder of the New York Zoo begins with being very cute and would be a family film if she stayed there. However, we are more and more involved in reality as the gorilla becomes a wild thing that does not easily lend itself to the wishes of its "mother" - this could scare younger children, in particular. scenes where Buddy tries to hurt Gertrude. quite fast resolution at the end. below average.
