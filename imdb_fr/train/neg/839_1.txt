The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least, all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time passed through this bomb. The crew member responsible for continuity missed the boat. When the female leader and the FBI man went to the scene of the alleged killers, Mr. FBI gave the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out, the revolver magically turned into an automatic. All that remains is to ask whether a PBF agent would hand over a weapon to a civilian? I do not think so. Ms. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is unfortunate that the grade R did not allow many of her to be seen. It looks like a movie publisher has removed what might have been the best parts of the movie.
