This film does not really encourage kids to be kinder and have better attitudes, like a family film, and that would not be considered a family because it contains elements that children should not see. Not the best ABC Family movie if you ask me. If there were fewer sexual themes in the film, then it might be better. Hollywood does nothing to improve a movie by adding sexual situations. There is really no reason for them. At least it's a TV movie. I would not want to waste my money on this waste by renting it. If you have anything to do but watch this movie, please go there.
