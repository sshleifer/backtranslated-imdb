This movie was not made by Who's fans. Most of the highlights that fans are eagerly awaiting in Tommy Medley's half-hour are simply missed or passed over: at Christmas, they did not show Daltry's cries after the line "Tommy does not know what day we are ... ", they showed almost no Townsend guitar strokes in Pinball Wizard, there was excessive crowd beating during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We will not take it. to you), they stole almost every shot from Pete's flamboyant guitar chords. Huge pieces of the film are shot in the back of the group. It is a very frustrating film to watch and that does not deliver the goods. I do not know if director Murry Lerner is just not a fan of Who, or worse, for him at least, if he's * a * fan of Who and all * eight * cameras could be helpful. To his credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as favorites, which are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. That might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you do not anticipate Tommy. The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; it can be different on video or DVD.
