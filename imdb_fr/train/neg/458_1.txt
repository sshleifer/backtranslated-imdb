What is this shit? My little cousin obviously chose for the title and the title of the DVD, a girl too feminine ... I decided to look at it with her so that she does not get bored and I am really dismayed by the quality horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the acting game was terrible. They look like amateur actresses reading memory cards. Delivery is below normal and very stereotyped. The scenes were terribly cut ... it looks like they were taken directly from the screenplay, if any. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or well played at all, again, very formulaic. I can not count the number of times I've been able to predict the next joke. I had some small laughs of these glaring "subtle" sexual insinuations. The cat, the castor patch, Hung Wong? .. come on! Stay ... far from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a PG children's movie with useless sexual insinuations, vulgarity and violence to increase the rating of the MPAA. STAY AWAY <br /> <br /> "Do you want to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is this what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> "You could get on my ding." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I have blood on my stool!" <br /> <br /> Badly played, sir.
