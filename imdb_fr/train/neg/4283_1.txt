Unfortunately it's true. "Legiunea sträinä" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of the irreversible failure of Daneliuc. <br /> <br /> As has already been said, the author has lost the ability to merge his content factors and his artistic intentions into a coherent form. Manely mindful of the mechanical trick of randomly picking up hot topics and reuniting them with no legitimacy, he only gathers a messy heap of events, unable to follow the slightest story. The level of the scenario is similar to that of an amateur play "Cântarea României" on the glorious prowess of socialist realism - only upset: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sweet festivism, Daneliuc is now also obsessed with perniciousness. Negativism and disgusting scatology. The content of the ideas is nil and the "message" infantile and didactic at the kindergarten level. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has also forgotten the most basic professional principles. It is no longer able to organize a dramatic situation, to classify it in a correct movie scene, to frame it correctly and to retouch it by following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of narration in film footage is similar to that of phrasing like, "Good God, it's not crazy, and all people are donkeys!" What a huge distance with the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works like "Cursa", "Proba de microfon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit Gloria Mundi ...
