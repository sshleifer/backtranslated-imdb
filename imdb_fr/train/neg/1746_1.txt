Probably the worst Bollywood movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> No plot. Very few character developments. <br /> <br /> Full of silly and useless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and without direction. There was no appropriate end to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping center. <br /> <br /> Same story told again and again until you want to say "please, move on something else !!" Even the song and the dance were useless and badly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bodies everywhere ... but most Bollywood movies have it anyway nowadays. <br /> <br /> Btw I am not of Indian origin <br /> <br /> 2/10
