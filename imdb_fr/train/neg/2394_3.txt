This film was strange ... I watched it ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you're supposed to look up, but mushrooms are not enough. I could not help but laugh ... maybe Lds would work. The film is a lot of things that turn into other things and dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards, but when it came out, I'm sure it was good ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I did not think it was very interesting, and I was mushroom at the time. If you have a party or something and everyone is well enlightened, make it burst, you'll have some laughter.
