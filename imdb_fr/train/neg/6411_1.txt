The Return is one of those movies for this niche group that loves movies that annoy and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame businesswoman who does not kill vampires and does not undress at all throughout the film. I was willing to endure this, but I was not willing to endure the worst editing ever combined with unnecessary flashbacks. In the end, it seems to her that her car crashed when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a flashback. With this film, it's impossible to say. Can you believe the same guy who made the army of darkness produces this shit? A much better idea is to stay home and watch Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. This movie had it all: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw as his arm. The Forgotten ones did not even have one of these things.
