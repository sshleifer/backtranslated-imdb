This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I was always a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The plot continues, throwing enough key elements of the original to make the term "remake" highly questionable. (He is not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees, WOW!) There are so many things that are meaningless and unexplained, which, I'm afraid, is not a horror movie . (How do two people we've clearly seen explode in a car at the beginning of the movie are still alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks haggard and perplexed, and his character tends to shout "Rowan! ? " at the slightest sound. The "nods" to the original are irritating because they are presented as a tribute rather than a smart tribute. For example, some incidents are like the original (the girl has fallen from a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is looking for the island) and several lines of dialogue are extracted directly from the original script by Anthony Schaffers and have been placed inside. <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this one, I really can not be bothered to write more about this movie. It lacks any type of substance. Throw it in the trash with all the other remakes that tarnished the good names of the movies on which they were "based" (in this case very vaguely).
