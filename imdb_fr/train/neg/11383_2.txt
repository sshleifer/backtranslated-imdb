It's a really awful "B" movie. He is without intelligence and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine "show business", is almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just a pretext for pushing the war effort and highlighting some of the popular music bands of 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about the usual three minutes, with the exception of the Mills Brothers, which, for whatever reason, deserved two figures. Ann Miller can not dance until the last minutes of the film and has nothing to do except strutting in the middle of a patriotic propaganda barrage. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment of the film, in my opinion, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The group seems to play in a train, in uncomfortable positions. (In the far south at the time, the group was separated in railroad cars while on the move.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the final moments of the film, trumpet player and violinist Ray Nance rushes into the camera aisle and makes a "Uncle Tom", banging his eyes and moving his head like Willy Best in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is truly sad. Some movies are better invisible.
