This film was difficult to obtain, and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man profits from the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or spoiling his attempt. With all this intrinsic interest, how could anyone make such a dull and debated film about this real life event? While Williams is still interesting, the writers have assumed that D.B. Cooper's character was stereotypically heroic as a movie star. What we get is a type, with no appealing details or ideas in the mind of a person bold enough and smart enough to be successful. Harrold virtually steals the film with his sperm and pure beauty, but the real disappointment has been in manipulating the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this film for even existing.
