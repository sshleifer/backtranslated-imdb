It's a rather boring film about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and is horribly disfigured when he uses the device to transport himself. Simple terrain done before in the fly and others. Not only is he disfigured, but he can also shock people with a touch. What's really stupid in this film is that we should believe that the place where this guy works is against him. He could probably earn millions for the institution where he works, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. In the end, the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason, then pursues those who have wronged him.
