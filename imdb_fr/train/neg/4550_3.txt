My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a fanatic of these effects, but I really thought that layering was a practice of the bygone past, mostly from the '60s. So, for a while, I thought they might have -being recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut it and take it out. But as far as I know, they did not have a cell phone in the 60's ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is, first of all, a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, the effects are secondary, it does not bother me even with some small inconsistencies. However, in a film like this, the comedian, incredibility, etc., add it to make a bad movie worse - that's what happened to me with the Celestine prophecy. <br /> <br /> Well and even if I'm not in all this spiritual stuff, I can see that it can be presented in a credible way - the film did not manage to do it. <br /> <br /> There could be only one reason to look at this one though. If you really like cheese films, it will be good for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, I MUST have rated this movie as ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are due to the fact that there are worse films, like "Critical Mass" (look at the comments on this one - hilarious). Celestine's prophecy is at least amusing to some degree.
