Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are "so bad they're good," and Zombie 3 is not just bad, is miserable, unforgivable Damage in many ways that a new language may be necessary to describe everything <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film credited to Lucio Fulci who, even according to his criteria, has absolutely no coherence, meaning or reason. However, we can not blame Fulci, who has not really directed it but Bruno Mattei, who does not even have the sense of style Fulci to help with the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film but a stupefying stupidity. <br /> <br /> So I'm ashamed to say how much I enjoyed each worthless minute of Zombi 3. It does not have a redemptive feature - in a known genre for thin characters, the Weak history and lack of talent for cinema, Zombi 3 brings out the boat but it's even funnier than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The action begins when the "Death 1" gas is stolen from a military base and damaged during the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal from it and why did the US military think that creating cannibal legions of undead would be a good idea? All these questions and others will not find any answer in Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief goes crazy about all the green plastecin that develops on his face before being found by the army who decides a little foolishly that the best way to get rid of his corpse will be to burn it, sending "Death 1" in the atmosphere, thus creating ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombies !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why are not zombie birds just attacking other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "heroes", an exciting GI trio and a coach of girls. There are some other guys with them too, but they are not important - no one is important here. You will have a hard time remembering someone's face, let alone his name, or finding a reason to be interested in him. They end up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago, this place was full of life, now there are many flies!") But there is no way to escape undead. <br /> <br /> you will either be completely sucked in or you will have the damn thing off. The scenario is so appalling that even the biggest players in the world have not been able to save it. So they have some of the worst - and not just human characters, the zombie playing here is at its lowest level. The behavior of the zombies is incoherent - some upsets their style, but others engage in fist fights or charge machetes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to speak (a gadget that gives the film HORRIFING TWIST ENDING ). They die gunshots in the chest (rather than the head) and are even stunned by a good left hook. How can you hit a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on the poorly done action of the '80s is often reminiscent of an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently waiting for years. hours in derisory places at random of the poor the sap will pass and will have the fear of their life. They hide in bushes, garages, huts, roofs, in the water and even under pregnant women. At one point, a zombie follows a woman down the stairs. Kill her and eat her? No! To push it in the water, these zombies and their crazy sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There is, however, a lot of gore. The limbs are stung, the wounds are covered with green pus, and there is a lot to do to eat flesh and to make people look good. There is nothing that matches the original eyeball perforation, but if bad makeup effects are your bag, you will not be let down. <br /> <br /> All that, and I did not even mention the awful music, the inexplicable zombie flying head, the scientist whose game manages to stand out as REALLY bad, or the punch Terrifying final ... In an ingenious twist on the original radio station being invaded by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie DJ !! "He went to their side!" our cry as an escaped hero, before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that has unfortunately never happened. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is hogwash - it would not be a waste for the world if every copy was destroyed and everyone traces of its existence are erased, but I feel that my life is richer for to have seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
