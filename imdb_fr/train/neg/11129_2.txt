Look at the 1936 version. Personally boring, I find the voice of Charles Boyer. It is rather a cosmopolitan and depressed pawn, Rudolf - I mean, Omar Sharif tries but, not - too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp), in addition to being too old, has nothing to do with Marie - nothing! She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying of love for this man of this kind. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the whole film that shows the role they play is Ava Gardner, whose role is Empress Elisabeth. on the screen is very brief (and look at images of the Empress there is more than a passing resemblance) because historically, the Empress Elisabeth was not involved as much in Rudolf's life.
