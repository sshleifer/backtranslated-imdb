Disappointing and irritating. The screenwriter does not have a real understanding of human nature, but rather clich√©s in a disjointed way. The character is not explored in depth. They are puppets crushed in a plot that he openly admits require a dramatic element, the case of the mother with the lover of his daughter. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid gives an excellent performance although she is confronted with particular situations and traits, standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slap her. The screenplay portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde does not understand why, except that he sniffs cocaine before the scene. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done a lot more with this subject.
