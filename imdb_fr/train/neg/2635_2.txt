I'm willing to endure a lot of late-summer action movies, but in general, this is because most of them have reasonable benefits (cool special effects, interesting twists, comic value , etc.). Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had none of it. All we got was the cheap excitement of Eva Longoria's several minutes of cleavage (a Maxim issue is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of intrigue, suspense, background, character development, continuity, etc. I would like to go into the details, but frankly, I have already - perhaps willingly forgotten most of the film. <br /> <br /> During all the time I spent at the theater, I hurt myself not to spend the afternoon watching a season of 24 DVDs on DVD. Save your money on this one, the people. Unless you really do not really like Eva Longoria's cleavage.
