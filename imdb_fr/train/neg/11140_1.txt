I thought I was going to watch a horror movie ... and I ended up laughing all along the movie. In the scene where the human has turned into a werewolf, I thought he was joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Small budget, is an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good movie about werewolves. It has good special effects as it should (human transformation into a werewolf). Unless you want to laugh, I would not recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
