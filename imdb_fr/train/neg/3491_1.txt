Apparently, the people who wrote the bottom of the box did not bother to watch what is called "the movie". They described "intrigue and violence blindly choreographed". I did not see any "plot". Instead, I saw a miserable dialogue attempt in a so-called kung fu movie. I did not see any "violence". At least I did not see anything that would make me pause my disbelief as to what could hurt a man with "impenetrable" skin - but here I may have exposed the "plot" too much. In addition, as a spectator of many diverse films (some of which include occasional kung-fu movies), I can say with authority that this piece of celluloid is unassailable. Whatever you choose to do, I will always stay <br /> <br /> Right, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PS I do not I was not blinded by the choreography.
