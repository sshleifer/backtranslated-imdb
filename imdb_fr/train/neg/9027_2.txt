The revenge on us the spectator audience maybe. I attended this two-hour film and waited for the second act to take place so that the film lives up to its title. But Costner never revenges her love destiny, she dies and the film ends. I wondered where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge, the hero would be interested in getting one before the end of the movie. I had the choice to see this or Black Rain at the cinema, luckily, I rather saw the movie The other brothers in the cinema. I caught this turkey video. There was a good thing about the movie and was its beautiful theme. Listen to the CD. Look at it is horrible. 1 of 10
