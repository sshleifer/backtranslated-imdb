In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly has a lot in mind. He thinks about racism, colorism, the media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, heterosexualism, the politics of the drug war, etc., etc. . <br /> <br /> This level of consciousness is clean is great. I think that the fact that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives is a blessing. the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, the fact that Lee makes controversial films does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What comes out of "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, Lee just tries too hard. He seems desperately trying to take into account all the political / social statements he can think about during the 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems confused and unresolved, because it does not leave time to develop characters capable of fully embodying the ideas he hopes to present. And so, it exhausts the stereotypes and we remain with precipitous testimonies and very charged dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, in attempting to make statements about such a variety of societal functions, there seems to be no concrete or original interpretation of the social / political problems presented. What presents itself is a puddle of regurgitated nonsense. You think he bought an elementary sociology textbook and threw up the 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are extremely problematic traits, as the art of the film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the filmmaker. He is unable to distance himself from the work and allow him to speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It works neither as a work of art nor as a valid political argument. <br /> <br /> I always appreciate that Lee raises these important questions, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two bravo.
