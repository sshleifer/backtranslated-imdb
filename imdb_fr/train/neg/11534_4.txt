* WARNING * Contains a LOT OF SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me begin by saying that I have tremendous respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a versatile and versatile actress - that's why I can not understand the reasons for which she agreed to do movie once she saw the script (or lack thereof.) <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie was, in my opinion, a great idea. There were truly inspiring themes that provoked reflection, but ended up resembling a collapsed soufflé. This illustrates why I hate 99% of British cinema. It's been too long, it's tedious for most, and there's not much going on after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a chance that it gets faster, it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With a little imaginative staging and a minimalist intrigue, nothing prevents the public from sinking into popcorn. As far as the screenplay is concerned, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save some trees, the average scene reading something like "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam looks in. Adam goes down into the woods ) (Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I guess, word for word, the actors were probably better paid than Kate Moss for her Virgin Mobile commercials. The few lines there were not many variations with frequent use of the word f that would make the pride of Bridget Jones's friend, Shazza. There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event, which leaves the spectator a lack of sympathy for the characters, beyond an automatic reaction "Oh that's terrible". <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman who sympathizes with the courts either. She has a good job, an expensive London apartment with a roof space to die for but she appears on the screen as pretentious, bitter and unsatisfied before her life deteriorates. After the attack, some layers are removed, which somehow explains why she's like that at the beginning. she grew up with a tough soldier who thought that learning to shoot with one's weapon was the ultimate expression of love. Instead of following in her footsteps, she fled to the big city in search of something to make her feel that her life is worth living. Instead, she found a group of stereotypical middle-class Toffs who despised anyone who was not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxury associated with an integrated safety / entertainment system (ie, becoming Mrs Robinson for a whimsical electrician Cockney) Someone passes me a handkerchief. The only saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a minor actress, she would have been intolerably unidimensional, but Mrs. Anderson manages to inject a fleeting moment of humanity into this lifeless human being, especially when she apologizes sincerely for her rage at the wheel in an attempt vain to prevent his attackers from continuing their assault. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam did much better either. Danny Dyer played very well in Jack the Lad, a fish out of the water, but a good performance could not save him from the absence of scenario and the total absence of character background. <br /> <br /> This film was mainly based on the value of depreciation, but the timing was wrong and it seemed far too elaborate from beginning to end. Regarding the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of Mrs. Anderson's painful thinness; it was almost as disturbing to see as the scenes of brutal attack. Moreover, in a British film, a group of violent sex offenders would take the time to afford contraception before continuing to encourage their comrades - talk about the stiffness of the upper lip pushed to the extreme! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery gives money to do, I'm not surprised to see fewer and fewer people choosing to spend their books every week. <br /> <br /> To say that I hated this film is to give it too much credit, I did not worry enough about the characters to justify this emotion. I want to find those few hours of my life, please!
