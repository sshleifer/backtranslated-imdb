This is not a comment on the film but on the release of the DVD RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there were different versions and updates, but the records we rented had a copyright of 2000, if that meant something. Anyway, the audio mix on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. Levels often yo-yo-up; When the scene stood out in a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track thundered so loud that I did not know which one would explode first - my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time to talk, the volume usually fell to something barely audible. From time to time the orchestra and Foley's work remained noisy while the dialogue was superimposed on a much smaller level. My wife and I discovered that the only way to watch this movie from these DVDs was to let one of us keep our hand on the remote control to continuously modulate the volume. And, as another user has already commented, when we selected English audio, the dialog box kept switching between Russian and English. and sometimes when the characters were speaking in French on the native track, the dubbing was in Russian, so you are SOL if you do not understand one or the other. In the end, we stopped watching after the first disc. Before you spend more than $ 50 for this DVD movie in your own library, I highly recommend you get a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie while you are overwhelmed never reading the book and really want to understand the scenario.
