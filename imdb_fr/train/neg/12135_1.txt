Even if it's been 2 years, I still remember the total loss that composes the plot of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it by browsing the new versions of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the film because it was the only movie we had not seen yet and it seemed to be nice. Although I have not watched the movie for a long time, I still remember the lack of intrigue (seriously, there is no real plot) and the total waste of time that has been spent watching the film. If you're in the video store and this movie catches your eye, keep going and find a better movie. If you ended up watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
