This kind of narration is unacceptable The only reason this movie is above the 5 stars out of 10 is because it has George Lucas behind, and it carries the words "Star" and "Wars" in its title . It's an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing, and acting, but who have not had the credit. This is a parody. <br /> <br /> First of all. The story. The evolution of Anakin? There are not any. Apart from a little makeup around the eyes and a little scream, there is none. He becomes young, stupid and insolent from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in one fell swoop. The only thing that was consistent with Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was in almost everything he did, plan, fight, and so on. The only coherent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the previous trilogy is his constant stupidity. He even loses his body because of a stupidity crisis. <br /> <br /> Which part of Emperor Palpatine telling him the legends of the Sith does not suggest that the emperor is a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Combat scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone flies like a teddy bear in an imaginary dollhouse. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost all fighters had a rubbery double jump. <br /> <br /> In a specific battle scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the decisive battle, they stop in the middle of parries and riposts, spin their swords a few times while separating them from a few centimeters. I realize that the fights are choreographed, but it just made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was awful. All the dialogues were extremely mediocre. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did their best with their lines, but that was not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, holes larger than the center of the universe, and no preview of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is offered. We know that the approximate image of everything, all that Lucas did, is to color it. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin had lost his limbs. We knew that Luke and Leia were brothers and sisters, we knew that Luke was Anakin's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda were going into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this film. If that's all the fans wanted, so much the better, so Lucas would not have been wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin ends up becoming Darth Vader, he asks after Padme and learns that she is dead, he reaches out his arms clumsily and shouts "Nooooooooooooooooooooo." This scene shouted all the way through Movie B, and I was almost expecting Darth Vader to say "DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER" at any time. It is what it is. A film B, disguised by a huge budget and an ultra-loyalist fan base that will solve the disaster now that the first two films have brought their standards to the lowest of the Earth.
