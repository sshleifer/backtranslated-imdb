First of all, I was expecting "Caged Heat" to look like "Ilsa, the perverse guardian". Boy, was I wrong? This film is by no means an exploitation of the 70s, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". Of course, the plot is composed of a group of women in prison who wear city clothes (quite funny), but NOTHING happens. <br /> <br /> There is no strong rivalry, no one tries to seduce the guardian or doctor to try to escape, and no inmate gets away with it. There are 2 shower scenes, I guess these are just recycled pictures, but no fights are going on / no one is seduced here - or anywhere else! Aside from the lack of intrigue, unconvincing characters, unfriendly and dishonest, a couple of inmates who manage to escape effectively return to prison in order to "free" their fellow prisoners ?? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the film should have ended with the departure of the escapees at sunset ... instead of letting this mess go on! <br /> <br /> I feel scammed.
