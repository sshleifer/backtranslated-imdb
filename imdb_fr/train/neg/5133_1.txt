I had no real expectations in this film and I am happy. Even though I was expecting it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think that 15% of the film consisted of still scarecrow archive footage in a dark jungle field. I understood. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing is explained regarding scarecrows and paranormal events. Too often did I go to WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the film is taken seriously. I'm all for a movie B with buckets of blood, screaming women and insane violence following a simple psychopath or an old curse. But these films often know that they are serial movies and even show them, like Dead Snow (Scandinavian zombies hilarious movie) or Evil Dead 2. But this film seems to ignore his fiasco. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you're going to have a shitty horror movie, do it with the murder. And if you want to have a hot girl and a half-hot girl, one of them must show a bottom ass at a minimum. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary recapitulates, skip "Scarecrows" and just poke in the eye. You will thank me.
