I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones has started making some of the most incredibly annoying cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once in this short film, and it's a cartoon of Bugs Bunny, for the sake of Christ! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short film turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly annoying short film by Jones) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first harbinger of a dull cartoon still has no financial value. Elmer's Good Night was boring as it still resulted in the same gags with predictable results. This drawing, on the other hand, is distressed by the second warning sign of a cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The cartoon has at least two gags in its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finished dinner and commented, "It was a good thing, it's the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a caricature (characters read aloud in Woody's cartoons Woodpecker of the later era). do not count in my book). Even if this caricature lasts only 8 minutes, it gives about 20 minutes thanks to a redundant dialogue. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a funny caricature for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to recognize that he has run a few clunkers during his career you could enjoy it.
