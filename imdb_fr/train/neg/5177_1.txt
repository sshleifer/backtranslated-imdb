It's so bad, really bad. The acting game is the biggest joke in history. I did not even bother to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was as disappointing in the end as at the beginning ... I really do not understand the taste of people, I am a Horror movie fan and I am not tedious but I have a limit! It was maybe a quarter of a star better than the beginning of The Hoast but that's it. I recommend you not to lose the 15 minutes you can watch. I mean that the acting is better done by the monkeys. And the big brother with the parenting is really awful. Do not they pay the characters in C movies? No, I must say that this is not the first time I think a horror movie is bad, but it's absolutely one of my last ten movies and it will be charing places with Portrait of a vampire, Cabin at the lake, The Hoast!
