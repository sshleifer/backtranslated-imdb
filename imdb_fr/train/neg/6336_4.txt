The Bliss theme update is only the latest in a long list of mediocre local comedies that appeal to the conservative cinematic ensemble. (For the record, this list, all the films on which there seems to be a castle-esque miracle, includes, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, the Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. worked on was Crackerjack.) <br /> <br /> Here, the performances never fit together, because John Howard does not even seem to be in the good movie ?? although that may have been the intent, as Franklin plays in a sleepy, conservative suburb against his most interesting inhabitants. The 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are increasingly rare on the screen, but that's no reason to watch the movie. In fact, the only reasons could be (1) The weird of Howard ?? but enough fun ?? performance, and (2) the "suburban nightmare" theme, which crossed Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Lake Placid, Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, several which are very good / excellent. Enter at your own risk! Maybe one for people who tickle the word "penis". 4/10.
