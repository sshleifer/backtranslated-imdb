This is a typical 70's type in the Russ Meyer genre, although perhaps less strange than some of Meyer's work. This film has higher "production values" than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's the plot, the writing and the acting straight out of the B area. Recently, this movie has become one of the pillars of the B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the universe of 500 channels. If you are in a sensual mood, you are as talented as any other element of the B range. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. No more no less. Jennifer Welles' performance as "mother" is perhaps the best in the cast. None of the actors of the film knew a greater fame, without surprise. The confessions of a young American housewife are far from being the worst example of this kind. It is visible if it's your type of movie. Thirty years ago, it would have been a film of avant-garde and riske. You can see more or less the same kind of thing on the Showtime / HBO series these days and in prime time.
