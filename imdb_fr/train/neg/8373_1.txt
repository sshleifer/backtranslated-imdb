I was not impressed by this film, especially because I went to the movies with my family in good faith to see a 12A-certified film here in the UK. To my dismay, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (This is not a problem for me as an adult, but is not good for watching with children). This film was sometimes very rude with pet jokes, blows in the groin, etc ... and for most of the film not very funny. <br /> <br /> The principle of the film is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2-inch dwarf, gets out of jail and steals a giant-sized diamond, but is then forced to put it in a woman's purse. Thus, the rest of the film sees him pretending to be an abandoned baby, to enter this house for women to be able to recover this diamond. <br /> <br /> So far, I've been taking advantage of the essential Wayans Brothers - but this film certainly takes the biscuit. <br /> <br /> Good advice - wait until it's broadcast on TV or cable
