This movie looks a lot like "Flashdance", you know this dance movie with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring movie I have ever seen because it's not even serious enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than this movie, but it does not say much. Here, Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is high music and we can see her fighting and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think that the idea behind the film is rather interesting, but the script is too clich√© and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
