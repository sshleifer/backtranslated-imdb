The wicker man. I am so angry that I can not write a correct comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, finely knotted and totally lame. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assumed that since you were there, it would be at least decent. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I felt as if huge parts of the film had been left on the floor of the editing room, and even though it was complete, the movie was just ridiculous and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In the end, you are speechless, confused and offended. I have never heard so many people leaving the theater on the opening day with so much hatred. People complained in small groups in the mall, four stories from the theater near the entrance. It's so serious. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he did not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
