I remember watching ATTACK when he came out for the first time and caught him again recently. The science fiction channel went bad, but not much. An unscrupulous swindle from Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces saber-toothed cats with dinosaurs. And they are free, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and close-ups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. We get a little gore, which helps a little. Wait to see how the mad scientist who started this whole bazaar gets it. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the casting is unknown. Apparently, it was shot in Fiji. Good job if you can get it. It reminds me of all those low-budget monster SUVs that were popular in the '80s and' 90s.
