The December specials, like the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy, light story. They should have a touch of mystical holiday magic. Basically, they should look, look and feel ... good, "special" and have a decent and decent subtext for the December holidays. <br /> <br /> So when I saw Legend of Frosty, the snowman, on TV my kids (ages 6 to 8) had the courage to tell them the story of the original Frosty and telling with passion how much I enjoyed my childhood. While my wife and children sat on the couch to watch the movie, expectations were high, but after 10 minutes, my children were yawning and my wife and I were giving each other "eyes" and rolling eyes. After 35 minutes, my kids were actually going to bed - I guess they were fed up with insensitive language and unnecessary and disconnected segments. I was really embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents, with a worse-than-normal spongebob episode than a classic vacation movie. Do not get me wrong ... these shows are good and I love them as much as the next, but when I look at Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob, my expectations are low (mediocre, discolored, zero subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We chose good books and spent the whole evening reading together. A much better choice than the very embarrassing Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
