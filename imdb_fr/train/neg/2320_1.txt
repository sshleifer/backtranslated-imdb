This film is made for the Asian / Chinese market and is particularly aimed at fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest stars of Asian music. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented singer-songwriter. He is a mediocre actor, even though he has participated in several big-budget productions ("D initial", "The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he won the "Golden Horse" (Taiwan) and Hong Kong Film Awards for the "First Film D". <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are very well chosen, which everyone likes to China. The cast includes many famous film and television actors, singers and even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they did not have time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu took the position of director and screenwriter. He has the reputation of making superficial and brainless films based on non-coherent scripts. With his poor staging and screenplay, the whole talented cast, the fanciful vision effects and the tones of production money were wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the terrible film has brought in more than $ 10 million or more in Asia. , which made this movie one of the biggest hits at the Asian box office. <br /> <br /> The result is this: you can only watch this film if you want to see the waste of money and talent, or simply accompanying your child Jay Chou fans.
