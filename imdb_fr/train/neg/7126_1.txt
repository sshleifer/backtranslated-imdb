I mean, I thought I heard that dialogue in the movie, but it was so out of place that I can not really believe it. I laughed so hard about what must have been the worst writing and acting in the history of humanity, I was seriously afraid of having a heart attack and dying in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother crash and his brother's car exploded right next to him (the hero). The "hero" was preparing the "crisis" expected to see something so tragic and people were trying to stop him from running in the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his crisis and his uncontrollable rage / emotional breakdown, he says "I'm so sad" - he said that no? Am I crazy?
