Although I've never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its horrible production values), it seems that Shakespeare is compared to this pile of shit brought by Hanna-Barbera! Scrappy-Doo is without a doubt the most boring and horrible character created for children (and this includes Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Who had the brilliant idea to create a kind of little mutant dog and allow him to talk and saddle with the Scooby-Doo characters ?! Whoever deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is better). The bottom line is that the little dog is just ridiculous, annoying and cringe on the nerves - and only in the best episodes !! After many years, it would have been better to end the franchise rather than create this mess! I can understand why in the Scooby-Doo movie they did the Scrappy-Doo villain - since almost everyone hates him!
