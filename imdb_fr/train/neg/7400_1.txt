I've seen some really bad movies, and it's just up there. No plot, strictly speaking, it's like one of those bad episodes of coma on a soap opera. I just wanted to hit that little girl because, let's face it, she's really suspicious all the way through the movie. Monsters running bling were funny. I also saw some "Silent Hill" there. And I read that it was done by and or watched a Finnish metal band, Lordi. It is not surprising that this does not make much sense. This seems like a way to promote their group and nothing more. The effects are very good, the look of the movie, the monsters, and even the acting are equally good. But story and narration are just not there.
