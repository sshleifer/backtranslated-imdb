Horrible actor, horrible casting and cheap accessories. Would have been a lot better if was defined as a parody style action movie. Such a waste. Starting with the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The enemy" to name it "Action Movie" would have made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The policeman looking like a 60-year-old girl, the blonde girl always has the same empty and boring look. Towards the end of the film, he and she work together to eliminate the bad guys and every time they exchange words, it's like being in the least expensive talk in front of a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
