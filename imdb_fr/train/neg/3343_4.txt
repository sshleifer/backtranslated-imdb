Interesting story of a soldier in a war that fails to save the life of a girl of the enemy and who is haunted by this event, even if he saved many other captive children. The film flickers a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school run mainly by police patrolling corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or their principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides that he will stop teaching and go to another area. However, the director asks him to set up a detention class as the last teacher's job. It is at this stage of the film that hell is unleashed and history becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it, if you have decided to View IT!
