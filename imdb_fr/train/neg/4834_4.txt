I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great impatience after the endless hype and the 6 Oscars that were awarded to her. Unfortunately, it's not really a good movie. The description of the situation certainly seemed accurate and credible in all respects, but beyond that, the story seemed simply incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and uncertain. The actors made a good effort, but for me, I did not really understand what the film wanted to be. It's not as atmospheric and captivating as Full Metal Jacket, nor as epic as Band of Brothers, nor as action-packed as ... well, anything. I certainly can not see why he was nominated so much, or why people let themselves go to these epic proportions. Remember, given the caliber of the films over the past two years, I guess there is not much choice.
