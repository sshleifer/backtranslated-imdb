David Arquette is a young and naive alarm salesman at home. <br /> <br /> taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy <br /> <br />, making a big sale in his first call to the widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and his son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well for Arquette, he appears in the commercials of the security firm and he falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right-hand wife, Mary McCormack, let him <br /> <br /> confiscate a little secret - they sometimes break into their family's home. <br /> customers to scare them and get their neighbors to buy the company's <br /> <br /> security systems. Arquette decides not to get involved <br /> <br /> by taking Capshaw to meet his family and passing through life <br /> <br /> with a silly smile. Then, someone enters the house of <br /> <br /> Capshaw and the murderer with his son. Arquette suspects Tucci and installs a series of traps that result in a weapon at the head of his boss <br /> <br /> while Tucci pleads his innocence. <br /> <br /> According to a play, "Alarmist" is not open. The scenes <br /> <br /> where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents <br /> <br /> are badly played and totally insane. <br /> <br /> they are not in line with the character that Capshaw plays, as she gets drunk and tells <br /> <br /> sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother, Michael Learned . <br /> <br /> Other than these scenes, Capshaw does not have much to do, but she <br /> does a lot with the little given to her. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, looking like Terry O'Quinn, is rioting as the owner of the security firm <br /> <br />. He is a pretentious man who does not really understand Arquette's moral revulsion. However, when he turns into a plaintive crying after Arquette has kidnapped him, he is hilarious. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a larger role, but she generally agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a silly teen, but he's funny especially <br /> <br /> telling his own explicit sexual history to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The screenplay also goes from romantic comedy to black comedy <br /> soon. Capshaw meets the parents is completely unmotivated, except to give him a reason to get out of town so that someone can <br /> <br /> break into her home. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie just to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who proved himself a good actor, is awful here. <br /> <br /> He relies on the constipated aggression that allowed him to cross these <br /> <br /> AT & T commercials, and he is not present enough to build this <br> /> <br /> weakness filming around. In fact, Reynolds might have been a better choice in the role. <br /> <br /> The management of Dunsky is good, nothing that will soon win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The light jazz music of Christophe Beck recalls the type of film noir that this film tries to be, and it is really catchy and more. <br /> <br /> Despite the benefits, Arquette's failure to track and the schizophrenic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> quality of the screenplay make the film flow. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for physical violence, gun violence, some bloody, <br /> <br /> strong profanation, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexuality <br /> <br /> references and situations for adults.
