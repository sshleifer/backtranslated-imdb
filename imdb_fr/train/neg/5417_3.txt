Three Russian aristocrats are immersed in the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use casino tickets, hoping to exchange counterfeit currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, US envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen. They both decide to make friends with visitors, hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with continued progress towards Helen, while disappointing the count's maid, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the inappropriate behavior of aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the film can really annoy the modern public, like me, by doing that. Even acting, which is awesome in later EVS, like Greed and Wedding March, is just a breeze here. The film could have used improvements at different levels. Note, 3.
