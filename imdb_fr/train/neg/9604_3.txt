The first thing I noticed in this movie was of course the useless amount of nudity. It's not nudity or anything else, but a lot of useless things. Annik Borel plays a troubled woman who believes in the ghost stories of her family that her ancestor who strangely resembles her was a werewolf and believes that their destiny is destined to be the same. Which in fact I found quite interesting. The first wolf man was supposed to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal added the real wolf man that you should never have seen for one or two extra dollars. I find this concept of someone who is not really an interesting werewolf. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know he's not a werewolf since the beginning. scenario. They also fail by adding one or two parts of the film that refers to this as reality. At first, I was excited to read the movie description. But I slowly realized that it was a jacket to expose as much as possible the breasts of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a big psychotic role, or a very bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since Danniele's character has no brain and is just crazy, he's crazy, growls and slams like a wolf, he needs little talent to play it. She has moments when her performance pauses, but is quickly spoiled by the poor work of the camera and light. The idea is good, but runs hideously throughout the film. 3/10
