I must admit from the outset that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, he gets "no respect" from me. I watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It is full of cruel and lame jokes and a totally ridiculous plot around a developer's project (Dangerfield) to build a ski resort in Utah that just did not catch my eye. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield the film featured a weak cast, like Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (I did not even know he was still there before seeing his name in the credits). <br /> <It's really a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
