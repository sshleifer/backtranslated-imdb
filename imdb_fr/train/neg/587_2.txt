This film differs from the banal documentary "of the wonder of the human body" by its courage, even if it is bizarre, by choosing to arouse the disgust of the spectator. In a scene, the camera sinks into a gigantic zit, while a teenager draws pus and liquid. In another case, the camera is semi-immersed in a swamp of half-digested food and stomach acids, while parts of a pasta salad fall from the esophagus and collapse into the fire. For a last feat, the camera takes the viewer through a heartbreaking forest through a forest of ... teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I do not invent anything. Watch this movie if you must, but bring your bag of vomit and do not take pasta salad in advance.
