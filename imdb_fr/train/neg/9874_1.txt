A fabulous book about a fox and his family doing what foxes do. this being stealing farms and killing prey. until a trio of peasants decide that they are fed up with this fox and are trying different ways to "solve" the problem. They are of course "mowed" at every turn and while the trio camps with the fox, the family raids against the lands of the three farmers. Movie term very vaguely, is more of a god pastiche god of American hold-up movies especially Oceans movies. They even have George Clooney as Mr. Fox add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story completely. Congratulations to them. They will earn a lot of money and destroy another classic children's book by Roald Dahl.
