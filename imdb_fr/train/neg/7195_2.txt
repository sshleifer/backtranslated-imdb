Disney did it again. The company that directed "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and retains no spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite drawings when I was young, and for a film from this film, existing at the time might have become a dream. Now that this film exists, I have been seriously disappointed, even scandalized. <br /> <br /> We have the characters first. <br /> <br /> Gadget himself has the gadgets that made it such a fun character the original drawing (with well-made special effects accompanying them), and it even has some of the naivety of the original gadget, but he is now more competent and should solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain observe. <br /> <br /> Penny has little to do; as she played a major role in caricature, discovering crime and ending it, and sometimes being captured by MAD agents, she is now simply presented and forgotten, though she sneaks into at least the base of Claw. <br /> <Claw is the version of Dr. Claw's film, a rather sinister, hoarse man, who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, while stroking his cat and supervising various crimes. Now he is just a man with a claw against a hand, without a mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant for him. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the caricature are not spared in this butchery. The famous phrase "Wowsers!" has been mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and Gadgetmobile from Gadget now looks different and discusses. <br /> <br /> There are even product brands all over the world. Why "Yahoo!" advertised on a sign? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M's or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Fans of the cartoon will hate it, others may find the film below average, and when all is said and done, this movie will be a new attempt to make a few dollars quickly on another old show.
