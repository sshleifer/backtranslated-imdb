This adaptation positively abolishes a classic that is appreciated for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has no idea of ​​the different shades of the Rochester character. I have the impression that he never even read the book, he was content to put his panties too tight and was given a summary of the character who said "Grumpy, broody, dark dark." He embodies Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as a grumpy man who never smiles until he has been engaged, and miraculously turns into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited me was disbelief and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who certainly turns in his grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND MORE: A "LOVELY" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU MUST EAT HER FACE.
