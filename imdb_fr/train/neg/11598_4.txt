When you look at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy's Revenge, you should at least give it credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new to the show. Yes, there is creative death as usual, as if a child was part of a comic and was facing "Super Freddy", but even scenes like that are not being used to their full potential and parties without Freddy are just boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of fear in the series. Freddy seems to be comic relief now ... but for what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
