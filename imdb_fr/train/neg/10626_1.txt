This documentary is based on the sponge cake as soon as you put a REAL proof, the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of shit, for example Bart Sibrel says that they must have several sources of light, because the shadows seem to be to cross if it was the case. In this case, there would not be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 passed through Van Allan's radiation belts. They would have spent 30 minutes and not the 90 minutes claimed in the documentary. They would have received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an object. X-ray. <br /> <br /> seriously do some research to find out what happened do not let this shit pile of a documentary cast your opinion of what really happened
