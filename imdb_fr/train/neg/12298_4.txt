"Witchery" is perhaps the most incoherent and miserably scripted horror film of the 1980s, but fortunately it has some offsetting qualities such as fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score, and extraordinary casting choices. . Honestly, the script does not make sense, but no matter when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) describes yet another girl possessed by evil forces and that David Hasselhof represents a hunky photographer (who seems unable to get fucked) ) a film that constantly presents bloody voodoo, stitched lips, upside-down crucifixions, vicious burns, and an overused but truly frightening melody. Eight randomly selected people are gathered on an abandoned resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the dark history of the place; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda, although no one seems to care about who the father is and where her parents are) plans to reopen the hotel and the delightful architect just got her to occasional sex. They are forced to spend the night at the dilapidated hotel, then suddenly the previous owner ?? an aging actress or something who always dresses in black ?? start taking them in various captivating ways. Everything is in some way related to the introductory sequence showing a woman accused of witchcraft jumping out the window. Anyway, the plot is obviously of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that began as an unofficial derivative of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing and the effects of make-up are undoubtedly the most superior element of the whole film. There is something extremely morbid and disturbing about watching a helpless woman hanging from a fireplace and waiting to be fried.
