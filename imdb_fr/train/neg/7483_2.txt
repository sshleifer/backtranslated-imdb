One would think (as I did) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should at least be decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently, I was grossly mistaken - this is one of the worst of my films. already seen. I do not know how much one joke after another can be so profoundly unfathomable. It made me sad to watch these talented actors perform one of the most disappointing scenarios I have had the misfortune to encounter. Based solely on the big names, I remained optimistic for the duration of the film, but it still has not provided entertainment, either. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try with movies and in life stay away from skewed comments and general generalizations. But with this film, it's hard not to let go. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, the big Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than that. It's easily one of the worst comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> I tried to appreciate that - I really liked it. But non-residents eventually fail miserably. If you really want a quick entertainment, take your money and watch it swirl when you throw it in the toilet. Please, do not watch this movie.
