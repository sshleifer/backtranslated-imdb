Absolutely the worst film of Burton, which seems to worsen every film he makes. A miserable scenario loaded with clich√©s is only the first of the many questionable aspects of this film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout "He lost his weapon!" or anything for everyone to know. Carter is really horrible, as is Wahlberg, who does not know how to play well and who is convincing. Beautiful effects and photographs, but poor music in the mold John Williams of Burton's boyfriend, Elfman. Heston appears in a senseless scene to express his most famous slogans of the first film. Very bad result. <br /> <br /> If someone else has also seen "Sleepy Hollow", he will probably have noticed, just like me, the degradation of the quality of Burton's films. I heard that this project was done by other people and that Burton was appointed director. In this case, his judgment should be questioned. But I think he let slip any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career; the proof is there in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow", he was unable to decide what kind of movie he was doing, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.). ) has also made you think of some kind of monster rally movie (these are never scary, as horror fans know). The film could not succeed either on horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style was developed to combine the two. "Planet of the Apes" is a bit the same thing, and the result is more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than science fiction. He has also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors in order to satisfy everyone possible. Burton, if you're there - pick something and do it directly, or use a style to combine it (like in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you could just as well pull out, because people like me, fans of your movies will stop.
