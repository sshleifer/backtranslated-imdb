I love watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this bad excuse for a soft-core porn movie is unnecessarily offensive, lacks nothing that looks like wit and is simply a means of personal promotion for Springer. Even if it lasts 90 minutes, the film drags hideously, and I should have had the good sense to go out. Simply atrocious.
