I'm not aware of the trilogy but I came across this film last night at Showtime. The film looked very well done with scenography and cinematography, but the script was on stilts and wood. The acting was pretty bad, the two women leaders being usable. You never really believed anything from the support actors. There was the Reverend striking Bibles - without any hint, the authoritarian captain, the hard-headed soldier, and so on. The end credits of Telefilm Canada gave it. I know that I am a horrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe something escaped me at first, but hostility to girls is never explained. Here, they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men waste their time and energy by brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. It's a little more pressing beyond your walls than to know if these girls are lesbians - it's just my conclusion to the hostility towards them. If they can aim and shoot with a gun, you might as well please them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> In addition, I guess this concerns the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists? One of them murdered the Indian guy in the end who saved one of their lives. I suppose that one is just a victim of his condition, of which one can not necessarily blame his actions, but the other is only a murderer who does not deserve his happy ending.
