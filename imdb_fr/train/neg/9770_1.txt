This is the version that even the author hated, because it's so schmaltzy. They put a happy end to it and changed the dialogue a lot, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. The "stage manager" is pretty good, I think he's at the origin of the role, but everyone falls into the 40s actor style that really poses. The great feature - the music. This is one of the best scores ever recorded, and it is worth looking into a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is far superior.
