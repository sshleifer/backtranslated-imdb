An ill-conceived "blaxploitation" detective drama was aimed directly at the black urban market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier plays the leading role in the lead role, that of a nurse who becomes an independent woman after thugs drug traffickers make from Coffy's little sister, a drug addict. A violent nonsense advances stubbornly, with energy and canned excitement; only the fiery temperament of Grier gives a shock to the story (she is not really an actress here, but she connects with the audience more importantly). Not very different from what Charles Bronson was doing at the time, the film was commercialized and advertised as a dirty exploitation, while still finding a significant audience in the downtown core. Today, however, it is only a footnote in the history of cinema in the 1970s and the attractiveness of other films of this kind. * 1/2 of ****
