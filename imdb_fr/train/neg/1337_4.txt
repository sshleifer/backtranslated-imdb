Yes, you guessed it. Another film where identical twins change places. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older, they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like a "Full House" replay. If you plan to see this movie, do not do it. Look at 'The Parent Trap' instead. It's more entertaining.
