I had the (bad) chance to see this film during a screening in the United States. After reluctantly attending all this abyssal history, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but interesting. It was part of that history of the 1969 revolution in the early 1970s; this movie just stinks of ......., well, nothing really. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a badly made perfume advertisement - do you know what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna has never been able to act, and has been embarrassing on the big screen for years. It looks worse and worse with each of these years and looks more and more like a Scottish meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, will never be able to direct either - his films are shallow parades, poorly cut. He does not disappoint here either; he wisely designated his wife as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please, do not pay attention to the good reviews this movie has received from the other posters below. These are obviously factories. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money. <br /> <br />
