It's not a dreadful comedy, but it's very DULL. He scarcely laughs and wastes his lavish production values. There is a moving moment towards the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and says, "You were my only worthy opponent, and now we can start all over again." This scene, however, with Burt Kwouk's fun cameo at first, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
