This was put on the DVD market by Alpha, and it is reserved for hardcore fans of Boris Karloff (like me). This is not a horror movie, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist who agrees to kill the husband of a wealthy woman in order to earn the fortune necessary to continue his work. But once the dying victim has changed his will and left nothing to his wife, hell is unleashed. <br /> <br /> It's quite soothing to see Karloff as another sinister and selfish type, and some acts are unintentionally hilarious (especially the mistress Mona Goya's wife who is really a riot laugh like the cross woman). <br /> <br /> But let's proceed with a lot of caution.
