What was all this? I saw the matrix and I was amazed. It was the most spectacular film ever made. What the Wachowski brothers have always possessed to make this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can not say as much. Basically, all this movie was a conversation, and do not get me wrong, I do not have a problem with spoken movies, but everything you said in The Matrix Reloaded was a useless load of motivation. Then there would be a fight sequence that would last MUCH too long, then a more useless fight, then another battle scene that lasts too long and everything is built to the greatest anti-climax of all time. A small bearded guy talking an incomprehensible bull charge for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves is giving his worst performance so far. I knew he was not a good actor but it was beyond a joke. If you watch his films in the order in which he was, it would seem that he is getting worse and worse. God knows what his performance looks like in Something must be given! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board ever to be an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, it was a massive disappointment. If you have not seen the first movie yet, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time with this pile of shit. <br /> <br />
