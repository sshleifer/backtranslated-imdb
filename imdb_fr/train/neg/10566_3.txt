Although I consider myself a fan of the TV show Babylon 5, the original movie that introduced the series was a start shy. Although many of the elements that later mature and become much more convincing in the series are already there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate and the intrigue confusing. Even worse, the characterization in the first episode is mediocre. Although the rating chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these issues, I remember The Gathering, almost making me forget what would soon become a spectacular series.
