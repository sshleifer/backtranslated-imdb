Moron and his girlfriend are organizing a ritual to resurrect the dead, in order to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Unsurprisingly, they resuscitated a dead soul who began cutting them with an ax, and the next day university people telling the story around a campfire. The guy with the ax gets up and starts to hack the idiots who tell the story. The group calls the cops, the cop sees the blood splashing everywhere and thinks it's a mountain lion (!?) And soon after he's killed by a deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic little splashing film that was shot in broad daylight but where many characters carry flashlights and talk as if it was in the middle of the night and wanted to send a signal rocket to attract l 'Warning. One guy has a weapon in one hand and bullets in the other, but does not bother to charge it. After loading him, he has several opportunities to shoot the murderer, but does not bother, because that would end the movie. too early. Then he throws the gun! Characters who show no emotion and do not seem worried after their friends are crumbling and have ugly effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car exploded in the end was clearly a car model) and a hideous dialogue and really ugly female nudity do not help. And in the end, he tries to get away with his inconsistency by saying that it was all the invention of the same college seniors who were telling campfire stories at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer really appears in the last scene, he tears them to pieces. Once again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre like this, good only for some involuntary laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
