Although the beginnings suggest All Quiet on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of the war is moving away from its much better contemporary. This represents the most entertaining war ever, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see a battle, it is black: an enemy plane flies over? Shoot him down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets hurt. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Do not worry, they go willingly. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Warm, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
