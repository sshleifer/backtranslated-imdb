It seems that everything is going well, any film featuring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if it's the fact that the story is full of holes or that Dolph is such a bad actor. No spoiler here, it seems to have been too late for the things that grow, grow and attract and that touch in this film In my opinion, it is amazing that some of these projects find venture capital to enter the box and theater.
