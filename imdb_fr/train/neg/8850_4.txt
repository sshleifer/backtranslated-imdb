Now, this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons: two big reasons and one smaller: well, that's three reasons, is not it? <br /> <br /> The first reason for this is interesting is the special effects. I found them quite interesting and somewhat spectacular. Seeing hair grow on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was scary, especially when they were participating in a threesome. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" of the song of the Rolling Stones, and that she was in the famous nude scene in the London casting of the musical Rock Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two other important points in this film, and they were highlighted repeatedly during the closing credits. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning has revealed these points in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe a lot more. Theyu was the most remarkable feature of the film.
