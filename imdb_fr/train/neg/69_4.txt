I thought it was a very clumsy and uninvolved version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave a personality to their characters. but everything felt forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have been much more complex; maybe starting with a shootout, then coming back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I had the impression that each scene was systematically predictable and reported, like a very bad soap opera. <br /> <br /> I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in her favor is that she beats Mick Jagger's version, but not much.
