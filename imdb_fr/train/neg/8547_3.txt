It was a pretty scary movie; I found the music effective for that. The photographs that Mario took from the village were also annoying. However, I had three problems with this movie. The first is that the lighting was very dark, so it was sometimes difficult to say what was happening, but maybe it's my copy. The second is that the very beginning is not very well explained and that I am still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but apparently some people understand it. Of course, there are also the usual problems of people who do silly things, and the main male role is very 70 years old. Overall, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.
