I note this movie with 3 skulls, only because the girls knew how to shout, it could have been a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were OK, I thought they were bad, but the elder brother and the most young, they were really bad, they looked like they were reading the scripts instead of playing them .... spoiler: if they are vampires, why are they freezing blood? the vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister of the movie tells them to drink it while she's alive ... but then, when they move to another house, they take a cooler, their frozen blood. end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> it was a huge waste of time, and it drove me crazy because I had read all the reviews about the quality of this film, the number of awards won by this film * *** ing s ** t !!!!
