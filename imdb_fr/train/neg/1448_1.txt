Having grown up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what was previously Gilley, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live as this movie indicates. The plot is weak and the fake accents are fun and reinforce the stereotypical image that all Texans drink beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The awful faux accents of Texas are what kill him for me. While most Texans have a special focus in Texas, they abuse it. You can not have someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Texas accents. It does not work. John Travolta should have remained faithful to disco-dance or the 1950s. Debra Winger was more convincing as a Wonder Girl than she was in Texan.
