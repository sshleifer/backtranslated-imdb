My first exposure to Templarios and not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offers of Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other cult classics such as "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but that alone does not hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers take a terrible revenge on the Templars (and put everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, heavy and ultimately unsatisfactory. Adding insult to injury: the film was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.
