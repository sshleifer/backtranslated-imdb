Back in the day, I remembered seeing stupid comics from Nintendo Power that had the same illustrations as this show ... and then, I was told that this show was a TV show near me! I was not fanatic, but curious ... I was curious to see how bad this show was going to be. My friends all said that this show had no real meaning and that it was too stupid for heterosexuals like me to like it (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate the way so many fanboys drool against Tiff, it's sad. I also hate the way they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his ordinary name is) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad movement, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing more than a losing adviser to King Dedede (who sucks heavily on this show) and I hate the face of this company that continues to provide Dedede with these terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid that I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I started to hate Kirby even more, because it was obvious that Nintendo was just trying to give it some popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for freshness, and Kirby will never be a tiny cup of cream of cheerfulness. NUF said !!!
