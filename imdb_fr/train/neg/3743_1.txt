In the first episode, Jared Diamond pointed out that other peoples of the world did not have animals to domesticate but that Europeans did, which is why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then, in the third episode, he says that when the Europeans from South Africa went too far from the north, they met Zulus and other tribes who were raising cattle and planted crops *. So, what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements if they had the essential elements that the author affirms the need to succeed? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims sprouts in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 indigenous warriors and 400 non-military South Africans, defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single victim * in either case, then you must conclude that the germs are not not relevant. With or without germs, we would succeed. <br /> <br /> According to him, malaria has prevented Europeans from colonizing the north of the country, killing "thousands" of Europeans without touching Africans. (I'd like to know the actual numbers but he does not say.) Then, in the end, he says that today, malaria kills thousands of Africans and that's why they can not catch us. So who is it, Jared? Did Malaria help Africans by arresting Europeans or injuring them? And how is Europe doing well despite the massive plagues of our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reasons why Europeans have succeeded are due to bad luck. Sometimes, when the evidence threatens to crush his lame theories, he is reluctant to admit that the Europeans may have succeeded because they worked there. It's sad to watch this obvious reality of obvious neo-Marxist contortions trying to prove its point.
