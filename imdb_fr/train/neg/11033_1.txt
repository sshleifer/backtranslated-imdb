The last rumor that circulates is that Vh1 starts making calls for I Love New York 3 in the middle of 2008. Does this mean that Budah or New York are getting rid of New York or does that mean that the winner is rejected? I know that Flavor of Love is in its third season, so now, with a Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3, will there be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that Chance will be back for the 3rd season of I Love New York !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York would be specially featured in Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> Let's hope this has not been too painful for the end of I Love New York 2 ... I have just said the last rumor.
