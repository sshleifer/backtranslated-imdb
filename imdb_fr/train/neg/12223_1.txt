I remember when this trash was out, all the newspapers yelled that it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film shot. Well, it would not have taken so many years; the room was only opened in 1975, eight years earlier. That made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably should have played in the film, but NOOOOO ... the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO MAKE HIS WAY. AND WITH MUSIC WITHOUT LESS! This film is a total disaster from beginning to end. On one hand, Barbra was FORTY YEARS when she did it and she looked at it every minute. It was impossible for anyone to swallow it so young girl eager to study the Torah. And then when she disguises herself as a boy, it becomes campy. I have the impression that Streisand could not bear not being attractive so she played with makeup. she is prettier as a boy than as a girl. And as if that were not enough, she mingles with both her classmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is the shooting of her naked back) AND her fianc√©e (Amy Irving, who does her sleepwalking routine) usual, schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she does). Yentl even goes to marry the girl; I would not even bother to mention the scene of the "wedding night". <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Nine songs totally forgotten, all sung by Streisand via a voice-over (presumably like a look in his mind), and each as intrusive and irritating as nails on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> I will not say that Streisand shows no glimmer of hope as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (Patinkin's back in particular) and she has a sense of balance. The problem with this film is that it will not come out. I did not believe her for a second in the lead role; she should never have added the songs, and besides all the disorder lasts two hours and fifteen minutes. I was tired of all that messy mess after forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> Ugly, awful, awful.
