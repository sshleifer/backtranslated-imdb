It was a cute movie until the end. The end was simply a more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who finally gave up his power and control over the relationship with her. It was no coincidence that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel as they walked away at the end, after he had begged her to beg her and beg her to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible for all men and control their relationship with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.
