That's the only thing I can say positive about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I have never been there and I have never seen the city so beautiful. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This film is moving at a rate that it hopes you will not notice the irrelevance of the real world. People who run and shoot guns without consequence. For example, there is a shootout in the home of Rob Lowe's character - two cars were stolen, yet the police did not show up until much later in the film. A murder for money has never seemed so improbable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this film should be the recipient of one of the countless stray bullets in the film. Many actors in this film are so much better than that. I check the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the writers' strike, but alas it was not. This movie is currently spinning on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to chat over Lowe, there is no reason to watch it.
