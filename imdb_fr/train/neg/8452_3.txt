This is the first time I comment on a film because I feel that if the right person reads it, they may wake up and do something. In recent months, ABC Family has begun broadcasting a new movie format. I saw the last three and enjoyed them. They got involved and went around. My wife loves these movies. I could not wait to see "See Jane Date". The trailers looked and sounded good. Unfortunately, this is a film where the book must be light years away from the effort of the writers and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as a lift ride in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. It worked against that. I work in the film and television sector. I like to be entertained. This is an example where I kept thinking that it could get worse. The scenario had lines from another decade and I know these women can play but this movie would not tell. To add to the overall experience, the end let me shake my head. A tip for Disney, ABC, ABC Family and producers: Do not hire the composer or music supervisor to make one of your future movies. They have lost touch and need to understand what the word "contemporary", "today" and "actual" means when we describe a romantic comedy. There is a world before you. On the whole, the people of Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family were very disappointed.
