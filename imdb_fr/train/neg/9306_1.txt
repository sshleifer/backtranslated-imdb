This film is the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen. To begin, I would like to say that the front page of this film is certainly misleading. If you think you are seeing a really scary horror movie with a monster clown, you are so wrong. In fact, the faces of the killers do not even look like the cover, but an image they had to find on Google and that seemed to him very cool. Speaking of things that they found and found that cool, there's a scene in this movie where some gang members are looking for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen goes to a scene where there is a deer mother who feeds her childhood in a ray of sunshine ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How does this relate to the dark woods in which they roam? I bought this movie from a man on a market in the hope that it would be entertaining. If it was not horror, at least it would be funny, no? FALSE! The next day, I gave it to my co-worker, getting rid of the plague called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> In summary, do not watch this movie !!!
