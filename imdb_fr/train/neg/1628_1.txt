Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems to really want to be something important. The tragic truth is that, at all levels, it is so devoid of value that one can not help laughing. In desperation for the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, he follows a couple of days in the desert ... they walk on a shady path, while pontificating like an American spectator. Berkeley Caf√© Clatch. Almost every tarradiddle dialogue line delivered here is terribly bad ("I feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this grenade ... but is it so beautiful?") After what seems to be an eternity of absolutely nothing happening (well ... OK ... we are treated to nudity and a scene of tepid sex), there is finally a VERY anticlimactic confrontation involving a couple of veterans of Nam who make the scene of nature and play some pretty folk ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing interesting or interesting is happening IN THIS FILM. I thought Larry Buchanan's picture "Strawberries Need Rain" was a weak example of a tribute to Bergman. "Golden Apples" is just as bad, but the incessant verbiage he presents makes it horribly awful. 1/10
