European Vacation (aka National Vacation of European Lampoon) is the lowest of the holiday films (the first and third best films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time the script is assigned to them with a weaker dialogue. This causes rhythm stimulation, with not very funny jokes at all. To be more specific, what really hurts this film is the fact that the "jokes" are stuck together in a scenario pav√©), rather than serve a central plot like the other 3 films of Vacation. Oh, they can not win them all. 4 out of 10
