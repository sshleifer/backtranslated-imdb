The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" was filmed again and broadcast to us in the United States via Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who has to watch the body of a witch with only his faith. to protect it. Highly developed and installed in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (houses, clothes and furniture are fake despite English signs), it is a strange film that does not really work. Part of it is the strange setting that tries hard to be from the American hinterland, but this is clearly not the case. There are also strange moments, deliberately oblique, in which the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest shortly after. I do not know why they did this, even after watching the filming of the DVD) The other problem is the dubbing which is more than terrible. It's done in such a way that everyone talks when their lips are not filmed - or if they are, the voices do not even match the shreds. I do not know if it's his fault at Faith Films or the producers who made the film in the hope of flowing to the West (revealed in the filming of the film). <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I said, there are all kinds of technical problems that make it a curious curio. Despite very good horror images, the movie never works like a horror movie. As a film to engender faith, he is far too confused in this story for anyone who feels closer to God to feel better. <br /> <br /> If the choice was made, I would give it a pass, even at an exceptional price. My advice would be to find the 1960s version of the Viy tale that will bring both chills and an understanding of belief in a god.
