This film is actually worse than most movies I have ever experienced, and I have suffered a lot. Absolute absurdity. It is a terrible and forced dialogue; unnecessary conspiracy developments; really "phantasmagorical" scenes, more like a high school catch-up project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes featuring such women (forget what you know about virgins, especially those with fake, twisted breasts); murmurs, difficult to understand the speech of some of the characters; and they actually used Outer Space's Killer Klowns masks during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving advantage, because this movie was pretty funny, but it's not. Veden Fell is the meanest villain in the film's history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this one a miss.
