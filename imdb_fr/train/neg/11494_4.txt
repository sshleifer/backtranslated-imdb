Richard Dix is ​​a big industrialist, not very nice, who almost got fooled. If he takes the holidays that his doctors suggest, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, it will probably be better if it ignores the WHISTLER VOICE. <br /> <br /> This entry directed by William Castle presents great moments (the introduction and portrait of the life of Richard Dix through news to the Citizen Kane), and some intriguing intrigues in the last rolls . Ten's performance is generally very good. But, unfortunately, the righteous does not quite work because we do not end up buying the characters behave as they do. In addition, the film moves from a dark (and fascinating) beginning to an almost gay movie of the '30s, as a middle section (full of sympathetic urban ethnic types that make fun of not being rich), to return to a plot black complex for the past 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> It's a decent movie - to see - that deserves to be seen - but it took a little more time to establish a couple of characters and a female star capable of responding to her role .
