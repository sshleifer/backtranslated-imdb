After watching this film, read the summary on the back of the DVD, and then rethink the film itself ... I became a little dizzy. I thought I might have fallen asleep and dreamed that I was a baby with Down's Syndrome waltzing in an infinite forest where people drove 11 miles an hour and stopped for nothing. other than tasteless and occasional lesbianism. Where (zombies?) Come out of nowhere and (vampires?) Who (seduce?) Pure-hearted citizens on the road to save the world. Neither zombie nor vampire meet in particular. The only fight I remember was to remove the pants of this walrus Bonny Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All! It may be because we were watching it on the big screen and we were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but it actually made it more entertaining ... In conclusion, my thesis of thought has more continuity, conspiracy, character development, material antagonism, and then acting the entire film. Bloodrayne looks like Citizen F *** ING KANE
