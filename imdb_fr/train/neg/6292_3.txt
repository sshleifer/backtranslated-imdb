I wonder how much this film really has to do with the movie "Bachelor Party" of 1984, with Tom Hanks. Is this film even an official sequel? This film is missing in all departments and it is obviously best not to watch it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is just not good enough or funny. It is based primarily on the stereotyped evaluations of the character, rather than the film that actually presents some good and original fun moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are also very few stories present and the bare breast of the film compared to the script pages. You are still waiting for things to start at last. There's a main plot in the plot somewhere, but this one is terribly unoriginal and is executed so badly in the film that it gives the impression that it's something non-existent. I suppose there is even a message and a moral story somewhere in the film but it's again so terribly unoriginal and badly done in the movie that it just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's basically a typical teen comedy, with lots of sexual jokes and nudity, without the main characters of adolescence, which makes the story more sad and tasteless. The film makes really bad jokes, which are badly placed for any type of movie. <br /> <br /> I regret never having seen this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
