This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever produced. I was a child when it came out and I always thought it was devil, even though I loved the original drawing. <br /> <br /> There is this scene that I remember when the mafia monkey guy explains to his servants what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate the show for including a female turtle, but that did not bother me. So much so that I did not even remember her until I read about the series recently. Overall, it's sadly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The only thing that goes well is the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it ... Nananana Ninja ...
