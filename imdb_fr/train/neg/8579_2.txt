I'm afraid this one is pretty awful, despite several good performances and a generally competent direction to play the camera. This is a first and last attempt of author-director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of the Canadian program to promote local film production. While the program encourages laudable efforts such as "New Waterford Girl", it opens the door to unskilled novices like Lyu, who do not have to aggressively present this project, but who have been praised without adequate review. their scenario or their references. <br /> <br /> The low budget does not bother you, because the design of the shabby production, the poor lighting, the mediocre sound and the selection of dismal documentary shots are coherent with the subject treated; workers in Canadian massage parlors. But dialogue and conspiracy do not give the actors something to work with, the editor much to assemble, nor to a spectator a mental challenge other than the suspension of disbelief. When your story is so simplistic, the last thing you need is a confusing narration technique; Even if nothing happens, the film is difficult to follow and impossible to define from the point of view. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is a few centimeters shorter than that described in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her weird standard airhead; as always she is nice but here she is little else. Cindy from Kira Clavell is a nice surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role that makes sense, Bara, Street, Betty, Tara Spencer-Nairn, cancels more than her excellent performance in "New Waterford Girl". Its superficial performance in "Rub and Tug" should limit any tendency to search for other films in which it appeared; unless you need more confirmation of the talent of the director of "Waterford" Alan Moyle to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that the reptilian brain of Lyu can not grasp concepts such as the intricacy of the plot, so the need to insert a lazy and lame device "deus ex machina" is hardly a surprise. Nevertheless, it could be worse, the apathetic story anyway has so little internal logic that the unlikely ending is not as painful as it normally would be. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
