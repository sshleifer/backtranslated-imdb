I read Rice's novel with interest and fell in love with her characters and her heartbreaking story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply guided by this disastrous adaptation. The cast was based solely on physical appearance and not on acting talent (with the exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither fair-haired nor able to get out of a wet paper bag). The embarrassing and clumsy attempts of distribution to affect a French accent were hilarious, but not entertaining. I found myself wincing between these confused and melodramatic guts and I was surprised to have finished it. <br /> <br /> A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one.
