The central theme of this film seems to be confusion, because the relationships, the scenery, the acting and the social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element, and lacks his usual clarity, direction, and flawless intensity. To make matters worse, the name of his character is "Che", and we are told (directly, by the narrator) though in the movie that he is not "this" Che, just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and, once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation goes to America. So cliche. Other critics explain how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a boy's family. However, the political position of the director is at best cloudy, and we never know exactly who is responsible for this bloodbath. So, they lost their property (acquired by the profits of the game) - so what? Refusing to take a political stance by making a film about the Cuban Revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the film was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to watch here, it would be great if we could determine who is who - we are all introduced to them at the beginning - an inexpensive way to clarify relationships throughout the film! The acting game was generally shallow, wooden and amazing, the timing was out of sync. "Special" visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character as a Greek choir - strictly free, intellectually ostentatious and systematically misplaced. I only watched the entire movie because I was waiting for clarity or for a moment. It never happened.
