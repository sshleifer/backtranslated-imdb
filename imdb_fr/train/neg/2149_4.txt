Well, the big slot machine has already succeeded! Disney very cleverly takes advantage of morons like me who believe that we must have each video (good or bad) marked with the nickname Disney. Why do I still look forward to these "sequels" that give Don Bluth a bad day an air of Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (already a bad choice!) Does one of Disney's most appealing creations not deserve at least a linear story? Of these three events, only the last reaches the quality of animation and narration that I would expect. The music is atrocious and modern (that is to say in 2 years, it will already be dated) and adds nothing to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original drawing is always popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can not wait for a sequel to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we will have music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, Disney, if you listen, remember that we are not all blind children here. Why not throw a bone or two to fans who have enough time to know the difference between crafts and shit?
