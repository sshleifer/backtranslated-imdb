Personally, even though I am able to enjoy very good movies, I also have a strange ability to appreciate some of the craziest shit. You know, those moments when you just want to sit down and watch a horrible action movie cutting a cookie to kill time. This is the only movie I can remember that stopped in the middle, and I have absolutely NO intention to finish it. The plot was so artificial and predictable that I called what would be the next scene easily (and I'm usually not very good at it). The actors were horrible, I saw better playing in college plays. Even the scenes were bad, everything was bad. <br /> <br /> This film is like a parody that has forgotten the funny.
