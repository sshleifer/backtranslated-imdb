WOW! Pretty terrible things. The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and joins art director Joseph Losey for this remarkably poorly designed Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor embodies a wealthy dying widow who is holding on to her servants on an island where she dictates very strongly her memories to an incredibly patient secretary. When the Burton villain introduces himself as a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes that his time is up. Playful to the extreme - it's hard to tell if Taylor and Burton are doing badly or if Williams' intention was to make their characters so unattractive. If so, the acting is awesome! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor makes her scream. She is really awful. The same goes for Noel Coward, Taylor's confidential confidante, the "Sorceress of Capri". <br /> <br /> Presumably, BOOM explains how ephemeral time is and how fast life evolves - two classic Williams themes, but it's so badly managed by Losey that Taylor and Burton do not have it explained to the public during their mostly inanimate monologues, any substance of the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has great photographs --- the camera should have been blurred to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The cast includes Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's hustler and Michael Dunn as the ugly security guard dwarf ... his dogs and make him a number on Burton!
