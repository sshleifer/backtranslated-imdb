This film is so awful that it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At first, the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and without talent, maybe they have been forced to play in this nerdy movie. <br /> <br /> The receptions of the National Forest camera are the only positive things in this film. I should feel ashamed because I paid for this ugly picture. <br /> <br /> If all goes well, no one does not follow or does a similar movie with a scenario as bad :-)
