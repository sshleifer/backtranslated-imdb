this is the first time I write a comment on a film on IMDb. but I had to write it for this one. his 3 hours of unmixed torture. From the beginning, you have the idea that the movie is going to be bad. the game is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in Bhagat Singh) but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but the fear is gone. prashant raj is a non-actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. I do not know why the director took her in this film. the background note is repetitive. somewhere, I felt that ramu was trying to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but that did not work. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH
