Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw the film last January, the film so disgusted me that I walked and talked with my cellphone to my girlfriend during the last half hour of the film. I heard that the DVD was cut by a director. Maybe I'll take a look, but this PG-13 trash movie is a fucking s and the worst kind of s ***. Maybe if the movie had T & A, everything would have gone well. But the gags are void and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
