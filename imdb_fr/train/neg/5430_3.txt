Priyadarshan - Whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy". That's why this man is known or rather known. After giving superb hit comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly derailed with films like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I do not remember. Now, with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would hit our mind after hearing his name would be "torture." <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mix of bad jokes on the toilet, a little dramatic, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two fun scenes, though not spiritual, and second, apart from Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the acting was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them to others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and to the last two idiots mentioned above. The defect of Kunal Khemu was that he was noisy in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandmother looked at first like a ghost, and besides she was not funny at all, but rather silly. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same as the one seen before. Four boys behind girls who need money, but with some twists. There is a "bad guy" who is ridiculously stupid and stupid. And finally, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a full silver tone is just not spiritual. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After about an hour, you are exhausted and want to leave the theater. But as a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate the two and a half hours of the film. The film continues again and again, the same kind of jokes are repeated over and over again and the situations are perennial just in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law has arrived home and starts making fun of everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10
