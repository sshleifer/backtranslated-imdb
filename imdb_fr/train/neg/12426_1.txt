Anyone who thinks that another Home Alone movie would be a good idea should have their head examined ... Even intrigue, different kid, more bad guys (resulting in MORE endless stupidity in the traps). The other two movies were bad enough, and that's where everything goes. People can also watch other movies for the plot, because everything is the same.
