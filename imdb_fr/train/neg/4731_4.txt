An unenthusiastic attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern world, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old, blinkered, flashing cliche. A woman chooses E.P. on the beach and then resumes her life - and he does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is exhausting in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Strive to be the two bosses of Elvis (he is black, you see). Some songs are quite good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a sex comedy looser, more trendy, more trendy, like Elvis, look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal attraction lie down together, there is actually a wooden board between them! Get real. ** from ****
