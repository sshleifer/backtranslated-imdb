"The revolt of the zombies" proves that having the same director to reorganize and recycle an idea does not necessarily cause lightning twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, responsible for the classic horror movie "White Zombie", did this a little bit of garbage a few years later to take advantage of its popularity and even recycle close-ups of the eyes from Lugosi from this previous movie. There was a court battle against the rights holders of the film "White Zombie", who did not want the Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. This word was the only thing that could help this movie because, as everyone knows, bad movies can make a lot more money just by showing the word "Zombie" in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years ago only makes this film uninteresting even more insulting. It seems he has never made another horror movie after this debacle. The zombies here do not seem to be true undead, but simply victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a zombie army controlled by the mind? Prepare to break some eggs, including yours. <br /> <br /> THE PLACE OF THE BLADE: The man falls in love with the intriguing woman who plays with his heart and is engaged with him only to make his friend that she loves jealous It sends the man in a spiral of madness in which he tries to use mind control techniques of zombies to change things to his advantage in order to win a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most obvious plot developments I've ever seen. One would have to be blind or stupid not to see the end come. The acting game is not even good. This film makes the film "The King of Zombies" insensitive to the race (which appeared on the same double bill DVD that I bought) seems to be a masterpiece of atmospheric horror by comparison and reminds us that all Black and white movies are not classics. This makes the extraterrestrial zombie cheese party of sci-fi "Invisible Invaders" a serious drama. It's a big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic that it could probably appeal to many fans of Korean films (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits list the company ironically named Favorite Films. I'm not sure about the favorite movie, but it's obviously an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of: zombies, love movies or classics.
