Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw him twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was a lot of fun. I really like that. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I saw him a few days ago. It was horrible. Really. I do not know why I thought it was funny before but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing even slightly entertaining. It was just stupid. The story was weak. The acting was nothing special. There are excellent actors in this film but the acting is at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that this film is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, usually I do not complain about racism in movies. However, I've seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like "The Shaolin Temple" or the fact that the only black man in "The Street Fighter" is one of the bad guys or ... What Either way, you get the point. There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a film like "The Man of Meteors". Why? I will tell you why. There are no Asians in this film. There are no whites among the good ones. In fact, there is only one white in the whole film and he is the leader of the bad guys. All good guys are African American. Do not get me wrong, I do not care if the good boy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What matters to me is that we can barely see a white person in this film. It's the only movie of its kind I've ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese film, as is the case with 'The Street Fighter', there is no problem - in Japan, most people are Asians . But if there is only one white in an American film, there is a problem: in the United States, most people are white. It's like shooting a Japanese movie with an all-white cast and a single Asian as a villain. Just not real. <br /> <br /> That's all. I give the film the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I had not had fun with it when I was a child.
