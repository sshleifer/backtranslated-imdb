When I saw that IMDb users had rated this movie among the last 250 films, I thought it was too harsh, but I did not know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. . I loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, laughed very little and the jokes were out of date. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the joke will turn around Marlon Wayans, who plays the role of a newly emerged adult dwarf. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond for a gangster. Things go wrong and the dwarf has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To recover the diamond, the dwarf claims to be an abandoned baby left at the doors of unsuspecting couples. Of course, he is taken care of and the drama begins in search of the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film features actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live, such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help the bad story and the jokes that were just not funny. <br /> <br /> Special effects allowing Marlon Wayans to look like a dwarf were acceptable. I mean, it was not 100% believable, but it was good ... nothing great. I only hope the Wayans brothers have put more effort into developing a good joke scenario than trying to consolidate their script with cameos from their famous comic actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Wait for it on the cable or TV. This is really not worth any money.
