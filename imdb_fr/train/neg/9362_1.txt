The plot seemed to sound like a promise. To be honest, I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour in the movie, I had to make a decision. Does this film deserve to be watched until its conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant of a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being pursued by secret government authorities for a man / wolf transplant. It was because the film was badly written, the actor's play lacked emotion and I did not understand the different sequences of dreams with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a pack of dogs and left them in front of the zoo door, the saying "If you can not run with big dogs do not leave the porch" kept getting through my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can assure you that if you dare to look at it, you will be sitting speechless because I was wondering why someone was wasting money, time, energy and effort to make this scandal American cinema.
