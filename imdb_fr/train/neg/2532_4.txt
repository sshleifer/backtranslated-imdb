The cult of personality raised the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc., as kings of B. Because the employees of Crown International were so important, they did not reach the status that they deserve amply. A film like THE VAN may now seem to be a disposable piece of esoteria from Drive-in, but it was a sizeable success on its release (not to mention subsequent reissues as a double-film with other Crown hits) . <br /> <br /> THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's successful strategy to capture the moviegoer's mood when a movie was released. Here it was sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and the craze "Custom Van". As others have noted, it is ironic that the hit song in the movie refers to a Chevrolet when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a Selectman from the city where I was at the time, even stating that these vans were "dens of sin on wheels!" An ideal pub line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is a usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular heads and thin eyebrow hijinks (including support from Danny DeVito). In many ways, it's not much different from the old 60's Beach Party movies, but it's now complete with nudity and addiction. Obviously realized with a budget and a limited schedule, the film continues quite pleasantly with a captivating charm that compensates, according to the current standards, undoubtedly, the point of view of the woman on a PC. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's Wheeled Den. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you must have something hot for those cravings! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
