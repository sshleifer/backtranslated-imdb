The clumsy Griswald wins the grand prize of the TV show "The pig in poke" and fly together to Europe where they manage to cause a stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous and insignificant suites that make money turn, it beats the lot. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was a less than average misadventure in which the unsuitable family had made a nightmarish nightmare "vacation" across the United States. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who Speaks") directs what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" that will bother you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes' scenario (with Rob Klane) is horrible and you wonder why personalities such as Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have bothered themselves for such a ruthless project, as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca have had the feeling to decline the offer. Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to lift the procedure to a level that could be described as entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, as inconceivable as it may seem, "European Vacation" has been successful enough to deserve a second sequel! This surely could not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I have not seen a national Lampoon show that was worth it. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
