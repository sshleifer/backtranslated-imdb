When George C. Scott starred in "Patton", you saw him directing tanks with pumps, firing a revolver at a dive bomber, and blaspheming his superiors and subordinates. . The most action we get from Gregory Peck as "MacArthur", character of the same war of a more questionable achievement, is when he taps on the navigation charts with his finger and raises his famous eyebrow. <br /> <br /> Comparison of Peck's performance with Scott can be unfair. However, the "MacArthur" event was directed by the same producer and scored by the same composer, which parallels the fact that both films begin with the generals addressing the West Point cadets. It's clear to me that filmmakers were looking to emulate this Oscar-winning film a few years ago. But although Peck seems to be the most important role Scott has ever had, he usually appears as a bland in a story that looks less like a drama than an overhaul of MacArthur's career on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> "those who think he is a dangerous demagogue and others who say he is one of the greatest men who ever lived", says a first title. a bit typical of post-Vietnamese sophistry concerning those who led the US Army, much of its time, but what we get here is neither MacArthur, as presented here, does not cause anger and does not inspire what he did in life. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Sargent, who then directed the famous turkey "Jaws The Revenge", performs a painting by numbers work with bland battle montages and obvious use of sets (as when the Chinese attack US forces in Korea), while Hal Barwood's scenario and Matthew Robbins portrays a MacArthur who seems as good-natured as it is bland, too caught in his public image, but never less than suitable. <br /> <br /> Here you see him from to scout from the landing craft to return to the Philippines. You see him speaking to Congress in his speech "Old Soldiers Never Die". For a long time, he sits in a movie theater in Toyko, waiting for North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can move on to the next story, while newsreel footage details Japan's rise to ashes under his enlightened reign. Peck's co-actors, Marj Dusay for his devoted wife ("you are my best soldier") and Nicolas Coaster for a loyal help, burn teary eyes in the direction of the magnificence of their companion but do not arouse any interest in them -Same. <BR /> <br /> Even when he argues with other people, Peck never raises his voice and wins his arguments most of the time with a loud throat. When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the Philippines' recovery, a point of personal pride and tactical concern for MacArthur, MacArthur returns with the following comment: "Earlier, while listening to his plan, I thought I saw our flag down. "No doubt the real Nimitz would have something to say about it, but the film character nods and humbly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The only person in the movie MacArthur seriously disagrees with Harry S. Truman, with whom Ed Flanders does a great job despite a prosthetic nose that makes him look like Toucan Sam. MacArthur's dismissal by Truman should be a dramatic climax, but here it takes place in a quiet conversation, in which Peck plays MacArthur as a real martyr. <br /> <br /> I've never been sold by Peck stands at the top pantheon of stars on the screen; it offers a great presence but lacks complexity even in many of its best-known roles. But it's unfair to leave him here so often, because he has little help in defining MacArthur as anything but boring. Except two scenes, one against the surrender of the Philippines ("He hit Old Glory and put up a bed sheet!") And another where he had a mini-crash while waiting for the American invasion of Inchon and the invasion of the Communists who undermine the White House, Peck really plays the role of Peck here, not the complex character that inspired the famous sobriquet "American Caesar". The real MacArthur could have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.
