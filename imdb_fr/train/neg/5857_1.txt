WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps its biggest fault is not to follow most of the previous Survivor series? There was only one surviving series match. And this match in the Survivor series lasted 45 minutes.

If there is always a Survivor series as bad as this one, I'll
