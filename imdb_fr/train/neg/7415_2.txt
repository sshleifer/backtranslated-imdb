What do you call a horror story without horror and without history? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the film: I feel that the writers never really decided what was really going on in the movie! It's different from knowing it, giving clues to the public and not revealing it completely, but here you have the feeling that the writers do not know it, the characters in the movie do not know it and the public sees that nobody knows it! (Remember "Cube"? Even this movie knew more about himself.) <br /> <br /> I have been consuming a lot of horror movies / horrors of the 80's and this movie certainly has some roots deep in these films. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines again and again. The story does not really develop - it never goes anywhere. Playing B is acceptable in this type of horror film, but there is not much to play in the scenario. We do not care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even any cheesy humor or useless sex. And more importantly - no chills, no chills. <br /> <br /> You only get a few commonly used horror movie items. They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters do not really contribute to the story. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with a minimum of crews and equipment. Oh yes, filmmakers did that - and more - 20 years ago! I felt the embarrassment shared by the audience at the end of the film. Too bad really.
