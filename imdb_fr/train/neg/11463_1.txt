This is just a response to Yahoo saying that this movie is more realistic than the classic, defining the genre MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, deer, large whites (and other species of shark, bull, black tip, oceanic white tip, tiger) are known to populate areas with easy prey. Humans do not often appear on this menu, okay, but the shark in the movie has been repeatedly reported to behave abnormally. It's not like it never happened. The chances of a killer whale destroying almost a whole city, to select a human enemy, to sink several dozen thick-shelled fishing boats and to know when some people, all the friends of this "enemy", are close enough to the water to make it reach, are so thin that they are laughable. A bit like this shit of knock-off Jaws. Ridiculous. Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew boats, underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce (if you do not know it, look for it) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca (hey, that's the name of the flagrant scam we're talking about!), Like he would weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but it's not necessary. Jaws is amazing (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca it's shit (Jaws' BLATANT scam, ugly writing, abominable effects, the most ridiculous plot on this side of a movie Olson Twins). You do not need a master from Columbia University to see that. Watch better movies
