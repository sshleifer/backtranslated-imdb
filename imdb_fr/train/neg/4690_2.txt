This British film is really awful, and it's hard to imagine that Glenn Ford is involved, even though he's practically sleepwalking. The idea of ​​a bomb in a train looks good ... but it turns out that this train is parked for the majority of the film! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, which poses no danger to anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in a movie class to show how NOT to make a suspense movie. Real suspense is generated by telling the audience things the characters do not know, a fact apparently unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train is actually two bombs, but we are led to believe that there is only one. After defusing the first bomb, it seems like there is no reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute, the villain, who apparently has no motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. We are not sure WHEN the bombs will explode, so we do not have a classic "ticking bomb" tension sequence. You spend 10 good minutes or more watching Glenn Ford's French woman thinking about leaving him and wondering where he is. Her character is so boring that we do not care if she's reconciled with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters have no personality and none of them have a problem. It's only 72 minutes, but it's been a long time because it's tedious and boring. Do not waste your time.
