This movie was so bad that I could not believe I was watching it. The staging, the editing, the production and the scenario all seemed to have been entrusted to college students who do not know much about cinema. No narrative flow made sense. Great emotional moments and strong moments (like at the very beginning between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like those evoked at the very beginning) come out of nowhere completely and are not configured as they would have been from more elegant way and actually made a movie. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, which makes any connection with them difficult. The game of actors, surprisingly, is not totally bad, but the terrible writing cancels the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly epic western, and unfortunately minimizes the fascinating (true) story he is trying to tell. I have read many critics who defend the film as important to Australians because of its subject. All of this is very good, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon, the film does not have to be good. Nobody says that the subject is not good, just the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event for the Americans, but that does not mean that I will defend the film and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure everywhere, although Heath and Orlando are nice to watch.
