Flat characters that you do not like and never worry about. Incisive dialogue on the premises. No twists (they think they have one, but if you do not understand it after about 40 minutes, you're not too bright). Many actors known in roles and performances that, fortunately for all participants, will be forgotten from the end credits. <br /> <br /> It does not bother me that movies are slow, but they have already been going somewhere. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The plot is not what makes this film a movie directly on DVD, it is a convenient excuse to try to generate a false controversy. <br /> <At the time of writing 37 (!) Ten (10) evaluations must come from people involved in the production.
