If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other distraction. The massive talent is totally wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", the blame falling squarely on the screenplay. My neighbor's holiday movies are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to use a cast of veterans with a good script, check out "The Crew". There is really no redeeming factor here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow script misleads the audience by essentially giving the actors no way to work. - MERK
