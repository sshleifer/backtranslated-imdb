Many people see this as a classic, but I have obviously missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas, in the early '50s is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas, in the early' 50s will also be boring! What do so many people see in this? Once Anarene's last photo shoot is over, there will be really nothing left to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) highlights this point at the end of the film. But even before closing, there is not much to do, so everything revolves around sex. High school students develop plans to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the city's equally bored adults. You see, they do not have much to do either - apart from having sex (sometimes between them and sometimes with bored teens) or complaining about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that, I thought, was going to add something dramatic to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies suddenly, but nothing really happens because of this, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) leave, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added something dramatic to the film came to an end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really highlights the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, while men look at the body in debate. for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is supposed to show how gray the city is, but the only thing that seems interesting to me is the first look at actors such as Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (By the way, it was terrifying to see how Quaid - in 1971 - actually looked like his Cousin Eddie character in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
