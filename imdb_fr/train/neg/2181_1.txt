I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old, fun B movies to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and visibly aimed at men who like to look at fat women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that she completely lost interest in me. He seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood movies - bottom of the barrel.
