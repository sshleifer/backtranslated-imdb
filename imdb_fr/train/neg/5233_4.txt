Quite horrible but observable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you lived the 80s). Vietnam veterinarians fight together as friends against injustice in the United States A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time flies, the soldiers return home and years later, a friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, the friend is dead and his father has problems. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely terrifying meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father's small shop against the local "protection gang" despite his wheelchair of the war. Desperate, the father speaks to Sarge, the head of Joey's old Vietnamese unit, when Sarge arrives at the funeral. <br /> <br /> The creaky wheel takes grease and the old gang rolls. for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drives me crazy is that Sarge does not stop haranguing his men about planning and how good they are in what they do. when they plan in advance. But in Vietnam, Joey would not have been put in a wheelchair by a shot if the unit had not decoyed! Then, when things are going really well in the city as they fight the gangs, they do it again. For no reason, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh !!!! I lift my hands in disgust. Madness! <br /> <br /> There is also a moment of mistrust when all the members of the unit present make sure to try the heroine they seized in the gang to make sure it's Well the case. Each of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep watching, I guess. The movie is not too horrible to watch, but it's teasing. There are all those culminating moments where nothing really happens. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's deadly battle and the gang brutally spreading an innocent teddy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I imagine that the main problem with this film is that I feel disappointed. Even the puzzling secondary intrigues with "mystery assistants" and their strangely contradictory motivations were not enough to save him in the end. But one day, maybe everything will be fine and they will do a sequel. Ha ha ha ha !!!
