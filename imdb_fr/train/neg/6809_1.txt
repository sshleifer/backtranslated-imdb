A Stinko of a film staging a faded plot and, to be nice, acting of a caliber inferior to Oscar. But for me, the worst defect was the misrepresentation of a jet plane, and in particular a 747. Some of the major mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. No flight engineer (nor 2. Identity of the F-16 interceptors as F-15 (no resolution of any kind) such a compartment existed, placing such a mass at the rear would make the aircraft impossible to fly. 4. Hollow-point bullets that "will not damage the aircraft." 5. The entire landing procedure was so hard that I wanted SR-71 (of all planes) with a seal hatch underneath. pressure 7. Open a cabin door to the outside - in the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> Ah, it's crazy, it was a really ugly movie. year.
