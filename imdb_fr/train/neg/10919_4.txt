Bollywood fans hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high esteem, but I think it's overestimated. Manmohan Desai has already collaborated on films like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie. I saw them all that I liked. So I waited a lot before looking at Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main complaint about Mard is that I feel that Amar Akbar Anthony, part two, may have run out of ideas after using this formula for years and years. 1. First, some members of the cast are taken back from AAA, for example the police inspector who evokes Amar, the Muslim who raises Akbar, Nirupa Roy and some others. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses sight, in Mard she loses her voice. 3. In AAA, there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba). In Mard, we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. After seeing AAA over 1000 times, I noticed it right away. <br /> <br /> My other criticisms are that some situations seem ridiculous, the real Manmohan Desai let you leave your brain at the door like movies but with Mard I thought he was going too far. My last complaint is that compared to the songs of Manmohan Desai's previous films, I found the songs rather disappointing. I know he has a lot of fans who swear by that, but I did not like him at all. In fact, it hurts me to write this review because I am a big fan and I love his films since I was a child.
