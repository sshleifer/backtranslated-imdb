I know that movies are not necessarily meant to reflect reality, but it has pissed me off. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mother" has already been done many times (and usually better) and much of the rest of the plot is also far-fetched. The acting was not horrible but nothing extraordinary. <br /> <br /> A highlight: I am a long-time fan of the General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by GH's former regular Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can forget the factitious psychoanalytic part, in the same way that a person has to suspend the reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie could be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have spent my time watching it.
