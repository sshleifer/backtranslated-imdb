Power rangers, the debut television show of the 1990s, must be the most useless and ridiculous TV show ever created. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this show anyway, aside from selling plastic nonsense to kids? Be that as it may, this show is not interesting in itself. <br /> <br /> Look at costumes that look like spandex gone awry. <br /> <br /> Mullet-style hair, curls The fashions of the early '90s seem completely ridiculous nowadays. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
