The film lacks style, I mean original style. everything seems to have been copied, including actions, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialogues, etc. etc. he begins to fall from a hill with the number MH ****. It was one of the many goof-ups of the movie :) Something good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in a bikini. For Akshay fans, his dialogues and his action stunts. That's all. nothing else. So watch him at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. The director is already crazy and the actors, I pity them.
