Before continuing, I must admit that I am a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, that's what attracted me to the beginning. Anyway, I probably would have bought him by being such a big fan of horror and having enjoyed the first title of the Vampires. <br /> <br /> But it's not so good. Even Jon could not save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it's just not scary. Aside from Jon's character, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters leaves an impression and we can not care whether they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / addict woman. The vampire woman is just not scary or sexy. On the contrary, she looks like a 14-year-old anorexic girl, no wonder she's so desperate to have blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is "too bright". There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first Vampires in New Mexico were not really twilights, but they still managed to be dark and urgent when needed. This film has no tension like this. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants the Berzier cross to be able to walk in broad daylight. However, the story has less cool aspects this time around. There is no harm in knowing that it is the master of any master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You do not really care who or what it is. There is no army of masters. Instead, it hides in an old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction than a terrifying temple. <br /> <br /> You are really there. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. A real disappointment for me personally.
