When I first saw a small scene in some ads, I thought the show would be fun to watch. The little robot looks pretty cute. The style of animation seems rather familiar to some classical shows. Before the broadcast of the show, I studied some sources. There, I became a little dismayed. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are appropriately expressed, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much better if it had been described by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is not really bad. But the way Robotboy is described inappropriately is my only criticism. So, I do not look very much.
