How, in the name of all that is sacred, has this film ever been distributed? It looks like the shot was fired at someone's cell phone and the scenario of a screaming victim is growing. They shout literally during the 90 minutes of the film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no character and not much acting. Just screaming and even more screaming. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and I walked the track quickly to see if anything was happening. That's not the case - except to scream, of course. Curiously enough, the fact of traveling in fast forward reveals another problem: there is no camera work to speak of. Each shot looks like a shot on a middle distance, an angle, dull, dull, dull. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, it's good. It's just bad.
