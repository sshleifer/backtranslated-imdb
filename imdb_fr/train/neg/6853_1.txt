Another Z-grade trash quickie from prolific Albert Pyun. The 13-inch policeman resembling Tim Thomerson's Clint Eastwood in space pursues an ugly flying head (!) On Earth and gets involved in a gang war in the South Bronx! Mercifully short, but terrifying, with the most cheesy effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should also have fired the continuity manager: note how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappear every second. It's ridiculously bad, but that's why we're watching these movies, are not we? Suite'Dollman vs. Demonic toys would be even worse, if that's possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
