I can not say that this is the worst film of all time, but personally, I think it this way, because when it was released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough for my girlfriend to insist that we were going to see him. In fact, STOOD IN LINE allows you to get tickets and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember, where the audience started giggling at one point and basically laughed at the movie all throughout the film. Once we have reached the infamous (and endless) scene of the snake fight, I think everyone has given up. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can concede is the lush filming. Oh, and there are Bo's breasts too, although his acting is so wooden that nudity is not erotic and does not deserve more than a Playboy image. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this film lies between that of Bo's terrible play and horrible direction of her husband. The fight against snakes must be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those movies that is bad enough, it may be worth watching at the level of unintentional humor. Certainly the worst movie I have ever paid to see.
