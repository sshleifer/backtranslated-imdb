It was the most badly played movie I have ever seen in my life. Not really. I am not joking. All "based on a true story / historical references" aside, there is no excuse for such acting. It's a shame because, as others have already pointed out, the sets and costumes were excellent. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical of "Asian style" music, although I could not know where the "modern" was. A love song came when Fernando was lying in bed thinking about Maria. I do not know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones had been transported in the 1500s. <br /> <br /> The Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic that ketchup thrown during Kwik-n-EZ combat scenes. <br /> <br /> But the acting game. Oh, so painfully sad. The lines were like a bad junior game. If Gary Stretch had put on a potato suit for the 4H County Fair, he might have been more credible. Towards the end, he looked more like a thug from Little Italy Street. Sometimes I almost expected him to shout "Adrian!" or even "Do you want a piece of me ?!" <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen says to her lover (after pampering) "I'm going to have a baby." He answers "A child?" I was expecting her to answer "No, moron, a chair leg!
