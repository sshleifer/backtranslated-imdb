Well ... I was going to wait until it came out on video to see it, and I wish I had it, I actually grabbed the horror movie 2 on the cable the other day, and that made me want more and more, what I got was AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean, if you like Airplane or any other Leslie Nielsen vehicle, you'll probably be in paradise, but if you're used to the WAYANS COMEDY usual, you will be disappointed, there would have been a lot more candy for the eyes in this one that will keep the young teenagers asleep happy happy hormones, which probably explains why it was sold at the box office the first week of his exit. I loved scary movie 2 ten times more than this fodder, and the first part 5 times more. Odd that the best of 3 is part 2, but again, I always liked Halloween 2, better than the original too ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie must be the way foreigners say goodbye. But it was not worth the $ 11 I spent to catch a morning with my fiance. Save money and catch Part 2 on the cable again until it's released on videotape, then rent it, do not buy it.
