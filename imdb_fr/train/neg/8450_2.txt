What happens to ITV Drama. First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television drama I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Parents" is a disaster from start to finish. Anyone who is responsible for ordering this drivel should receive P45 by special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most dramas / thrillers, it is necessary to suspend certain levels of belief so that the parcel line can develop, but "Perfect Parents" took this to a new level, I so much belief at the end of this nonsense that I felt like I was force-fed with a truck of "magic mushrooms", it was as if the writers had decided to try to create a " Drama by the number "involving serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia, the only problem was the one that the great Eric Morecambe said when playing the piano:" I play all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order. " For your next script, I suggest you read a few more books on script development than "Writing scripts for dummies". <br /> <br /> Because of the ridiculous scenario and the total lack of tension in the direction, the acting was appropriately discreet, not the fault of the actors because the distribution was top. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this dramatic drama give instructions to their agents the next time the postman tries to deliver a script from ITV's drama department, make sure the mailbox is closed !!
