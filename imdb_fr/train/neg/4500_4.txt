This movie is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is the type of American European who sneers. But there are those, and not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do not care about the French; and Xavier's character is not going to influence them. <br /> <br /> Consider his stereotyped attributes of French: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, undernourished appearance, check despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of the cuisine. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). A lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact that he's supposed to be a wealthy stockbroker, he seems to have put it in a ten-hour work week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful woman, check. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Wrong interpretation of wedding wishes. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). Big sex ego, who says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy him dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Whether Mo is an idiot or not, she has no reason to crack for this small European twit, if not what the script dictates. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Like other male critics, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's cute and small body. I will give four stars to the film. two of them are for that.
