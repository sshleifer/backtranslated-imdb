Tourists travel to Ireland for a school trip and learn more about druids. What they encounter is a horrible story of cannibal killers. <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up Evil Breed, it would be a low-grade gore festival. The film mixes Dead Alive, Dead Evil, Wrong Turn All in One. It's just a shame that the movie has so many inconsistencies to keep that it loses more "fun" than one would have to watch it. The movie has a lot of random "horror" nudity ... although the movie features four porn stars, or four, then there could have been many more. Race also has a good amount of gore. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a horrible beginning, with a laughable dialogue and a horrible acting game. It's a given in a horror movie right at the video, but it takes the cake. I can not really know who the main character is, because the woman who "lives" at the end does not really figure in the movie. Speaking of the end, this must be one of the most random and dummy endings in the film's history. It does not make sense with the rest of the movie and totally changes his vision of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to see this film to believe it, because there are very beautiful scenes of death. There are two scenes of death that come to mind, one in which the killer tears the intestines of a woman naked by the chest ... yes, his chest, do not ask me. The other identifier when the guy had his bowels, again, was ripped through his asshole. Does that kill the guy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines. These scenes remind me of Dead-Alive so much, with the good mood in each. I also had the feeling of Evil Dead, with the useless mentions of horror movies and Sam Raimi. With Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately; get in there. <br /> <br /> Although gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film. When the teacher gets up from her bed and down the stairs, her steps are so strong and strong that she seems to be wearing boots. Distracting indeed. As well as continuity in the movie, with only one inbred killer? As well as which character dies when. I could not tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I do not remember. Besides the naked chick at random with a dead baby hanging from his body and still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The horrible editing is also embarrassing, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. It had a bad start and improved, but the end brings the film back to a horrible level. If there were perhaps better production values ​​and more confidence in this film, it would not have been horribly shot to death. Stay away from this film unless you are satisfied with the horrible film with a reasonable budget.
