I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I felt ripped off, but then I started to think about it and I should be grateful. I found a Holy Grail, a real touchstone for bad cinema. If you think that the first dramatic shots of an empty stadium get confused with Evel's awkward address monologue, wait for the opening credits to spill over to the driver. The script seems to have been pasted from clippings and ESL manuals. But ..... I can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely no connection with what he's saying, the only internal monologue I can detect is "this so I bet they think I'm cute, really cute!" It's an epiphany! I now know how serious that can become.
