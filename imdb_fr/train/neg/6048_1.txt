Even duller, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say it according to IMDb guidelines). THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences, to complicate the conventional view of the detective of the American police, even if this attempt was tainted by the ambivalence of Friedkin, its American character and its general indirection. The (relative) art boom of the 1960s (especially with the new wave) allowed for a considerable influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This has brought a new vigor and complexity to a tired medium and, in the best of them (eg, BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorcese), to a new subversion of the practice received. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its hard-to-distance style and anti-detective silhouette. TWO is the reaffirmation by Hollywood's old right of American values. <br /> <br /> This is in the very boring dialectic of the film between America and France. For example, TWO is shot down like a French policeman of the 70s. It is of course the French who insisted on the greatness of American films when they were ignored at home, which, in a sense, is a claim, a warning against the Gaulish presumption. This is seen in the diagram of the two films. CONNECTION to French gangsters invading New York, the French style suffocating the American thriller - this leads to the dissolution of the detective and the irresolution of the plot - the villain escaped. <br /> <br /> America is back in France with American thriller values ​​imposed on the indigenous genre - the power of the detective is reaffirmed and the conventional resolution reached. This is even more dramatic in Doyle's relationship with French inspector Barthelmy, whose main influence must be dispelled before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> TWO seems to follow the original by undermining his detective hero. From the beginning, Doyle's importance is diminished at every turn. Despite the end of CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is American on a foreign land and his inability to control language or customs means he can not dominate the plot. He even misread the police signs, confusing an informant with a criminal and causing him to be killed. <br /> <br /> The power of a detective comes from his power as a subject to see and interpret, but Doyle spends much of the film being watched, controlled, in the form of an object, of a body (literally in the scenes after being dropped by Charnier) to see and interpret. In CONNECTION, he initiated the action, pursuing the criminals, forcing the plot; He is here passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, a drug addict, a dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power is symbolized predictably by the loss of its firearm, and the film follows a depressing scenario. Oedipal trajectory familiar. In the heroin sequences, he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like his son. His drug state is like a return to the womb, deprived of the pressure of adults. His watch reinforces the timeless state of this doubly significant state for a man whose career depends on timing and precision. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective. To avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother. who dissolves his unified identity, and kills the father (Charnier) so that he can assume his accepted male role in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among the academics of the 70s (ironically inspired by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a film so literally filled with it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tended to minimize Doyle, the style of the film would not do it. Friedkin has distanced us from his hero by refusing the empathy or motivation of the character, focusing on the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in a long dark plane, it is made understandable and comprehensible for the viewer with the traditional devices - shots from the point of view, close-ups, chained shots, etc. <br /> TWO is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. In this case, the plot is subordinated to the acting, which is the usual Hackman show. The scenes of cold turkey, despite their boredom, are not uncomfortable. We are allowed to share rather than coldly observe; It is a much less embarrassing experience. The scenes are also crossed by a widespread male sentimentality, which is very American. <br /> <br /> While CONNECTION tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, TWO does the opposite. Melville's SAMOURAI staged a gangster that launched the film as a whole, powerful, outside of language, and planned its eventual disintegration. TWO begins with a disintegrated character, obtained in part by its inability to speak, whose dominance begins when it leaves language; the final action sequences are largely wordless. <br /> <br /> In the film, the place and the language are important because they repaired and undermined the detective, but he regained his power (figured in the return of his weapon and the cathartic fire of the primitive site of vulnerability, the tower where Charnier held it), the Marseille cadre loses its importance, and the mythical impasse, which could take place anywhere, takes over. Compare the endings of the two films: one admits ambiguity and despair, the other absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
