This film looked interesting. I had read the book a few years ago and he had taught me that the feature film closely followed the plot. <br /> <br /> He started looking at it and from the beginning he did not meet expectations. In fact, I did not bother to look at everything ... a pure voice - poor performance, bad acting, and hateful characters - that was the goal of the movie, I guess . <br /> <br /> Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and puts me on a downer for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
