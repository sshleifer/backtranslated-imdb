I only watched this film because I was very impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But it's not a SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and made sense. The bullfighter had none of this. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it could not be good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a leading role. <br /> <br /> A poster here called the incoherent movie. Another called it the worst movie of all time. Both gave too much credit to the film. I'm so glad I got it for free at the library, but I still feel ripped off. <br /> <br /> IMDb must include a "0" in the vote "note this movie", only for movies like this one.
