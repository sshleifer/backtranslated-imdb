Some people do not like animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable given the end of the film. There are a lot of older cartoons that I love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but the way it was built. The characters are all just ... good, awkward. And for this film, they should not be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a problem with lameness (to start with.) The way they acted in general annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing for most of this movie. I think that if many people had seen this before seeing the most recent, they would not have left. I'm glad I rented this and not bought it. There are few movies that give me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, although it is ranked among the best. Or down below, depending on your point of view.
