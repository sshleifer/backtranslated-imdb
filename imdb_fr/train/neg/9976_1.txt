The first scene of 'Problem Child' has a baby pissing on a nun's face. For this film, it's spiritual. A nasty and petty "comedy", she is inept on so many levels that she defies conventional wisdom. John Ritter is the kind father who embraces the child of hell and congratulates him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding one-note attack, boring performances and childish humor. And what the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Softly directed by Dennis Dugan and odious in his attempts to kindle sentimentalism when it's done with cruelty, the movie is done so badly that it's a pretty weird experience. But no matter all that. Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unpleasant kid actor of all time, is the culmination of the scene. Believe me, you will want to hit it in your mouth.
