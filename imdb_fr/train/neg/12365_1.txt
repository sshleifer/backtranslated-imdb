I think this trash is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators think that kids nowadays want stupid versions of GI JOE's good stories ??? The Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean, come on !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this junk is just one example of silly corporate decisions that only want to create a silly show cheap kids will love because, hey !! ! kids love super heroes, right? the whole series is a waste of time, because we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of superheroes, it does not seem to displease, but the problem is that this series strives too much to copy series like batman the animated series, or the new league of justice, the result ??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else's bunny bugs) the problem is that Looney Tunes was not supposed to be dramatic, they were supposed to be funny !!!! as I said before this series fears, and many people are wondering why the anime takes it all over the world ??? this series is meant to be dramatic and action-packed, but it's something that few shows and anime are able to do, if you want to see a good update of an old series, Tiny Toons, it's is an example that can be revived. old characters, but with a good history and respecting the original roots. Too bad that this show is already dead, I suppose another wise decision of the company.
