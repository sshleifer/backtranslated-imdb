It's an art film that was made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film clearly appears as a clue to this period - with some camera and pop art styles in the late 60's and early 70's. <br /> The film consists of three images simple ones that are distorted using different strange camera towers. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or intrigue of any kind. This was obviously designed as a form of performance art, and like most performance arts, it's interesting at first, but it quickly becomes tedious. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is totally boring and will not please anyone except those who made the film, their family and friends, and maybe even some people who are too trendy to be understood by ourselves. mortals.
