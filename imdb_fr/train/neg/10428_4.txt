Has anyone else felt as betrayed as me? The first hour was pretty solid but the last. Oh my God. It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic as the entire series of the show was. Most of the reviews have been read but I really do not understand why. I had seriously predicted this WAY general ending earlier, but I retracted because I thought, "No, they would never do that, it's way too lame." I can hardly bear it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm about to go out the door and sell every season I own. Someone please. Change your mind I want to like that Pity. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Big show. Terrible end.
