In what I can say, it was a robbery of my time, I was taken to see this movie and I must say it was a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill critic. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no income that this movie will generate. The banal plot tries to compete with other Roma comedians and fits perfectly into the landscape. It was like watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this film was a waste of time and space. I saw better movies on youtube.
