I go to the movies about every week and I regularly visit this site, but I have never felt obliged to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> From my unprecedented list of terribly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the character called "Hollow Man". <br /> <br /> Among the terrible opening titles - a ridiculously long course of distribution and the team combined with alphabetti spaghetti - until the insulting finale - a record number of world snapshots and some some of the most absurd dialogues and dialogues in filmmaking - this film is lamentable, and only the impressive infographic prevents you from going out well before the end. <br /> <br /> It's not that my opinion is that of my friends and all those around us. When large sections of the audience laugh and moan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, he was sick too. The director has gone beyond the bounds of realistic realism for a violent film and found himself in the realm of a film B soaked in blood. It is hard not to imagine the director as a sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's incursions out of the laboratory and into the outside world was limited to two attempts to feel breasts. Maybe sex might be the first thing you think in a guy's mind if it's made invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it does not make cinema entertaining. <br /> <br /> [Defenders follow] <br /> Pass in front of the sick movies outside, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon is doing a good job as a hollow man, his role is getting more and more twisted, but the rest of them - perhaps crippled by a dramatic scenario - are even better at being an empty cast. A long-time team member is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man. "He was finally slammed," shrugged one of his colleagues without emotion. This is normal, and the laboratory team oscillates between sheer terror and total indifference with such rapidity that you wonder how she became an actress. They make their way through the halls of the labs, guns in the air, but a few seconds later, one of the team members happily jumps down the hall to fetch blood for a wounded colleague. The main woman treats the unseen man with courtesy and good humor even after insulting and mistreating her, and there seems to be little response to her flares, even after he drowns the Pentagon leader, "It's 'is drowned in her pelvis last night' same woman, missing dramatically to reunite two and two. <br /> <br /> The scenario is littered with this kind of poorly played pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of movie clich√©s, which are sinking more and more faster than the film goes ahead to the point of total disbelief and amusement at the end. <br /> <br /> The moment "eureka" at the computer, the woman undressing at the window, the video looping safety - the list is really endless - predictable disregard for the strength of the number, the decision not to kill the two main stars but to put them in a likely imminent death and let them fend for themselves, the good guy almost dead appearing from nothing to save the woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous country tdown timer, the explosion of the fireball that burns just before reaching the heroes, the fall that stops just before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the villain. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Man is burnt under the magnifying glass with a makeshift flamethrower, electrocuted, hit in the head by a bar that had just crossed one of the smaller actors and then apparently survived to the explosion, the fireball and the total destruction of the laboratories, there is enough life left to climb into the fireball and give a last impulse to the heroes of the film - the unbelieving spectator then begins to crack and watch their watches. <br /> <br /> This exceptionally bad movie has actually made it the cinema is stunning. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the film itself, and not even the most impressive special effects fail to save this one, which must be avoided at all costs.
