This should be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I have almost never seen. (I could not look at him all the way) Simply and simply, it's gratuitous violence just for the sake of it, and the ridiculous scenario only adds to the dull and incompetent filming. Sick. And only suitable for those who like manic mutilation. After having murdered several hundred men, women and children, Seed was finally arrested after he had effortlessly killed several other policemen who were finally informed of his whereabouts. He is sentenced to death by an electric chair and survives miraculously! Buried alive, he fights his way and takes revenge against those who put him aside and operated the switch. Needless to say, more horrific murders ensue ...
