Why do filmmakers always go against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed in the interest of the viewer, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They have done a remarkable job of combining important events into a coherent and simply delicious whole. I can not believe they chose to combine three novels for Anne d'Avonlea in such a mess. Look at everything they missed by doing that. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake !!! Would not it have been great to meet Priscilla and all the other Redmond gang members? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of mixing them and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels! But the fine work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This movie was disappointing after seeing the success with which it gave life to Anne of Green Gables.
