Really, really bad movie slasher. A psychotic person escapes from the asylum. Three years later, he kills a professor of sociology at the end of the stage. Yesterday, a semester later (that's what the title card says), a new professor of sociology is at school. She becomes friends with another sociology professor who works there and starts attending another teacher. Students are bored, as are we. <br /> <br /> A number of title cards indicate the elapsed time. The scenes are quite short and cut into different characters somewhere, allowing no progression. Many scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and are useless. Despite the passage of time, many characters still wear the same clothes. Sometimes the time passing is blurred when we see a body for the second time, we wonder: how long has this body been? In addition, at least one of the dead does not seem to have missed the others. <br /> <br /> The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the chest, another stabbing her in the fork and another cutting her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The jacket of the video box has a cheerleader: there is none in the film. The back cover features a photo of a person wearing a graduation cap and a dress threatening a group of women in a dormitory. The central redhead on the picture is in the film, but no one ever wears such an outfit, and this scene does not exist. The killer is strictly one against one.
