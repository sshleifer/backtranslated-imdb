Wonderful. Yet another film about America from someone who visited here probably half a dozen times, one day a piece, and who considers himself an "expert" of the country. Sheesh. I should go on a trip to Germany for a week, then come back and make a film about Germany as a "Nazi country". Wim IL, you should meet Lars von Trier and make the movie ULTIMATE about Americans. Of course, we all know that it takes a pretentious leftist "we are the world" European to make a "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's it. For a continent that has started not one, but TWO world wars, Europe has many opinions on the bad "foreign policy" of the United States. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, boy, there are many UC-Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, it is the same people who think that George W. Bush is worse than Hitler and that a table representing a can of soup is "an absolute genius" !!
