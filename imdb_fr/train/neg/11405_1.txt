I had to watch that at school. And to summarize ... <br /> <br /> Actors without talent, scenario without talent and director without talent. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time. Do not even watch the movie. Do not bother yourself. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it was supposed to be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little. The actors in the movie were just bad. The best actor was the old man and that does not say much. He has a horrible plot with awful characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it makes no sense. The script was non-emotional and confusing. There were moments in the film when I frowned and said "What?" There were also too many links and holes in the plot. It was absolutely horrible.
