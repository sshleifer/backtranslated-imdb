I'm excited when I saw the commercials of this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading the book recently, I prepared for great difficulties, as often happens when stories are translated into films. The characters did not seem to match the book very well. The direction was weak. I had trouble getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not explain correctly what was happening. It just seemed slapped and hurried. Overall, I was very disappointed with the movie. I guess if you have not read the book, it might be fine. At the very least, it may inspire you to read the book, which you will probably appreciate more. <br /> <br />
