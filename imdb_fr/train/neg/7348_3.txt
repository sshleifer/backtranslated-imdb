I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked at Polyester and I really hated it. The only thing I liked in this movie was DIVINE. She / he was very talented. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
