It's one of the worst movies I've seen so far. The best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" who was trying to play by jumping outside the bar, much like I wanted to do on the DVD, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this movie from shit. It has an excellent cast, so you keep waiting until everything goes well, I mean with Sean Astin "Andrew" (did a great job, did a great job, too bad in this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poet" (they put her name on the cover, she has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the whole film ... <br /> <br /> > If the cast had any dignity, they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them with the writer / director George Hickenlooper and the writer John Enbom
