First of all, I do not know at all how this movie went on the big screen. It's not even the low-budget movie from SCI-Fi, it's just awful. Me and my friend in love with action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc., we went to see this film while waiting for this film to call me Transformers with dragons, a senseless entertainment. We only had an hour and a half without brains. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so horrible that the acting, it compensated. It's basically a Chinese leg of dragons coming back every 500 years ... It sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, the plot is trying to be deeper than it should be, leaving not only holes, but with magic and a very small war between dragons (rather big snakes), it just becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add a little humor to the film that failed. My friend and I laughed during the whole process (as well as the 5 spectators) and we could not believe that we spent money on it. The short trailer on television makes up for most of the action while shit makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B-movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say, if you want to laugh all the time for an hour, look at this. <br /> <br /> History: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but that would have helped me before watching this movie
