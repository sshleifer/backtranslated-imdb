It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but that's about all we can say. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is sterile and alienating, the atmosphere is "strange". And then ... nothing. Well, something. There is no doubt that something is not in the same realm ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the weird but not particularly intimidating creatures and the hospital they have taken care of. I mean, come on, biker biker? Some groups looked a little too much Gwar. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the chief demon, who looked a lot like a middle-aged trucker who was desperately trying to threaten himself, all the while pretending that he really preferred to collapse on a couch covered with Afghans, undo his belt, open a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen much more scary truckers. At truck stops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more caricaturists and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos give explanations about their presence in the hospital ... they seem to appear randomly in places, play "metal" noisy and cause death a little people. Apart from some good special effects and an action game that is not quite terrible given the lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. It's a background sound film only.
