Looked on Hulu (way too many ads!), So it broke the rhythm but it was still like watching a very bad boyfriend movie of the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both roles are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest against the representation of all men as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for music videos for Western sales and used a lot of Western models for men to touch them. I generally enjoy Indian movies, but it was a major disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not happen in India (the uncle continues to refer to the time Mac returns to India) but I can not know where this is supposed to happen.
