I must say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. They had a very good story to tell, but they did so badly. First of all, the cast is wrong, where does this peeble van (shit actor) come from and puff daddy ??? Looks like Carlito comes from the hood and hangs out with real idiots. This film does not do justice to "Carlitos Way". I am so happy that the sequel "Carlito's Way" was released first. If I had already seen this garbage, I would never have given a chance to the pacino version. And anyway, Pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought it's crap and followed up instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 in 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10
