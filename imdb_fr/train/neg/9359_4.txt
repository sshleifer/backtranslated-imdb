This film is probably pro-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lived his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he is apparently Muslim because of his hairstyle, because he kept his amulet and his clothes. He has a six-year-old child wearing the same hat and is probably a Muslim, although his mother is Christian. The main character therefore chooses, it seems, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other main male characters, who are Christian, seem to beget a child. So it seems there are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it.
