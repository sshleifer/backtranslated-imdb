That's pretty ridiculous, I hope a lot of people will be exposed to Muslims who live all over the United States, the UK and around the world. Religion has more than one billion followers. I was born and I am bread and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings, I was taught to cherish my country and to work to contribute to society. I am very attached to the following points, and the teachings of my religion have been put to the test throughout life to educate us and prepare us for success through education to help us return to the world. I know many Muslims everywhere and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have not met anyone yet who believes that we should harm anyone or accept any religion other than that of journalists. I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent an entire religion. It's a religion of one billion people, and it's less than one percent, I'm sure other peoples of other faiths would not want to be represented by KKK, IRA and many others who are simply low-percentage extremists who use literal passages from respected books to pursue their own personal or commercial revenge issues through their so-called religion
