The real irony is: Joe Besser was a leading comedian, in other situations far from the Stooges. He had a clear record of being very funny and intelligent. Moe, Larry and Shemp knew him or at least knew him for many years and loved his job. So what happened when he joined the troupe as the "third stooge"? Obviously nothing. In most of these "Stooge's End" shorts, most often, the boys face each other or Joe versus the other two and it's not a specific Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, every man for himself", to quote Curly of "Restless Knights". One thing about a good team of comedians, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they are all trying to take advantage of each other or to slap themselves, when the chips are down, come using the other. In this particular case, none of this happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight when we try to deceive others or be mean and mean, and not for a comic effect either. One might think that something was happening behind the scenes: art imitates life. Maybe that's why Besser did not spend much time with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
