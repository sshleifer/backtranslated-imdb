This film was rented by a friend. His choice is normally good. I first read the cover and was expecting a good movie. Although it is <br /> <br /> a horror movie. What I do not prefer But no horror came to mind watching the movie. It was a dull movie, <br /> <br /> little fun. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was again a pleasure for the eyes. But that's all. We (the four) <br /> <br /> we are a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this film and judge it yourself.
