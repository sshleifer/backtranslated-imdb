OK, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine it being better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I can say is the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. There is almost no quality that redeems this film. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. This may seem realistic in a way, but it is best not to tell real stories. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow slow motion movies, as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but it allows introspection and gives the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is just filled with stupid dialogues that manage to tell us little about the characters. None of those that I could identify or treat. In many scenes, I found myself thinking, "When will they shut up?" The acting game was pretty bad. Not obvious and excessive. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters and they all seemed to want to be elsewhere in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue that has been given to them. In addition, the entire course of the film seemed quite mechanical. Move from one scene to another. It seems that this film was written (badly) but never realized. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that, in my opinion, generates no emotional reaction from the scenes. No suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest, whatever it is. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-film.
