The third installment of the "Carnosaur" trilogy contains a group of Keystone Kops quality military commandos attempting to kill two Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give him a 4 for pure sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can not be taken seriously. More significantly, however, watching this movie, I can not help but notice some interesting parallels between the trilogies "Carnosaurus" and "Xtro". The first part of the two franchises is a dark and disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "Alien" scam, and the third is a foolish film, almost foolish (intentional or not) that you have rolled on the ground laughing. In addition, like the franchise "Xtro", all films "Carnosaur" are completely independent of each other. They only carry the name of the franchise to arouse interest in "suites," I suppose. It is obvious that "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen the three films from both franchises, you'll find yourself going back and forth between the two.
