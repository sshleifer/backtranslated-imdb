Given the money budgeted for this movie, you would expect more from the story. This could be the most worthless movie I have ever seen. There was no real progress of anything. Character development, minimal. Progress of the plot, perhaps. Enjoyment, none. I am not sure that arguments have even been tried. If you want to see a movie in which the terrorists are kind enough, the American CIA bombards everything that is wrong with our opinions, all the capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see something that looks like a progression of scenario with a death. For those of us who realize that it is not necessary to kill a good guy to make a point, we will stick to other movies. In a nutshell, it was a horrible attempt for a movie at the hiding place that must think, because he does not know what's going on, no one who did the movie did it either. Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.
