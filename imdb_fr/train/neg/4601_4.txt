I did not know anything about the previous work of the writer or the director, so I had not brought any prejudice to the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the implausibility rested on the implausibility. Every turn of the plot seemed to be a pretext for sowing more bloodshed, macabre makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The score is professional and Kari Wuhrer seems to be a good actress but the rest was more than disappointing. It was positively disgusting. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the vagaries of the story, but I will give an example of what I consider to be an excess of explicit gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch and pulls the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt) out of the cold. McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a piece in his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's disappearance. (What are the cops going to do to measure his bite radius?) McKenna pulls Wendt's head and neck out of the freezer bag he's in, picks up an ax and starts cutting off Wendt's head. Beat. Beat. Beat. The end of the ax does not stop tearing Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets of frozen flying flesh, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He takes it off when he's finished.) McKenna then pulls his frozen head out for a small fire he's built. He puts his head on the floor, crouches next to him, takes pictures of a woman he has just killed and shows them at the head of Wendt. "Do you remember her? We could have done it if it was not for you," he said to the head. "Duc, you've always loved bonfires, have not you?" he asks. Then he puts his head on the fire. We only have a glimpse of its burning, but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want this type of waste to be censored. I only wonder who likes to see this stuff. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the film. Well, I'll give an example of an "improbability", since I mentioned the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark, naked cabin. He knows he'll be half-bruised in the next few days. (He literally invited the heavier ones to do it.) What would you do in this situation similar to Poe's? Here's what McKenna does for what could be the last night of his life. He finds a defeated calendar with a pin-up and masturbates (successfully). Give this man the medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza the Hut is plunged into useless flashbacks. The camera is often hand-held and flickering. The dialogue has lines such as "Life is a piece of s ***, otherwise it's the best of all possible worlds, depending on your point of view." A wide-angle lens is used to turn ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes into an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, McKenna, advances towards us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> He is also a hero. He first kills a man for $ 13,000 by beating him several times in the head with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before tipping a refrigerator over his body. (That annoys him a little, but not enough to prevent him from insisting that he be paid.) Then I hope I have the order tidy, he kills Wendt by tearing a part of his neck. Then he kills the woman of her first victim by accident and holds the people responsible for it, though by almost all moral calculations they have nothing to do with it. Then he burns the honcho chief (Baldwin) alive. Then, after disabling the two lower heavyweights, he deliberately explodes them, although one of them is not totally unfriendly. And we are supposed to encourage McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not cartoon deaths, like those of Dirty Harry's movies: let's get away and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first - the $ 13,000 murder - is done awkwardly to look like what could happen in real life. Killing another human being, as Hitchcock demonstrated in Torn Curtain, is not really easy. But this scene does not lead to anything important. <br /> <br /> Some people might benefit, especially those who are young enough to think that pain and death only occur in movies. Some meretricious stuff on the screen here.
