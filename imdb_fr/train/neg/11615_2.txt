Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name in the opening credits of 'Joshua'. Heck, I did not even know he was in 'Joshua' before starting the movie. It goes without saying that I watched the film on the basis of the film, not on the tracks. A kind of "Rosemary Baby", "The Omen" or any other demonic children's movie "Joshua" was featured. Unfortunately, he fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. Still, I continued to see how all this would resolve, hoping beyond belief that the final climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit it, it did (a little bit) but what a flawed closure. And what a low-budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls ?? you do not see gout, you see someone lying in what seems to be blood. Someone gets hit by a taxi? you do not see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike in the air. I do not know if it's called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father who tries to balance everything, a child ?? Joshua, who may / may not be the antichrist and a newborn who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she is alive ?? and what was that? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother crazy? Is Joshua mad? Is he just jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will he become Michael Myers? Or does he lead his family to the edge of the precipice? I do not think so. They were nuts before, and no "so-called" actor could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, hardly the questions asked, hardly open doors closed. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Whatever. There are many better children's movies gone crazy to explore. Joshua is more like the mini-self of the antichrist.
