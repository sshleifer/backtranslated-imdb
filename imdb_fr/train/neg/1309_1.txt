This movie was extremely boring. This should not be less than 15 minutes. The images of the child and the animal being killed were a bit awkward. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not write comments, but this one is so bad that it contains many good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are one step closer to an honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What can I say more? I fall asleep during this film 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up after 8 hours of prolonged sleep. I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters, except perhaps 2 sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep once while looking at it, do not try to rewind and catch up because you are going back to sleep.
