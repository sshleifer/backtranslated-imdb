Man oh man! What a shabby movie piece! But it's a guilty pleasure since my childhood even if I hate to admit it. They showed this movie all the time on my basic system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border), we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie again and again, again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her tragic adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The scenario has almost no meaning, the direction is bad, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialogue so bad that it's good and a beautiful Carole King song played in the final credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
