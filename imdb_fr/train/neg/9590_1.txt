The film is based on an authentic 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes has written a series of three "novels in London": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr. 'love and justice'. I read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, maybe an experience that did not happen. But McInnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. This musical is the ultimate nightmare of the novelist: seeing the fruits of his mind turn into a one-dimensional apology soporific, sneaky and poorly made, a film that says he captures the spirit of the 50s in London and does not nothing like. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Colin McInnes was not alive to witness it.
