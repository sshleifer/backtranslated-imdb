As a single over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and degrading for singles over 40, not to mention all other women of all ages. It was a sad and pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chick movie", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not really an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent plot (I hate to even talk about conspiracy), she had no chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film realistic or believable. And then, there is the obligatory male fantasy of a pretty straight woman who suddenly decides to try lesbianism - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only would I like to get my money back for DVD rental, I want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a scam.
