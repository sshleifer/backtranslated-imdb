I love a good, skinny love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented "Love Story", I prayed for the end to come as fast and as short as possible, and on the contrary for the character of Ali McGraw. <br /> <Ali McGraw in the role of Jenny alienated and pissed me off in the first 15 minutes. When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I can not help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if anyone who looks at this film cares. If she did not die, her squeaky personality would probably have pushed Oliver over her threat and eventually ended up in a divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70s.
