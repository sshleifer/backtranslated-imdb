I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - the others being THE WIFE Christmas and JACK FROST. The three films talk about death. If you like to be completely depressed, then watch this movie or any other movie. In this film, the acting is good and some sets (except when people die) are beautiful. But, I'm afraid a clinically depressed person could accidentally see the movie and be heard! Despite a "happy forever" ending, most of this film is a terrible disaster after another. And, for crazy reasons, I DO NOT WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I'm watching a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy, after all, it's not mouth and feeling unhappy anyway ?). <br /> <br /> For a more vivid visual experience, try the Christmas Tree House or George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or A Christmas STORY - unless of course you like to be miserable.
