"Show me your crazy!" It's not funny, and certainly not on a channel that broadcasts cartoons if you understand where I'm from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old girls to think like that or hear that. I find it sad that Nick made the impression of saying that shit, and that's what we have, stupid kids acting like stupid adults. I know it's supposed to be humorous, but consider that we have sweet, innocent girls in kindergarten and grade one who are eager to see that. I had to comment how disappointed I was when I saw him. My daughters are not going to watch it. I'd love to block Nick but I do not have the heart for now, but if Nick continues to release that kind of bullshit, I'll have to do it.
