This film is horrible. Everything has been done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand when writers do not offer their own intrigues. <br /> <br /> A girl makes a wish on the occasion of her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it looks a lot like a movie in the 80s called Big. What is even more annoying is the role of Jennifer Garner. She does not act like she's 13, she just behaves like she's stupid. <br /> <br /> From that moment, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it turns out that a friend she was at age 13 is working with her. Wow this is great! But, no ... her friend is mean and picks on her, trying to find her job. But, of course, she wins in the end when she offers a "good" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie I've seen a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
