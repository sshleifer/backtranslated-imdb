Note to Horror fans: The only horror that comes up here is when you realize that you've just lost 95 minutes of your life on a film that is so bad, that's insulting. <br /> <br /> I looked at it because: <br /> <br /> The premise seemed slightly promising: it is not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame scenes of other low-budget slasher movies that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of bare nymphs from the forest seemed nice even if the film was horrible: it is not the case. It's so not. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are about as sexy as the average homeless. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He is the king of special effects at low budget and interim low budget. If you think about it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that it's bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role has been in From Dusk Till Dawn, and since then he has taken it into account in the conventions of horror. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of what not to do a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the author is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. It's all given after the first 10 minutes. But the disorderly step; the director's treatment of "intrigue" and "characterization" as a nuisance that he does not think anyone cares about anyway; and the extremely long and boring sequences of driving, walking and nature (probably added to increase the duration of the film's broadcast), show a total lack of skills for film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number one way to determine if a movie is going to be bad: if it's written and directed by the same person, do you expect it to be otherwise.
