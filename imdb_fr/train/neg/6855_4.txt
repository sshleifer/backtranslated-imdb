Why can not a woman be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the main man? The campaign director of this film dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House. That's all she can think of. So why on earth must she have an affair with him? It adds nothing to the plot and only serves to belittle successful women. The only value of this treat was the pretty scene "we all slept with your husband". <br /> <br /> In the same way, could the authors of the film not have been able to look at the national conventions to which they falsified? Dissemination between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
