Almost as tedious to watch as it is to read, Evening is a failure that's beautifully produced ... until Meryl Streep arrives and quietly shows her other cast members how to play that kind of stuff. Vanessa Redgrave is shocked by her role as Ann Dying and Claire Danes is a number. Maybe if Vanessa and Claire had exchanged their roles, we could have seen the dynamism of the young Ann who allowed her to enter the rarefied world of history and we could have imagined that old Ann was dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that adding Michael Cunningham to the credits would reduce the unstable narrative, but alas. It gave me a headache.
