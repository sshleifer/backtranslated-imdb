Usually, I know after the first minute of a movie whether I will hate it or worship it ... but now, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning was great; "This is based on a true story" and blah blah blah was funny. After, the caricatures and the description of the life of the guys with pictures made me think that I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing the hilarious faux look of Toronto was cool. In addition, the location and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> It was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looked like an eternity. <br /> <br /> It may be just that I do not understand English Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians do not always understand Quebec humor), but hey ... he There was enough stuff in this movie for a short film, nothing more. Maybe that could make sense for the title? In any case, almost everything was satiating, and very few things were even funny to me. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "making of" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great. That's why I rented the movie, being interested in the "disappearance of annoying people". However, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and with that even a point of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are Canadian English, it seems that you can appreciate the local humor, given the surprising number of people who gave this film a 8. Otherwise, think twice before waste your precious time ...
