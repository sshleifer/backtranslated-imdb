It is difficult to formulate in words the almost boiling hatred that I have of this film. But I'm going to try: <br /> <br /> All the other words were crazy, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and stereotypes were beyond the norm, and even offensive to Italo-Americans. <br /> <I do not say that the acting was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito and. al, well performed. But ... almost all the characters in the movie I despised. Since the Bonfire of the Vanities, I did not like all the characters on the screen.
