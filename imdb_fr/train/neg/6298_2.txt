A terrible story (Friends at worst), a useless and conscious "decadence", an obvious shock tactic and a fragmented game of actors make this film (a bit like "Rancid Aluminum") all that went wrong with the much vaunted British renaissance. Humor is, at best, soft, and the pretense of the whole thing (including some kind of "terrorist group on the Internet" - oh, how contemporary) really starts to creak. <br /> <br /> Final summary - a half-cooked attempt to be "pissed off" that does not the slightest favor. It's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen ... <br /> <br />
