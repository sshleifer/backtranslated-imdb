As for the movies, it's quite nice. Fun characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I really wish he did not irritate me a lot while observing the lack of respect that emerges, which shows the city in which he is. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet each character is English (with the exception of Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are only ephemeral in subordinate roles and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a spectator who likes her "real" movies to be a bit closer to reality), I really do not think it would have hurt to use one of the countless talented Scottish actors. .. or at least had English people who could mix a decent accent! The futile attempt to repeatedly use the word "wee" only reinforced the insult.
