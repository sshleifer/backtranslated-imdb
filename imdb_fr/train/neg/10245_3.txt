I was expecting a lot of this movie. A bit like Lee as Naustradamous, but all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. There were wooden scenes, terrible texts drawn from biblical texts such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But it was at the end! For the rest, we had to wait and hope that something significant happened, but that did not happen. This film tells the story of a couple trying to understand the changes that are happening in the world, such as places in China where an earthquake took place and ending up in a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent ends up being the key of the unfortunate. The whole film is deceptive and boring. One of the worst of Lees.
