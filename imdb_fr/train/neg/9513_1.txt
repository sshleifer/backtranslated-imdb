I tried to watch this movie three times. At night I rented it. I spent about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night of rest. Watched 15 others the next day, almost vomited how stupid it was ... It was not even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just a shit with a capitalized S the censored world in which we live). And finally, the third day, I watched for over an hour the stupidity and I did not enjoy a moment! Not one. How did this script get the green light? Oh my God! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - One for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their efforts.
