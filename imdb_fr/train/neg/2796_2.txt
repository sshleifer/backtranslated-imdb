for the most part, On Demand offers horrifying horror movies and only offers other horror movies that everyone has seen and already have an opinion on. It was either that, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg's films), that I did not see, and I was actually in a movie mood, which happens more often, because I I've watched all the movies I've had a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I'm not very interested in new movies, and damn it, that movie made me miss it. I'm not going to do any damage, I'm just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half-decent. I think the main girl, the one who died and kills everyone, is very boring but convincing; I would take it every day for a psychopathic bitch, so she's fine, even if she's lame. The blood is not terrible, only some of the victims, or can I say that "the wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there is no accessory in the film that can make the wounds more convincing. Towards the end of the movie, I begged my girlfriend to turn it off. As a member of the group, the "recording" parts were not very interesting either, although what was going to happen actually happens during the recording. I'm done, if you want to watch this, do it.
