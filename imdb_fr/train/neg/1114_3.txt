In this day and age of incredible special effects of the film, this one was a painful disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerns are not so common in Hollywood lately, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone always knows how to make a good one. Given this, it is hard to imagine that anyone would incur expenses for the release, let alone create a film as weak as this one. If you like and look for a good western, keep looking!
