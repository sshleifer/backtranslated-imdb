Ah yez, the Sci Fi channel produced Yeti, another horrendous movie. I was particularly impressed by the scenes that immediately followed the accident. At least half a dozen fires were burned while the survivors were desperately searching for matches. for no apparent reason ?? at various points of the wreck. Fire seemed to be a predominant theme. They searched the bodies for lighters and matches, then finally found a box where a fire was burning every day for 12 years, but no one has ever collected wood. Then, when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use to accelerate? I mean these guys were frozen ?? well maybe not. Despite the apparently low temperature, the whole Yeti ate, bleeding. Maybe it's just me, but even in a totally unbelievable story (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the end), if you you take care of small things, larger contracts become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, hot enough to hold in his hand, froze and did not shoot. Leave me alone. At least we have Carly Pope, another eminently beautiful Canadian girl. And with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I would add that the rabbit they ate (although it looks like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. If it was a squirrel (or a rat), it was a rodent, but it still looked like chicken. And the writers missed a real chance to have someone to write down "it tastes like ..."
