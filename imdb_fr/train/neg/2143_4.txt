I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella and always loved it so much that the cassette is a little worn. <br /> <br /> As a result, I was delighted to see that Cinderella 2 was going to be on television and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins the club of movie suites that should be left to their own devices. It contains absolutely NO original super tanks! This seems to me quite brutal and almost brutal, (s) does not sing to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the character telling a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was laid on top, and did not seem to match. Jaq's transformation into a human being is an excellent example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding some nonsense here and there, he should have been dancing and singing how great it was to be great! And in the ballroom, there is old country music like barn dancing. It's as if the writers had forgotten where and when this story unfolded. Optimistic fiddles certainly did not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the illustrations and animation of Cinderella 2 are not up to the original. The illustrations in this film seem rather crude and less detailed. And we see some of Cinderella's plaid skirt, which does not seem to be going well. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it should have been that. I would not say that I hate it, but I think there were a lot of gaps. It seems to degrade significantly compared to the beloved original Cinderella.
