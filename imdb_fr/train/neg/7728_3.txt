.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw this and its sequel when it first aired was blown away like so many others. In early 2002, I borrowed the novels for WOW, W and R and was even more impressed. I decided to review both and I invested $ 200 and more in the DVDs. I looked at the two minis again with painful details and realized that I had done things upside down - I should have bought the novels and borrowed the DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not you think it's a catastrophic mistake? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not think it's dated? Filter it for a person not old enough to have seen it originally and watch the reaction you get (beware - the reactions of such people go from horror looks to belly laughs). <br /> <br /> From the trivia section of This mini-Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yuck !! Quality of production, music score, dialogue - a beautiful story was turned into a soap opera of the late 70's by a producer / director too ambitious and totally overwhelmed by the head. This thing was dated the minute it was finished. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great during the original broadcast. For those who saw them at that time, pull on a nostalgic chain that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - this mini does not respect his reputation and disappoints severely.
