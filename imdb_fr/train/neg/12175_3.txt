Why review good movies when you can see "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is so lame. I can just imagine the casting and the team driving around LA with a camcorder, throwing extras into a stupid monster make-up in front of poor Tim Thomerson, who has been suffering for a long time. The families of the stars are like cameos, probably because Full Moon could not afford "real" supplements. Dark effects, lame scenery and a complicated scenario that would require dice to untie all the knots - it must be classic transsexuals! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... that reigns. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say it because it's true. What better way to watch an old man dressed in a trench coat mow zombies, then break his mouth with quips like "Do not worry, ladies, they're biodegradable"? Well, a lot of things could be better, but anyway, that's still a good thing. <br /> <br /> My only important reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks the joint. She is an ugly rival for Helen Hunt's character - they are two young candies in her eyes, and it would have been more effective if they contrasted a little more. Oh, you can not have everything. At least, the wonderful device of the plot of the "long second watch" is back, and we have more than Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he has a rival the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I have not seen this recently, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick ran away twice during the final battle. Hooray for the ugly continuity! One of the many highlights of this beautiful movie.
