It may be the worst movie of my life. Incoherent would be a compliment. Even the end made no sense, but it was a huge relief that it was finally over. I watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and that's what happened. At the end of this mess, I was sorry that none of the characters survived and I did not feel too charitable towards the actors. If you want to watch a train wreck, I recommend spending time in a train station. Even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. Apparently, I did not ventilate enough to fill the ten prescribed lines. Therefore, at the risk of losing my job, I will repeat it once again. This film is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for a note even lower. How about minus zero?
