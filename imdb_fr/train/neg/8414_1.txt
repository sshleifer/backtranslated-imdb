Yeah. I'm sure I saw this film a few years ago, when it was about the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled paper story glitters like Hollywood, borrowing scripts from some of the best movies in the music industry. </ p> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, more sumptuous costumes and choreography = more money for Beyonce's dubious "talented" draw. <br /> If you like the style of regression, you should appreciate the real groups that have struggled (without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical trash.
