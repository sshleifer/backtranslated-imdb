Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrible. It is hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would have invested money in this project. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films already destroyed at the box office, it is almost inconceivable that any studio would want to join this scenario. <br /> <br /> seemed to be some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Blank Point with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But after only 90 seconds of filming, it is obvious that this is an unsuccessful attempt by DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked Cusacks' films so much that I thought I might risk seeing the DVD of it. I have to say I do not know if Cusack is sane enough that I can even watch another feature film starring him again, unless someone else can testify. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is ready to commit suicide. Tom Cruise has never been so far. Not even close.
