Hahahaha !!!!!! It's funny, it sums up this movie in a nutshell.What was shit this "thing" because it could kill me to use the word movie!?!?! The producer did not want it to go well, because that's for sure! A scientist transforming his son hammerhead shark and shark killing a group of people that the scientist invited on the island! Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it, I laughed at all the serious things, because they were so old-fashioned and unprofessional .... and they could not have made the shark any more unrealistic even though this "thing" has a slightly larger budget than most low budget movies. All I have to say is to watch this film expect to laugh at all the bad actors and this stupid and nerdy dialogue, it will be very disappointed.
