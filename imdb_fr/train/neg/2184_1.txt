This film is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill-conceived intrigues. <br /> <br /> Film History: The director of this film was a pervert who drove the city by filming women at random. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly compose a story. He said he was making a movie called "The brain that would not die". Finally, his wife asked him to show him his "so-called movie". That night, he quickly filmed additional scenes with a friend and "The brain that would not die" was born. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Synopsis of Plot: The fiance of the main character is killed in a horrible car accident (which he caused by ignoring the clearly displayed road signs). He grabs his head in the wreckage and resuscitates it. After resuscitating his head, he goes to look for a group of prostitutes. That's about what happens for the rest of the movie. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a whore and I guess they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Notes: The end credit screen says that the movie is called "The head that would not die". <Br/> <br /> I hate this movie!
