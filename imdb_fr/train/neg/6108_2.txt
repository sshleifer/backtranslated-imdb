Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same era and, like the previous film, it does not look much like the literary character of Burroughs. But while the Tarzan of 1932 was reduced to the "Tarzan - Jane" speech, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or growl. He screams twice at Tarzan's shout, which seems to have been sampled in the previous movie. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays Bo Derek's second banana in the role of Jane. Or rather, as the third banana of Bo Derek's left breast and right breast. This film has no other purpose than to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes of the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. Further proof that nobody cared. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Tarzan has an orangutan kick in this movie. Maybe he shared his car from Sumatra with the Indian elephants also exposed.
