The time spent watching this movie was wasted time. I do not hate science fiction. I do not reject any genre in itself, since a good job can be done in any genre. This movie, however, is not a good job. I can not fault the visual elements (without extraterrestrial makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not completely unfortunate, for a trekkish comic book. But the fx visuals were obviously those where all the interests of decision makers were worn. The management alternated between slowness and confusion (it was not clear exactly who was doing what, with what and to whom and at least at a crucial moment). The "game" was mostly very bad. Most of the line readings were without foundation, except for a hint: "It was like that on the page and the director told me that I was supposed to be crazy / sad / scared / whatever. a pilot of the SF series Since when is this an excuse for correctable mediocrity in areas where should be considered essential for a dramatic media.I am surprised that the pilot has sold the series.Or the money is it also in the hands of technicians?
