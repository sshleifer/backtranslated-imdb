The good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. First-rate game production. Well-detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> The horrible mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes the Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI players seem even worse than the video games of a few years ago. Wrong logic. A giant pyramid appears and no one is looking for it, nobody really disputes it? And nothing explains why the god Horus was even hunted, and there's no reason why he should do something as trivial as Jill's impregnation. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Horrible Script. So many unnecessary side intrigues with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost laughable at times. Random characters and unnecessary events. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was only a mystery to the writer. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance, no texture. His character has no qualities that redeem. In fact, there is not a single character in the whole movie that has a purpose, a goal (aside from the obvious Horus), no motivation. They are weak and poorly designed. There is no stake - the key to writing on the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but he's really a bad guy. We can not even decipher if Horus or Jill is the main character. That's the problem: devoting half the film to each character means that the writer never explores a character and never ends it. These are cardboard cutouts that wander around and discuss and are almost just exploring the details. Director's first staging. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not be careful because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short and sometimes useless. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. Shooting history, development of the sub-par character, nerdy CGI does not save the beautiful production of sets.
