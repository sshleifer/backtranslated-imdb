One of the movies, if not the worst, to be released from Britain in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This story is a bit of a lick of mature age that "seduced" two teenage girls washers who keep it for himself and his false wife, has nothing to buy from him. <br /> <br /> Free of charge, childish, rude and unrealistic, this film plunges into the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is perhaps the way in which George Costigan's actors Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely assembled by such a lame scenario. It is therefore not surprising that this was the only fire job of Andrea Dunbar to appear on the screen. Complete and total garbage at all levels.
