Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty-one whose characters are inimitable, and an iguana-like lizard-man chases them and you have an idea of ​​the madness here. On the plus side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. There are no elbows or nocturnal scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like. he's just there people. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not so inspired. A little mystery could have helped. Mind you, I've seen a lot worse, but if you want to see it in large numbers throughout the movie, your monster will look more beautiful. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's an end to the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense. This was not surprising given the bad script writing. With regard to the acting of the actors; Well, let's just say it was not terribly bad, but I do not think we'll see a lot of these kids in future cinematic outings. <br /> <br /> Gore Daily: 2 out of 5; Nudity Quotient: 1 of 5; Intellectual Quotient: Negligible
