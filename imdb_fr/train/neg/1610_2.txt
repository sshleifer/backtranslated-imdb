What I found so curious about this movie - I saw the full version of the 4-hour roadshow is how strangely impartial it is. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in a gigantic political struggle, it is almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second-tier actor, with a slightly high-pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically go down to Castro saying to Che: Go ahead, go -y, do this and that, without any explanation as to the effect or use of this action. There is still no actor in the cast who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he was sidelined in a small part of the film. Second part. Without the tension and passion you expect from these men and their followers, the film becomes a long epic film about hairy and bearded men running in various jungles shouting and shooting aimlessly. Several critics I read praised the work of director Steven Soderbergh while almost completely ignoring the actors. (In fact, we spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital camera than about the plot or actors or the fact that it's all in Spanish with English subtitles.) It's a strange thing to do, because a) Soderbergh was just a pistol hired on the film and b) it's nothing but a competent job, with a blameless eye to Oliver Stone's JFK, filmed in black and white when shooting the camera during his visit to New York. If you can imagine Andrew McLaglen's reds instead of Warren Beatty, you'll get an idea of ​​the dull skill of this movie.
