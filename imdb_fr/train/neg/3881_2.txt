A few days ago, I watched a documentary entitled THE FIFTH WORST FILM OF ALL TIME, and it was here that I first heard about THE INCREDIBLE MAN OF THE FUSION. Being a schlocky movie lover, I make a point of trying to find some of the documentary's films - in addition to including THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since and I must say I'm rather disappointed. Although this is really a bad movie, it is far from far enough to appear on this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before I see the documentary, I appreciate the "bad movies" since I read Harry Medved's book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time". Despite the same title, the book came out well before the documentary and the documentary designers never attributed the concept to Medved. In Medved's book, I saw about 35 out of 50 movies, but I'm in a dead end - the rest of the movies are just not available in VHS or DVD. So, I thought I would try the movie of the same name. <br /> <br /> The INCREDIBLE FUSION OF MAN I was very disappointed, is that the film had some quality elements. First, the special effects of Melting Guy were generally very cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) has been involved to make this look realistic. However, I should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and derisory effects - such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after his left arm was cut - you could see him "skillfully" hidden "under his clothes! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously enters the rings of Saturn without being crushed. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - when we see close-ups. It's strange because Saturn is so far away - it should NOT look like this - it should be a big point. Anyway, the scene changes immediately and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, it's to guess. Shortly after, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous war while his whole body melts. <br /> <br /> Now that they have a psychopath that looks like a melting popsicle, you'd think the government would pull out all the stops to find it and stop it, right ?! False. A general hires a single doctor to find him !! No army, no police - just a dopey doctor. Even after the bodies have accumulated, the doctor or general does absolutely nothing to arrange a serious search or get a backup copy. <br /> <br /> Now, given the movie's stupidity, you will not be surprised either. to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the guy who is melting is running near the doctor's house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her at home. <br /> <br /> A charming old couple drives late into the night, it stops naturally in an orchard to pick fruit and is killed. <br /> <br /> When a lady sees a melting guy, she barricades the door to protect herself. It would be smart if she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she's just waiting! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and pulls her from the top. Why? Good to give the public a cheap thrill and make it a classified film. <br /> <br /> When the melting guy is finally located and the sheriff has a free shot, the doctor stops him - even if by now, the monster has killed half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the movie is full of stupid elements. It's a very bad movie. But, considering the occasional good special effects, it was just not a horrible movie as I had hoped. Of course, it's good to laugh, but we're not close to PLAN 9 FROM OUTTER SPACE and we should never have been on anyone's worst movie list.
