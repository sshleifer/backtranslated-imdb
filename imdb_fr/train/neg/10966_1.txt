A friend once told me that when the film closed, an independent independent art film was shown in a movie theater. The audience was so enraged that he was forced to tear up the cinema seats. Of course, my imagination was unleashed, trying to evoke the content of such work. Well, now, I can rest from my imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of always, Andrei Tarkovky and a passionate admirer of his work. I met many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films were slow and inert. The opinions being what they are, I found that this was not the case for the director's wonderful works, filled with meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called Tarkovsky's heir, I was delighted to discover his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the outdoor walk through the fields (Stalker), this film is unrelated to anything that Tarkovsky has completed. It does not seem to have any meaning, even at a completely insane level. This is supposedly "beautifully stark" cinematography is devoid of any craft composition. There is no balance, no proportion and the light meter seems to run out of batteries in the freezing snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive that you wonder if his father could have been alive if he had decided earlier. <br /> <br /> I'm not opposed to non-intrigues or intrigues that progress on several non-linear modes. But there is not even a non-story here. We must surely go into the screening of this film with the head shaved if we were to leave without gaining anything or losing anything, because the haircut would be the only possible answer to a rhythm that could give a sculpture of the time of Tarkosky looks like Jerry. Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short film. <br /> <br /> I will not exclude the fact that it may be one of Sokurov's (Tarkovsky's Solaris) thunderstorms, but I conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heirs, based on this film - would be to call Paris Hilton the successor of Aristotle. Come on guys, do not be afraid to say it. No amount of awesome big words magically bring back the corpse of celluloid to life. I do not pretend to fully understand Russian culture and I probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately understood Tarkovsky's work as something magical, treasure and a gift for the viewers. <br /> <br /> If that Sokourov's name was not on it, and it was aired on Saturday, for example, I'm pretty sure no one would read all those wonderful analyzes on this wet noodle movie.
