The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the cinema, that cold, wet and cold date. <br /> <br /> "The cat with the hat" was the name of the film and when it was over, I had a stomach ache. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers was playing the cat, his humor was bad, and the kids did not need to see that, that humor was not tamed. <br /> <the film looked like milk of milk, a rabid cow, so it's fun to have fun, but filmmakers did not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> This film, in short, is atrocious. The acting was bad, the plot was too elaborate and the humor was surprisingly very rude. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a rules breaker and a future sheriff. When their mother has to go to work, she asks Ms. Kwan to look after her children. Maybe the only fun part of the movie is when Ms. Kwan is looking at a Taiwan court room at C-SPAN. She falls asleep quickly and here is the cat. <br /> <br /> The film begins to get out of hand. The cat came to let the kids have fun. He has Things 1 and 2, which suddenly start ransacking the house. He improvises a TV infomercial and accidentally cuts himself off. And when the cat goes deep Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. His only fun disguise is probably that of a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn the children of the cat. <br /> <br /> Too bad he did not warn us that this film was as much fun as fermented milk or that it cut your tail. <br /> Soon, the kids are out looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate in his collar. If the cash is not locked soon, their house will host the world of the cat. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is globally horrible. Mike Meyers brings to the cat his irreverent humor, Austin Powers, saying things like "You dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after getting hurt testicles by doing pass for a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as Conrad, who causes problems, and Dakota Fanning, adorable, as Sally, although they are not enough on their own to save this horrible aortic dissection waiting for John's death. Ritter (an imminent accident). Lawrence Quinn, Alec Baldwin's talented player, is disgusting and is still trying to seduce his son's mother, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. These last three are equally bland. <br /> <br /> Overall, if I were a parent, I would not take my kids who love potty humor, because there are so many and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. As the late Dr. Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Really, universal, stop! Theodore is already turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says: "Curiosity has killed the cat" .- Cat in hat * on *****
