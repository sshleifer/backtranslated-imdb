"Darkness" was amusing to a certain extent, but there never seemed to be a plot, it lacked more than other films accused of this harm; that is, "bad taste". It started really well, with a man running away from something. It was very scary for those first minutes, but after a while, the movie became fun on the gore map, which was hard to understand at times due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting, which most of the time looked like friends chatting with a video camera and forming alignments as they went. This, without any plot, gave the impression that the film had been started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As mentioned before, the gore was the only interesting point of this film, hard to pin down most of the time.
