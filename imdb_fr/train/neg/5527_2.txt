The revolt of the zombies is BAD. There is nothing distracting about the movie. He is dull, lifeless, misinterpreted and poorly written. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, and this film gives Dracula a roller coaster look. The 65 minutes of the race seemed to be 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of control of the mind by "zombification". A man finds the secret and uses it to marry the woman he loves. Once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control, causing horrific consequences. That's all. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> During most of the film, I was trying to find out where I saw the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had a lot of time to think about that. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies revolt", it struck me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as a general at White Christmas. This is how I "enjoyed myself" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of filming compared to this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I have already seen worse.)
