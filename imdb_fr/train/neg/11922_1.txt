A so-called illegal asylum seeker goes to Stuttgart and finds that the Germans are "racist". <br /> <br /> This is just another steam nugget already forgotten in a long list of anti-German propaganda films from the Second World War, whose aim is to get the Germans to feel "bad" not to welcome all the degenerates of their country. he can drive out German blondes and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for good German films in general, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola rennt." <br /> <br /> But not that . <br /> <br /> In addition, "Das Experiment" with the same actor of "Lola rennt".
