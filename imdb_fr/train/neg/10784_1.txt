It was disgusting and painful. What a loss of a casting! I swear the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. It is not a lie. Do not rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too mean to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. Everything is fine. I felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people would remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was like she always was. Charming and sweet, but without purpose. The "romance" with John was completely incredible.
