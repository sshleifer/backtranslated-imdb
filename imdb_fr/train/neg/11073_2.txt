It is terribly bad and extremely embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is one of the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one is not particularly bad. This is particularly typical and generally bad, filmed in 2-bit hotels and thin-headed public parks, high-level actor and "uh ... we see what this button does on the camera ??" photography. If Michael Moriarity was so determined to do an imitation of Jack Nicholson, could not he at least have done an imitation of GOOD Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, really one of the most beautiful cities in the world and also a yacht construction center (part of the "plot"), why in the name of God let it be left behind? endemic Canadian inferiority dictating its hiding in Seattle ??? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than a little ashamed. Australians are doing wonderful things. We produce pretentious second class tickets. Gawd !!!!!
