The situation is more and more serious, the series is falling. The first two suites were acceptable and since then we've seen a lot of really, really terrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can not play. Alice, after surviving the previous opus of the Nightmare series, discovers that the mortal dreams of Freddy Krueger resume again. This time, the insulting murderer crosses the sleeping spirit of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be reborn" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is her dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, miss the next three, and watch the last one.
