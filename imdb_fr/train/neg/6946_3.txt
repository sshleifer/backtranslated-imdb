I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years ago) and I liked it afterwards. I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. The second time was not nice. The game of actors is "so, so," the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The acting game ... I'm sure the actresses did not have a lot of trouble playing these characters. The plot ... it is impossible that these women escaped with the first flight and even less the second. (Side note: Why did TT not realize that even if she brought a large sum of money for her court appointment, they would ask her where she would have been and she would not have any money. logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a crook!). It is horribly stereotypical that black women say in essence that the only way for black women to "beat the system" or get a large sum of money is to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. He plays too much on sympathy because they all die at the end (except Jada) but it's not sad (you think "they were so stupid, they deserve to die). You do not really care about characters unless you are a superficial person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film exceeds a 5.
