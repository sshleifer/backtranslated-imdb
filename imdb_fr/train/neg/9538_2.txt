When I saw the ad for that, I really wanted to see it. Now, forgive me, but it's been so long since I have not seen it that I do not remember how it happened. Suffice to say that the film I saw does not look like the "film" on which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed by this movie. And if it was not serious enough, they had to plunge it even further with this horrible reggae music. No real ambient music for a horror movie, huh? I guess if you've never seen the ad (or the trailer, I guess), you might think it's a hot topic. For my money, advertising was much better.
