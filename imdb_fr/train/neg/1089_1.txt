What's up with Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Was he saving light? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time with anything made by Altman: it's a pretentious waste of film.
