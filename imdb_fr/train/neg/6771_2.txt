There is little uplifting stuff to say about this, but I can mention that Matt Dillon did his best to create something from scratch and the many divided screens and graphics that are worth it. As most racing movies suffer from the assumption that car enthusiasts are not as smart, we end up with movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who so surprised Mean Girls, must make better decisions about the roles to play. . Here, it can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only be moderately entertained as they try to attract more adults than children (even if they are still stupid enough). Those of the theater with whom I saw him showed no interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports film, it's horrible. The best moments are, at first, scrapped, creating a feeling, and later, at the car festival, a tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you need to develop it better than here. After a few obligatory race scenes, you're in the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
