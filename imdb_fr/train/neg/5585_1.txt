The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist who kidnapped two pygmies and took them to Scotland, before realizing that they are neither animals nor subhumans, but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who were kidnapped, treated like animals and yet who are given a role as stereotyped as superficial in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he "manages" to establish relations with the pygmies ... No idea of ​​what the two hostages feel, from their point of view, their calvary ... I think it is is a superficial film, with a fundamentally racist unilateral vision ... he never manages to get away from the sight of "white men"
