Please! Do not waste money on this movie. This is really nothing more than a boring German scam made by high school students. I could not finish watching this movie and I usually like to watch all kinds of B movies. How on earth could they find a distributor? !!! It's funny though: check Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely crazy. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. The money that should have been spent on actors, camera and editing. Even that would not have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, "dark zone" has already attracted too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, stop making movies like that ... you're not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
