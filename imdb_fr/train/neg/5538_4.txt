It's not really a zombie movie, if we define zombies as walking dead. Here, the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by an incredibly young Dean Jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, although in reality, his "method" is to mentally project his thoughts and control the spirit of other living beings to turn them into hypnotized slaves. . This is an interesting concept for a film, directed much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of 'Dr. Mabuse 'films, including' Dr. Mabuse the Player '(1922) and' The Testament of Mr Mabuse '(1933) He is unfortunately here subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc√©e, Claire Duvall ( played by Anne Heche with a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone) which is really the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing start, while Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the In a certain type of complex (where we have big ensembles and clothes), he announces his engagement to Claire, and barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring his love for his friend Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland) It's unintentionally funny how they talk to each other without looking each other in the eye.This would have been a good movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000, if they had not already roasted. <br /> <br /> We never showed how Louque actually learns the secret of "zombification", but then uses it to kill his enemies, creating a huge army of rifles carrying soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such force of will before John Agar in "The Brain of the Planet Arous" (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry her if he will let Greyson live and return to America. Louque accepts, but makes him one of his hypnotized slaves. On their wedding night, he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his "powers". To win his love, he does so, causing the "revolt" of the title, in which all his slaves wake up and attack his compound and kill him. Greyson kisses Claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable: "Those whom the gods would destroy would make them mad." <br /> <br /> So, really, it's not so bad that a movie, despite the low IMDb rating it currently has. During repeated viewing (?), We can see the artistic talent of the well-formed script! Dean Jagger had yet to become a good actor and he is almost unrecognizable in his youth - is it really his own hair? We remember him more for his roles as bald old men in "White Christmas" (1954), "X The Unknown" (1956) and "King Creole" (1958). The story borrows much of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers, the previous movie "White Zombie" (1932) in which the unfortunate Robert Frazier (Charles Beaumont) uses the "zombification" to win the love of Madge Bellamy (Madeline Parker) <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (there are hundreds!), I'll start with "White Zombie" (1932), "The King of the Zombies" (1941), "J ' walked with a zombie "(1943)," The Night of the Living Dead "(1968)," The Last Man on Earth "(1964) and his two remakes. In the modern era of classic movies, there is "Horror Express" (1972), "The Snake and the Rainbow" (1988), "28 Days Later" (2002) and its sequel, as well as than many other works. many to mention. <br /> <br /> This one is not really a zombie movie. Judging by this movie, it's more like a semi-Gothic romance. As such, it ranks a little below some of the horror B movies of the late '30s and early' 40s. So, I'm going to give it a 5.
