I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At the time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong. He was the director of this movie and Jenna was the sexiest porn star of all time. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as possible by making this big-budget porn movie. Now, I know why they are no longer making big budget porn movies. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but it's the real world and they can not act. That's why there are pornstars, so if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could act, she would have tried to turn to mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beauty does not make you a movie star. Traci Lords is a good example. When she was a teenager, she was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in the world. She made her debut in low-budget mainstream films and could not act. Where is she now? I gave her a 2 instead of 1 just because Jenna is so hot, but she made better movies than she did "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk, as much as we want to see you make love. Plus, Jenna, you would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you did anal film.
