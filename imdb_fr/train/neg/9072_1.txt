This film has no plot and no focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a stupid comedy, but the writers have no idea what the film's content is. Even the title does not go with the movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them! The roommate character (from That 70's Show) was the only person to watch. She was hilarious and stole all the scenes she was in. Others need to make sure that their own university degrees are in place because they will need a career other than acting.
