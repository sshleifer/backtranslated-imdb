First of all, I must say that I loved the Animal Farm book. I read it with my Grade 9 class and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and misses many of the main points of the book. He jumps a lot and explains nothing in detail. If someone watched this movie without having read it first, it would be confusing. The most disappointing thing in this movie was the end. The end in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and the men in an alliance and some kind of "fusion" together, but instead, the film gave the impression that the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To summarize, I do not think this film captured the true meaning that Orwell described in his book.
