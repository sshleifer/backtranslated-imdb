We bought this film in a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration because we had already bought the film No Big Deal and had it redone. <br /> <br /> We expected this film to be a great source of inspiration for us to redo and put on the tube. However, it was shocking. BORING is the word that comes to mind. The bad effects and the script are not enough to make you look. The main body of the woman seems to be whipped at the opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, you may be wondering if the budget has prevented her from undressing? If yes, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a homemade movie, the plans do not even match each other and the work of the camera is so amateurish that our remakes of bad movies have a professional look. I can not believe that this is sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> IT'S VERY BORING and UGLY to watch. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
