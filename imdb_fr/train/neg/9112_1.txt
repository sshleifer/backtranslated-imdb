Basically, the Cruel Intentions 2 are the Cruel Intentions 1, again, they are very poorly done. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some lines), with a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and certainly less talented. Instead of being attractive and attracting me to watch it, I ended up feeling dirty because it's like watching a soft-core porn. I'm not sure I have to blame some of the silly lines on actors or writers ... wasted time of my life. It literally surprises me that some movies are shot and that's no exception ... I can not believe they would make a third one.
