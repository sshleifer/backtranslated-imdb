Back in 1985, I caught this thing (I can not even call it a movie) on the cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging uncontrollably. I understood very early that it was hopeless. Stupid scenario (a group of old guys who hire young people to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even he got bored after 30 minutes. Remember - he was a high school boy! It was back before nudity was so easy to get through the internet and the like. We kept looking in the hope of finding something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funniest thing about this is the original advertising campaign in which the studio admitted that this movie was crap! (A poster had a fictional criticism that said, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead has shown talent and has actually made a career in the business. T & a without budget and boring. Jump.
