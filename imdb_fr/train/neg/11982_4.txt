In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (under the name of Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (under the name of Lizzie Praskins) oversaw the wedding of their children, Anita Page (under the name of Helen) and Norman Foster ( under the name of John). Before the celebration, Mrs. Dressler entrusted the reins of her small bank to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression led to numerous bank closures and financial insecurity. The banker Foster is able to survive through the careful planning of his mother Dressler. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune and is demanding a complete withdrawal. Other "Warren Bank" clients hear Moran's speech and begin to question their own creditworthiness. Soon, the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> The immense critical and financial success of Emma Dressler, "Emma", was published at the beginning of the year. MGM must have wanted to release a new Dressler film as soon as possible. as possible. The success of Dressler in 1931, "Reducing" and "Politics" still yielded a lot of money. and, Dressler became the # 1 American Box Office Star in 1932, according to Quigley Publications' list of industry standards. "Prosperity" has certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but production seems unusually sloppy and hasty. The casting is doing well, considering. A little more care in the direction and editing, and a few times, would have helped ?? apparently, they needed it in theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
