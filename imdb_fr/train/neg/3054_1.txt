The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all other monitoring agencies around the world should watch this film to get information on how to spy on people. (As the comment of MST3k says ... "Sanata has mud on everyone! Santa's tentacles reach far and wide the world! One can not hide from the Klaus organization") miles to ears that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa Claus on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... it's so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is huge. Very small budget but so much fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You can even laugh at the misfortune of good children. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 for the production quality and a 10 for the pure cheese and factor of pleasure.
