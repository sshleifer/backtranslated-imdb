I did not know at all what the film looked like before seeing it because Tashan had only trailers during his promotion. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said, "This is Vijay Krishna Acharya's first film that wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 & 2 and the son of Saif Ali Khan. , Ibrahim, makes his debut in the film by playing a child in his flashback. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I understood why their trailer was not an appropriate trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old can come up with a better story. There was virtually no action and the camera was shaking at every possible angle and it's hard to know who is killing who. Also, the action was stupid and unrealistic, for example 1 man with a handgun was able to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> As I watched Tashan, it reminded me of 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: The terrible English of Anil Kapoor, like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: Outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a joke. <br /> <I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2, there is absolutely no chance you will love Tashan. The race was fast and it's a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both are shot in Greece in good places, but what is the use of garbage film? Even the terrible English of Anil Kapoor could not save this confusion.
