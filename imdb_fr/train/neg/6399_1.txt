One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics transformed into saps for a bratty kid. They both sold themselves in this one, worse than Pryor's character. Two: A horrible and too sentimental scenario that could have been used in such a clich√©d Harold Lloyd film. Three: choice of a black actor as a toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as never before. There is no message here, the role of Pryor could have been played by any comic actor. Four: This kid ... I wish I could go back in time and stop him from playing ... that would mean that movies like this and Kid Co. might not have been shot ... and my childhood would have been free of their power distorting the spirit. So, if you want to watch two great comics get dirty in a nice children's movie, go for it. If you want to see them in something good, see the old act of Pryor and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.
