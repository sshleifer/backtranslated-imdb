Yes, I know it's a cheap film, but this film is a great example of how a collection of "depth" signifiers (political turmoil, love / lust) can be randomly combined with a great critical acclaim (see also "American beauty"). Kaufman's film accompanies free sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialogues (in one scene, I counted three different generic European accents affected by the actors) and state displays could go crazy, without the bind together in a coherent meditation. Kundera offered. and in three hours, he manages to almost completely hide Franz, the fourth missing element of the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel, which is to display the spectrum of emotions and relationships of power who get in love relationships. nor does it include the screen time for the son of tomas, used in the novel to illustrate some of the political arguments that kundera made in the novel. combined with the exaggerated soundtrack, these flaws make the three hours of this film unbearably heavy in tone and yet light in content.
