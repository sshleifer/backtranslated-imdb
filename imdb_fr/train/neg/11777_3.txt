Years ago, I saw The Godfather and it impressed me. The atmosphere of the film was first class, memorable acting and scenario, a classic. Recently, I bought the trilogy and, after watching Part 1 again, I can not wait to watch Part 2 ...... I was so happy to realize from the beginning of the game 2 that it was appropriate to follow the movie of the great godfather, again was almost perfect and I could not wait to see the Godfather III ......... FALSE !, I would have liked to be able to stop at II. The scenario was not good, it seemed to me to be a story invented just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the girl. Pacino's protege was a weak character who would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then, scenes such as, Corleone being invested with everything that resembled the Catholic church with a complete choir, the assassin on horseback in the setting sun, the invisible Ram shots across a board, pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffs treats with a helicopter machine during the meeting (where the "gifts" escape and where everything the world is slaughtered), orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency?) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will of the world, I will not be able to look at it anymore. But I will look 1 & 2 several times over the years.
