Well, I guess the good news about William Winckler's 2001 opus, "The Double-D Avenger," is that he manages to bring together three mammal wonders of Russ Meyer - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven of the Cross - in one photo. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing ... or managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and it is abundant), is that this film - if it is even possible to say that it was shot directly on video - is a complete failure, a total abortion, a total atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly l one of the worst images I have ever seen. Look no further for the most lamentable superhero movie ever! The plot here, as it stands, deals with Kitten's superpower gains after shelling his rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure his breast cancer (oy), and then fought against a trio of megalalon bikini dancers. his return to Los Angeles. the joke has completely fallen (you should forgive the expression) flat, there is no nudity in the film (other than some old photos of Kitten at its peak), and shaving cream and a pad of paper chewed are the sum total of the special effects. Meyer's girls here are a bit long in the tooth / sagging in the chest, to put it mildly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as a bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Succeeds in distinguishing herself well. So, why did I give this juvenile teenager, not funny and missed a 2 star movie instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voiceover commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he extracts about 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from more than 1,000 listed on his site's "Canonical Hooters List" Web. Man is a national treasure and he manages to turn this disk into a coaster status!
