I own this movie. Not by choice, I do it. I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. So I put it in the old VCR and spent an hour and a half in my life shouting "Why God why?" The scenario was not so bad, as a player, I could enjoy a bit. I think maybe if you like the romantic scenes super geeky cheese, you will enjoy this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan like Dr.Spock ... unable to love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really awful. But if you're really ready to make a movie, this is the one for you !!! The real story is however much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this film in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> BLADE
