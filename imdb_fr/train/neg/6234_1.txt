Even Goebbels could not have achieved a propaganda feat like what Gore did with this complete fiction. It's a study of how numbers and statistics can be combined to tell you everything you've predetermined. The "scientists," said Gore, said social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists were experts in the field. Would you say that a meteorologist is an expert in neurosurgery? Geologists in field research and data analysis do not support Gores' alarming claims about global warming. As one of those geologists working in the field for 40 years, I have not seen any evidence in favor of global warming. My analysis of this film and Gores' actions over the last two years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant. No more no less. Ask any alarmist or "reporter" of global warming a simple question: you say that global warming is a major problem. Tell me. What temperature is the Earth supposed to be?
