Race car drivers say 100 mph seems fast until you've driven 150 and 150 mph seems fast until you drive 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog seems weirdly breathless until you see Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems to take your breath away until you see Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten seems breathtaking until you see the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Fans racing, there is nothing in the film world like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> The ghost of Alabama is as close as one of his films to a coherent plot, and it's all about hippies. , rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinationals, elephants and Mystery Gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, which sails in the Sunset District in San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> What is really amazing is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the Alabama ghost. There are sets, lights, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots of effects. In a way, this makes the ghost of Alabama SO WRONG. You're looking at awful cheese balls like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some of the strangeness is excusable on the grounds that they were making the film out of the room on their Discover cards. But the ghost of Alabama was created with a real budget, and it's BAD. I mean, I have a scenario about a cannibal tribe living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods with Twizzlers, and no one is knocking on my door with a checkbook. How did this man get the money? FOUR of the most flamboyant films ever made?
