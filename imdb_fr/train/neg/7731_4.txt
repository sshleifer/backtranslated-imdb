The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be a little horrified to discover an American-style musical - a clumsy and scalded dialogue with inexplicable numbers of songs and dances. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so mediocre that a dreaded dubbing job was substituted for it (you'll remember, dubbing was almost perfectly successful in Umbrellas). The French translation (for subtitled versions) also leaves something to be desired, although this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also features several moments of self-awareness that seem confusing, such as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the suits - well, the combination of skinny pants / white boots and the oddly artificial colors, are reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer by referring to umbrellas; Note, for example, the suitcase worn by Maxence when leaving Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that Guy when leaving Cherbourg. Also note the "Practical Guide of the brunette" - Madeleine in umbrellas and Josette in girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect the natural sensation of umbrellas (saving the scene of the floating bike) or who are looking for the deeper questions and ambiguous terminations as in the Umbrella script should probably pass this one by y. Those looking for a French version of a slender 60s American musical will be very happy.
