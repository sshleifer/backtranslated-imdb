Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida. Where he meets a little penquin, he tries to save an Eskimo. This short is trying and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a little too light in the laughter. Eskimo is not that great for Bugs and I have seen much better Bugs Bunny cartoons, even for other short ones when paired with other unknown antagonists. So, I can not in all conscience recommend this one. However, it is nice to see it in its raw form. This caricature is on disc 3 of the "Golden Looney Tunes Collection, Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My note: C
