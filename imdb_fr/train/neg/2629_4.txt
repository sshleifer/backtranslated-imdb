Hollow Point is a movie worthy of a half price rental or if nothing else makes you waste time without thinking of anything. There are the necessary explosions and the role play and the pretty ladies. A very good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast and a light touch make this movie an excellent movie, but fun .. on a scale of one to ten ..a 4
