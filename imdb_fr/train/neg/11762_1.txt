As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone has been paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers of the original mini Shaka Zulu, this "addition" to the series is appalling! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a big role in the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film, however, is nothing but rubbish, scratched at the bottom of the barrel by a writer who has failed to impress since the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, rescuing drowned slaves with his red buoy and his whitened smile? <br /> <br /> I did not expect blonde and busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red swimsuit for no apparent reason. It would not have been more strange than the fantastic plot imagined after a pint of beer at a disguised party, where the costume of a caveman prompted the writer to return to an African theme for his next " blockbuster". .
