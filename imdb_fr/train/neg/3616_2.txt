If you just watch the cover of this movie, it's cool. DO NOT. The film itself made me sleepy. The pace was slow, the violence minimal and the suspense little used. The role was to play with the background and the plot, although it would have been cool for a different film, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only nice character in the whole movie! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot in the end. Other than that, you may want to save yourself from this movie trash.
