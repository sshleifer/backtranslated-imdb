In THE FAN, Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see that the problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and, unfortunately, the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it a bit hard to believe that Fox would have started as a fervent sports enthusiast obsessed with frustration and become a stupid <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The arc of character is not the only problem in this scenario. It also lacks a focus on the character (a problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up being slightly flat), during several parts of the film, I always thought that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story goes back to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who seem to think that it should have been a little more focused on baseball. I do not know if it was originally intended to appeal to baseball fans, but again, there is some evidence that producers could decide if and to whom and on what history should be. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was entertained by THE FAN (especially the soundtrack), but it's a very flawed movie and you have to remember that in the mid-1990s , the characters were tracked by crazy as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY, etc. Steam a long time ago
