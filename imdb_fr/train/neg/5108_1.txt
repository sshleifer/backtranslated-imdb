I can not help but laugh at people who tout this show as comforting and heartbreaking. On the one hand, it is quite unrealistic for these people to lead a perfect life after their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to maintain these new mega-homes? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must surely increase after that. In addition, the noise would annoy me. <br /> <br /> Second, how much can a reality show become excessive? It's pretty much the same thing week after week. We meet a family suffering, she renovates the house, then surprises the family and everyone breaks Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how much the renovation part is boring. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by false confessions and constant sobs. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show claiming to be sincere but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like reality TV, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
