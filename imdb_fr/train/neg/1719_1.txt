The Crater Lake Monster is without a doubt one of the most horrible and hilarious movies I have ever seen. He ranks high with Manos, The Hands of Destiny, in terms of a mediocre actor, useless direction, and production values ​​at the kindergarten level. In this film, a dinosaur with idyllic animation and stop-motion wakes up after a meteor hit a lake in Bumblebum, California, and begins eating on local hay beans. At the height of its heyday, the creature, described by a resident of the place as "a giant alligator with fins," drags his heavy weight on the ground to chase his future lunch, before a bulldozer hits him. twice and dies of boredom. Every character in this movie is a complete fool. A useless side plot shows a booby at an alcohol store to buy a pint of $ 4.75 from Ripple; instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots at the cashier and another spectator, pulls a cop, is pursued to the lake, all so that he can be eaten by the monster. The unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal that it is nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There is a fake magician struggling with a bogus British accent (to make it look more legitimate), two overflowing redneck boat owners, a "prehistoric rock art" done in pencil and a banjo-pickin background disturbing. In a painful scene, the fake wizard and his wife, his girlfriend and his accomplice managed to add 4 more minutes to the film by explaining how they can see stars in the night sky, even if it is clear day. Even in constant fast forward, this movie hurts, and hurts. MooCow says to call the fumigators, because this cow pie really stinks! : = 8P
