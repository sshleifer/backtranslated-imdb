At first glance at the slogan of the plot, I thought it might have been a decent movie. Have I ever been wrong? The beginning of the film gives the impression that many monsters have come together and decided to make a low-budget film. During the first 10 minutes, you will not notice the game of nerdy roles, the horrible sound and the terrible special effects, but it will only get worse. After just 20 minutes, I wondered, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask this question when I was not crazy about laughing at the lameness of this movie. The main actor has only one frame for the emotions and he keeps it throughout the film, even if he was supposed to suffer love, hatred and everything in between. The flashback scene almost made me throw up because it made me relive a minute of extra film from earlier in the film. We are now in the middle of the film, where they are obviously trying to remove Morpheus from "The Matrix", although it is just doing a horrible job. Talking about the "Star Wars" actor and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie, because you really think the plot is finally developing. The character of "Morpheus" dies, the only good thing about the movie. He pronounces a few words and the credits. What is it? No plot, bad acting, all nerdy, it could not be worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
