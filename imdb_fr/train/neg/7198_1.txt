After the animated film of George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this film. Major disappointment. Thread the naked plot, bad action, bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners, a silly (and useless) product placement and the most boring side kick in this gadget car deal. I took two young children to see him and they were bored. The only laugh received from this movie was a bad wait when you need to laugh: show him a guy who receives him in the groin!
