It's amazing to the extent that he manages to be terrible on so many levels. The scenario, the acting, the staging and the choice of casting are appalling. The costumes, the sets and the pseudo-medieval language are quite awful. Strangely, I really enjoyed this movie, once I accepted that it was not going to be good. It seems unfortunate that people spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when in fact they could have done something decent enough (but not really believable!), Story about dragons and knights, which lacks all the charm found in other films of this genre. Let's hope Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. That done!
