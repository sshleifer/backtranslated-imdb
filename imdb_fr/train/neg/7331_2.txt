this film was clearly badly done and in a hurry. I realize that funding for such a movie is hard to come by. However, if the plot had any substance originally, someone could have found that it was receiving the necessary funds, this was not the case and films like this are not necessary and no have no reason to be. The plot for this movie was made and done better I could add, many times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance to compete with others. I was informed by my computer that I needed at least ten lines to submit my comment. The following lines are therefore only a bull to fill. In my opinion, there is no need to say anything else about this movie. what I said is full and if you lose enough time reading this review, do not waste more time watching this movie. The only exception to this rule is if you are the kind of person who likes to watch shitty movies that are broadcast on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 am. In this case, go ahead, see what I was looking for.
