I would have given this movie a 1 in 10 if there was no ms. The performance of Claudine Barretto. and I will take this time to forget that Kris Aquino is here. and ... end. <br /> <br /> I really DO NOT watch Pinoy horror movies because the stories lack originality and I really think (some) writers do not pay enough attention to the characters (and their progress ) in their movie. stories (redundant ??). it was like they were "pushing" the movie forward when their narration stank. and my kindness, creative exhaustion has led them to rip off other movies. Why?? why did this film have a good review? I would not give him that much credit. the film was a little scary, but the movie seemed stranger because it deals with Filipino folklore ... it enters my list of "events most likely to happen". I just wish they would spend more time improving the scenarios and correcting those backtracking sequences, no matter if the light is zero, no matter if the content takes you away .. SAYANG.
