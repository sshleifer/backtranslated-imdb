Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two essential things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE presents Gene Hackman as a prison convict to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents - they probably work for the government, but this, like most of the plot of the film, is never specified. Hackman asks a lot of questions that are never answered, so the film goes absolutely nowhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed but even that goes against it. Kramer's management is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny film! <br /> <br /> The acting is all right, Hackman proving that he's pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably naughty and Albert is well chosen to represent the cruel lackey of Widmark. Even the most heinous Mickey Rooney is very good as a Hackman sidekick. A quirk, however, is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We are told that she has served her time in prison and that she seems to be trying to pretend to be a sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of ​​making her appear as a basket is to make her wear a dirty brown wig. This role is best suited to people like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
