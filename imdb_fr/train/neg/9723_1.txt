Children's games or how the film was badly translated into English Love me if You Dare is a movie made by stupid people and stupid people. I just do not know how I could hope for something worthy of a movie with such a plot: Two stupid ignorant kids are betting that every one of them will do something (certainly extremely silly) to prove themselves (wtf? ) That they are "cool guys". I know I exaggerated some aspects, but that's the whole movie. They are getting older ... and instead of realizing that they are nothing more than a couple of crazed lunatics still playing their wildest roles, thinking they are exceptional people. <br /> <br /> but France? It is even more shocking to see the film of the country that created Amelie a few years ago, which the film tries to look like, but it is far, extremely remote. <br /> <br /> Avoid. To avoid. To avoid.
