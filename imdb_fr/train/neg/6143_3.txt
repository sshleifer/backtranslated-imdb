This is indeed a strange film ... First, a former American gymnast tries to become an actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he has ever had (that I know anyway) - and for good reason. Although he's pretty good at keeping an interest, it's a pretty bland and flat performance. Second, we have the worst sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I am not joking. That alone makes the film extremely comical, but in this annoying way. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally decent acting support cast (including the hot chick required!), a story actually not so bad, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, the scenes of combat involving gymnastics (hilarious!) and the general execution of the plot are weak. This film would have been hardly better as a network television movie (a pity that Fox was not there in 1985). It's one of those movies that's just bad, but you can not resist watching it and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home through the TV and cable are available late at night.
