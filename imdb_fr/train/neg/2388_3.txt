No one should ever try to fit a Tom Robbins book on screen. While the film is good and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well to read it, is nil when it is spoken. In other words, no one would suggest that hearing someone else's name means seeing it written in radium on a pearl. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks like a badly adapted cliff. Notes to the book - most parts have been reduced to one-fifth of their size, in terms of history and history, and the end is extremely different (and unpleasant) from that of the book. Most of the book's intrigues have been lost, including the one that makes sense at the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book that tells the viewer "Huh?" Unfortunately, the script should have been read, compared to the book, etched and all the actors sent to do something much better. I greatly admire Gus Van Sant, but even someone of his caliber could not make a decent film of such a complex book without a miniseries.
