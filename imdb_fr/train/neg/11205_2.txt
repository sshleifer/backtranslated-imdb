Yeah, well, I really regretted not giving up on my Saturday night watching this weird but very long movie. Apparently, the main character has not stolen two hours of my life either. Here is the incarnation of the antihero in "No Regrets". We have this fool, so confused, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unparalleled that it was extremely difficult to overcome the lure of a promising son of a highly favored businessman, Jaemin, unless it is simply: a physical attraction. He claims the opposite, that it is love. But after looking at it, it's like we love Charles Manson because we're digging a beard. (Okay, it's not so bad, but still no really recoverable features.) I could never go beyond the reason why Jaemin stems endless Sumin. It has never been shown, simply said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. It may be a matter of culture that has invaded me: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. That must be because a little more than half of the film is stalking the other and the last part comes and goes to the point that I thought it was turning into a ball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to appear. Ok, so Sumin works twice while going to school, until now, everything is fine for someone trying to improve. But after having tasted for the first time the attraction of his stalker, he abandons his daily work for a kind of prostitution network. What? OK, well, as mentioned before, the obsession does not stop because of the change of job / career and if you add a lot of other very angry characters, you get a movie messed up where incredible events seem to happen produce without accumulation. Basic movie, not 100% good, but you can do better with foreign movies on the theme of homosexuals.
