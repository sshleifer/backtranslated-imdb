The basic principle of this film is a political caricature. I guess for those who do not know the realities of the military, it's probably a film of "well-being" about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator said, "It allows women to know that they can do anything they want." What a trap! No one, man or woman, can do what they want, and unfortunately, Demi Moore took advantage of the BUD / S program at the beginning of the 27 weeks of the BUD / S program organized by SEAL Hell Week, but she does not wish to SEAL not going just do not do that. The most difficult military training program is about 80%. These are those who give up voluntarily, who can not compete physically, who often suffer physical injuries during training or who do not support psychological problems. harassment. I have never exceeded the lack of depth of the alleged artificial message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not last the first 24 hours of this hard and sustained physical training. Wishing alone will not do it. Spend this film as wishful thinking, and spend your time reading Dick Couch's "The Warrior Elite" (Crown, New York 2001) for a more in-depth description of what's really going on in this workout. Ring the bell, Half! <br /> <br />
