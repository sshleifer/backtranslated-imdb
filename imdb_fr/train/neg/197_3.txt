While being a great James Arness western, this film has been called the worst Alamo film. The story was terrible, inaccurate all along, and just plain truths! Continuity was thrown to the four winds. Someone caught the gun sequence? The Mexicans had the stupidity to shoot with guns whose mud and chopsticks were still clogged. Come on! Then there is the ridiculous hat of Brian Keith! The customer must be away or something. Or just out of their minds!
