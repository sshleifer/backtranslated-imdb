OK .... I just have 3 words - cheese, cheese and cheese! Dean Cain is the only feature that redeems this movie. Apart from that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has something promising in the concept - an underground lab creates a real fire-breathing dragon - giving us basically more "Jurassic Park" "Reign of Fire" ..... It there are great possibilities, but they simply do not follow .... The special effects are correct - even if you know that the dragon is a CGI, it does not look terribly like CGI .... <br /> < I would not blame Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), I would be more in charge of Phillip Roth - the director and scriptwriter. It's his job to make this movie .... and unfortunately he failed.
