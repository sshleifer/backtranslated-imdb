I can not believe how horrible this film was. I feel magnanimous even talking about "film". The acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many important questions unanswered. The premise was OK, if it was not original: a small group of foreigners living in the United States and trying to slowly take over humanity. But it goes down quickly from there. How could they convince a "human" to accept a stranger as a bride in order to make it a foreign-human hybrid that they need? They show a larval alien but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon capable of producing a perfect-looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw the huge extraterrestrial monster mandatory with teeth. The end was almost too painful to watch. I guess I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has something to do with it. How could he tell the huge alien monster with teeth: "Get away from him, son of a boy" with an impassive face? It is a long fall of Babylon 5 days. Avoid that at all costs.
