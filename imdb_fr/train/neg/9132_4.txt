The Fuendish plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice at the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if it had been done the right way, it could have been handled properly, but on the contrary, it would have been badly executed. One of the reasons this film has not been so good is its mediocre dialogue, its cheap laughter, its jerky staging and its annoying feeling that the film is somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> The acting game, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed picture. I found that Sellers brilliantly described the evil Manchu, with occasional aftershocks that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused who is the henchman in which he says "Ah, you all look like me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed at this reply. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of very strong secondary characters really caught my attention, especially with Helen Mirren as a dotted policeman, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (his latest film also, not a way to end a career), and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather fanciful performance of Al Capone's parent who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching. <br /> <br /> The sets were also nice. Oriental conceptions and English society of 1933 have been elegantly portrayed in this idiot. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I would advise you to watch the movie if you are Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar Fan. Otherwise, you'd better just chew aluminum foil.
