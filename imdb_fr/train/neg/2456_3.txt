I saw this film in an acting class on Tolkien's theme during my sophomore year. Unfortunately, I was sitting near the screen and my teacher chose me to serve as a whip. Everyone was laughing, but they were not constantly in plain view. <br /> <br /> Move away: Peter Jackson's films 'The Lord of the Rings' owe something to the movie Bakshi. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which the Black Riders assail the empty hostel beds is almost a true copy of Bakshi's movie scene filmed and filmed. You can call it a plagiarism or a tribute, according to your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I will not do any research to find out what they are, because that would mean that I have a little respect for this movie. I'm sure others have described the similarities - look around you. <br /> <br /> This film is a real train wreck in every sense of metaphor and many people died in the accident. I decided to list what I remember more or less chronologically. If I failed to mention something else that offended me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed, confronted with a profusion of failures (and, at the high points, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to intensive use of rotoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a gentle and wise wizard, but a fearful prophet of misfortune (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice) during the film). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes called "Aruman" during the film, without explanation. He wears purple and red for a mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is hideous. The portrait of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are as small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin are never presented - they just appear at a scene change with an explanation in one sentence. The film is full of sloppy montages like this one. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing happily as they pass the road. One of the hobbits gets a lute at least twice as big as his back - which was not visible before - and begins to scratch in a phantasmagorical way as they all broke in "la-la-la". AWFUL. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotyped fancy dress (without trousers), with a huge square buckle of pilgrim's belt. He's arguably the worst swordsman in the whole movie - he's often swept away before he gets knocked out. <br /> <br /> * Black Riders look more like lepers than threatening instruments of evil. They limped wherever they went at a painfully slow pace. It is disturbing, certainly, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders attempts to cross the Ford Bruinen (in which they fix Frodo, who is on the other on horseback) continues forever, period during which the riders raise their horses in a vaguely menacing way and ... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate the hallucinatory decline of Frodo who succumbed to his injury. It turns out to be more painful than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is as tall as Legolas the Elf. He's a dwarf. There is simply no excuse for that. He also looks like a bastard David the gnome. It is a crude but precise description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have stolen the golden golden armor of Elmer Fudd from this episode of the opera Bugs Bunny. He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog induces a howl and is the least threatening villain of the entire film. It looks like someone is wearing pink slippers, and it's barely bigger than Gandalf. The "purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day. <br /> <br /> * Battle scenes are embarrassing and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters demonstrated any level of skill in arming. I do not ask for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they're supposed to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I was sorry he took the trouble to show himself. all. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All right, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the dubbing is very good. It's not that bad that sounds like Aragorn, he looks just like the green giant jolly. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is rather interesting in this representation; like Tom Bombadil, she seems insensitive to the temptation powers of the Ring and her actress voice is not horrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as Jackson's portrayal of the same scene, but it's still dramatic (and more faithful to his death in the book, even if I do not think Jackson made a mistake in shooting him like he did). <br /> <br /> * As my teacher pointed out (between muttered threats), the orcs (mostly at Helm's Deep, if I'm not mistaken) look like the corpses of war-ravaged soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what you are trying to do. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not really a positive point about the film, Bakshi can not be held responsible for most of the failures of this film, or at least said - the project had a tight budget and late in production, he lost creative control for the benefit of some of the most senior (who, I'm sure, had not read the books). <br /> <br /> Let's be clear: I respect Bakshi even for attempting somet hing of this magnitude. I just can not believe he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy, even for laughter, unless you have already read the books and have never visualized characters, places and events. I'm sure someone somewhere will take a copy of it in confusion; If you do, keep an open mind and glean what you can get out of it.
