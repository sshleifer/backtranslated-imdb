I watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling on it by zapping some chains. <br /> <br /> I guess we both hoped for a kind of happy and family-friendly Christmas film, but were extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> actor playing the soldier, seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever, his face is the same, whether to shoot down a Christmas tree, see the girl he likes to be kissed by her boyfriend or when he is pleasantly surprised by the girl he loves, he is a frightful actor, and at no bridge do any of us laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the pretty blonde girl, with the ability to count points and cheat with her boyfriend, what a catch! and his ambition in life is to live with his parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a story about a guy without emotion or feelings who falls in love with a guy who counts the points and cheats on his boyfriend, it's as predictable as it can look, and really a waste of time, you do not win anything by looking at that, except for some strange laughter, because everything is so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I love when his father says that he only eats fries and not French wine, and everyone laughs, it is the attitude of the hill that makes you think of this movie. Moreover, if my friend, my father, was watching me as if I was telling him something, but not our Veteran army, no sir, he let everyone lead him. <br /> <br /> The film is what First Blood would have been, if John Rambo had been burned as the biggest wimp in the world.
