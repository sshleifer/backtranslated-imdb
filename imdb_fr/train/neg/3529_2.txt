I heard that this movie was much more stylistic than the director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Cannons, Snatch) had realized before, the problem is that it is perhaps too stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years alone. Two years later, he is betting a lot of his money. He is ready to take revenge on the violent casino owner who sent Jake to jail, Dorothy 'Mr. From Macha (Ray Liotta). Along the way, the doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live because he is dying of a rare blood disease, oh, and Masha is beating him. Ready Sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) ask Jake to pay their money back and do some odd jobs for them. The movie is filled with Jake telling through flashbacks, and in his last three days before arriving at the big revelation about Zach, Avi and Macha, well, I guess that's what it was. Terence Maynard as Frenchman Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that involve a bit of animation, repeat lines twice in different perspectives and change speed over time. These are irritating to the point of causing confusion and boredom, making it a silly policeman drama. Pretty poor!
