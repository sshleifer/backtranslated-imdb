For some reason, various young couples walking in the Italian Alps are separating to see who can reach their camping designation first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds the skeleton of a former demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the movie running through the woods looking for his friends and cutting off their limbs to add some stew to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This digitized Full Moon output is stupid, insane, its game is terrible and the sound (Los) National Forest is a mediocre substitute for Italy. However, he is quite high on the scale of involuntary laughter, mainly because of the saturated performance of the lead. Whether it's cheap armor, wielding a sword or neurotic gibberish in Latin about demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and delicate lines must be seen. Oh well, at least he is not boring like most other actors.
