This film is an indulgent junk. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the nice soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but it is not - it's just irritating. The characters are difficult to maintain and the acting is mediocre. The stories contained in the film are also charming and sinister. I was expecting a heartwarming family film, but it did not appeal to my 14-year-old daughter either. It's rare that I can not see a film until it's done, but this one was right of both of us. <br /> <br /> Even though the film takes place in the current period, it has the look and feel of a cheap East. European film made during the Cold War. There is not even enough beautiful scenery and Scottish cinematography to redeem it. It's a shame because, as a film, it's a nuisance for Scotland.
