The first part of the film was rather nice but towards the end, it became commonplace. Although Turturro is an actor I usually like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad impression of Rain Man and the representation of genius in semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall, it seems that this film is too hard and ends up seeming pompous despite good performance.
