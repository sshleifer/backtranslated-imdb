"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsivity. Probably a movie marketing scam, this movie is an elegant shoot with a good cast and nothing else for it. In conclusion, "Journal ..." would have us believe that our sex-addicted character has the most stupid woman in the world, a stable of girls on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim, and no work despite the job of restaurateur. At best, this film could have been a good drama. At worst, softcore cheap. "Diary ..." is not either and nowhere in between. This one for the dumpster. (RE-)
