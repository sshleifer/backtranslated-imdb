Down to Earth tells the story of Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance recovers the body of Charles Wellington, a white man. So Lance does some things in Charles's body. The film has some laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the animated comedy of 2005, is better. It's a good movie, but Chris Rock did a lot better than that. This will make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really funny. You will laugh at yourself and you can laugh, but you will certainly not ride on the floor laughing.
