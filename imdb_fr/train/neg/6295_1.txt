Suffice to say that, despite the strange ridiculous panegyric of his so-called "abilities" posted here, the director of this idiot, heinous, has never made a film since. Well, that's great news for me. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but lacks the spirit and technical skills that make the novelist Martin Amis readable. <Br /> <br /> When will the UK film industry wake up and realize that if they want to regain the status they had before, they should stop producing garbage like this and do something real that people will really want to watch? <br /> /> Avoid like the plague.
