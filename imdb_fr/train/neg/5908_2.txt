This one is a little better than the first one. He still relies heavily on his humor, which keeps repeating that Bond's old movies were unrealistic. It wears out after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this one. <br /> <br /> There is a huge amount of disgusting total humor. Let's hope that someday the real comedy will come back.
