I saw a lot of bad movies. Most of the time, I can enjoy a shitty horror movie for what it is. But it really hurts new extremes. <br /> <br /> It's bland, the plot for what it is is never really going and takes its time on it. There is no shock, no horror, no suspense, just a load of guys scrubbing for an hour and a half then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A plague on the horrible kind, to be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br />
