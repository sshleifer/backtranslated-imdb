If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, be it a boy. But get ready by bringing your HP if it comes with a radio. <br /> <br /> After watching such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it's awful to see what's happening in Indonesia again. It seems like the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to be seriously working on Indonesia's image in the entertainment world. Whether it is a "global" world does not seem to be evoked by those who make cinema in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with a Western twist, they are doing well. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is nice to start. And that could have become a nice movie. But has the director never thought that a musical needs first live music OR at least a good reproduction, and then a good choreography? In this movie, the reading is so bad that it makes you want to cry at the movies. Every actor you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sings in playback, which is extremely annoying when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they had planned to make a film about morning gymnastics, but in the end, I thought it would be nice to make it a musical ... They have only forgotten to change the choreography. Hard to dance you see, they jump here and there, throw their legs in the air, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending .... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a good candlelit dinner is much more romantic, THEN!
