Be warned! <br /> <br /> It's shit that other shits do not even deign to be in the company of because they're under them! Ok, eliminate it, let me tell you something more substantial. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time a long time ago thinking it was a new interpretation of the material, which is based on a venerated tome of a novel because of the new reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Still, WKW failed to adapt the novel to the screen according to many wuxia fans; most of the time they are just splashing water, drops of sweat, horse legs, etc. I could not sit for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many years later, I move quickly. Wong's films are another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. His last film, 2046, intrigued me. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I was fooled by losing my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional critics have mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a big modern city, blah, blah, blah. Everything is fine if the director has a point of view on what is happening and how to say it. But no, it just shows what is. The acting of Faye Wong is very typical of the Hong Kong style: deformed saying, deer in the look of the lighthouses, try to be a cute and rather feminine actor; the rest of the cast is also devoid of inspiration. <br /> <br /> I think the word Author is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which must be applauded, but not one who has not done it yet. yet mastered the art of cinematic narration, what Mr. Wong has been for 17 years!
