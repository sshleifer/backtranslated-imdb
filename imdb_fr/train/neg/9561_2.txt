As many others have commented here before me, I must say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct reference to movie intrigues or sequences in this comment because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I feel like watching an episode of a TV show or something like that where they took the lead. extra money to spend on CGI (I've seen worse) ... In short, it's an insult to the viewer, at least if you have knowledge of computers and / or technology. . There are too many insults to put me at ease, and I found myself begging for everything to finish - quickly - halfway through. In addition, there are countless scenarios of "easy solutions", which is also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... <br /> <br /> This film fades in front of the old "Wargames", and I think it's a pity they even called it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars of me, for one thing and one thing only: the performances of the actors are not half bad, considering the regurgitated shit of a script with which they had to work. Yet they should never have signed for this film. It's not really a career change, but I guess we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have given the film the highest score ... you have to be on the studio payroll or something like that. my only explanation. <br /> <br /> To all who have not seen this one: listen to it well and decide. But lower your expectations on the ground (and even to some).
