I found it difficult to get through this movie. The soundtrack was not the best and some accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to advance the plot and often, the action simply stopped and there was a long period of conversations that seemed foreign to the film. These conversations tilted between the family groups and the observer was instructed to try to understand the link that united them. I rarely notice a film as low as I do in this case, because the entire viewing experience let me think "so, what" and "why did I waste my time looking at that".
