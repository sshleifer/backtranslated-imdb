This film proves that good acting comes from the right direction and that it does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but he is young. Donald Sutherland appears as an amateur. Why? Because the scenario is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors look bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would end and I turned it off halfway. The director did a very bad job and even if I did not read the novel, it's a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film tries to evoke and the message and scenario never reach the public. In a word, it's a horrible movie.
