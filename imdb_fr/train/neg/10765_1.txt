A wonderful example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a literary fiction masterpiece and smear it stupidly. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Big Sky", the writer Dudley Nichols and his company arrogantly assumed could enhance a pioneering classic novel by award-winning author Pulitzer, AB Guthrie. In doing so, they removed the soul of the story and any impact or impact that it could have had as a cinematic adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of his main character, Boone Caudill, from a young Kentucky naive to a hardened and competent survivor / mountain man, he was replaced by a small river boat farce hardly resembling the intention of the author. In the film version, Boone's presence is disappointing. <br /> <br /> Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie its innovative impact and enthusiasm have been removed for no apparent reason. Most surprising of all is the emphasis on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a minor and accidental character in the book, occupying only a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, has completely disappeared !!! It is also obvious that director Hawks decided that Zeb's character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, was not irritating enough. So, Zeb / Hunnicutt has had plenty of time to make this odious, voiceover narrative, which is the Hollywood shortcut for incompetent writing, editing and screen making. <br /> <br /> Some movies have actually improved the books they were based on (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is a great example). But it's horrible and depressing, not only as an adaptation of a novel, but also as a film. <br /> <br /> The story is dull and clich√©, as well as the characters - at least those that have not been edited. of the script - are only superficial and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, the star role of Kirk Douglas, which could have contributed to the success of this film, was sabotaged by the role of milktoast entrusted to him. <br /> <br /> If you can convince yourself, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer Prize laureate The sequel, "The Way West", also featuring Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further reinforces Howard Hawks' place among the most tarnished and overrated directors in film history.
