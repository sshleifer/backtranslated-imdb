I've been learning Zodiac for four years now. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anyone ... In fact, among most people who know, read and learn about Z, I'm the one with the least knowledge ... But I know or at least, I think I know that most of the things going on in there would not happen ... the way he signed his name ... the way he killed people. .. I thought Godfather was the worst film of all time ... The cinematography was that of a five year old ... without saying that my films are better but I'm not someone who makes movies for the mass population ... <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was pretty good, but I do not forget it and I do not know because I stopped watching ... his voiceovers were good. ... But I really spend four dollars and 70 cents for something else ... like a big pizza or something ... <br /> <br /> Until what I learn to write a Critique, Psycho Phil
