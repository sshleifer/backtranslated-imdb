What is this? A zombie movie produced in Canada that I had never heard of before. A funeral director is working on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows an extended flashback that shows how the guy got there. By and large, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and gathered the dead with his idiotic songs. Back to the morgue where our corpse comes back to life and kills the man of death and the owner (who has his eyes blown out). The final WTF? the shot at the owner of the funeral home in a jacket straight and shouting: "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, he has his eyes on his back. <br /> <br /> In the space of 58 minutes, this is certainly a quirk at the zombie cinema. It's been a lot longer, but put me in a sort of trance where I could not stop looking. The film also has one of those gags "if you see this picture, move away from the screen". This is the image of an old man falling ill in a theater (prophetic?) And when he appears (only twice), the blood begins to flow. The scenes are damn bloody for the period. There is a big blunder in which a zombie cuts a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chew, it's a left hand.
