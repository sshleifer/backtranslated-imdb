Since "Rugrats" has moved from the category of funny cartoon series to mediocre and even horrible dishes for two-year-olds over the last three or four years, the tyrants of Klasky-Csupo should obviously not ideas. After crushing all the characters, added new characters even more stupid, replaced some voices (although I love Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), And having no sense of continuity (for example, in an episode of Kimi, I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each have a new puppy, but the next episode (the aforementioned dogs never appear), one would think that the creators could kill the series to get mercy, but noooo. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this special is that it sucks! Although not as horrible as the episodes of Kimi, everyone is still more stupid than he was, including Grandfather (God, he was the best character in the series, but now he has no real purpose) .The end is unnecessarily mellow, and the only difference between this episode and other new episodes (98-1991) is that the fants can interact with adults. Whoa, what a pleasure! <br /> <br /> No stars at all for "The Razmokers grew up". Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show before it gets worse.
