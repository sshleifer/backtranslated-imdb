OK, the film is good but I give it a 1 because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. That kind of shit just adds to the paranoiac delusions of this foolish scholar that a computer is just like an organic virus. First, code strings and tens of 1s and 0s add to computer viruses. An organic virus is much more complex, even though it is much smaller. Although considered one of the simplest forms of the universe, organic viruses bind to your cells and attach to RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like this could be treated from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has an effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into a virus? I could see it, but obviously the author did not think about it.
