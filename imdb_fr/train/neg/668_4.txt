So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big fan and I was scared to see this movie at first, but after seeing it, it's not a horror or a thriller. <br /> <br /> I mocked the movie for me because it was so predictable. You can predict what would happen next. The young actors played their characters well, but I must say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will give props for the plot, because it was good, but it is neither exciting nor scary. There was almost no scene of "jump in your seat". So, do not waste ten dollars watching it in theaters, wait for the DVD.
