It was not remarkable enough to be really horrible, it was incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was horrible. <br /> <br /> For starters, it was too fast for us to be emotionally involved in what was going on. It was just arduous. The dialogue was so sparkling, flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, completely wrinkled, made Deadpool boring. How do you make Deadpool boring? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just a boring guy with a few swords that he did not even know how to use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telekenisis so that the cards float and fly, or super strength to jump hundreds of feet in the air? And what was happening with all the stupid helicopter movements? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist in the field of physics. A round stick is not a helicopter blade, you can not fly twirling very fast. What Gambit could not do anyway. Neither Deadpool, especially when used to replace a real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film is proof that working with sons should only be used by combat coordinators who know the world they practice and know it better than ever. use it in each. unique. stroke. replacing real combat choreographies. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical combat Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson) and some of the worst combat choreography I have ever seen in the memory of recent movies. It was as if the stunt coordinator shrugged his shoulders and left the special effects guys behind. <br /> <br /> And then you had the exit, with all those mutants who did nothing. Even the mutants that had been shown to have powers in their cells (that's good to see a nod from Quicksilver), did it when they came out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-that-movie-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when is Logan so beautiful? And the stupid, "The ball will take his memory away." Do not you think Xavier and the X-Men would have noticed the huge bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they X-rayed him? I felt sorry for the man Liev Schrieber, he actually has a good Sabretooth considering the script. He made one of Marvel's simplest super villains believe that he was real. But he could not save the movie from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was the level of "Daredevil". Decent history, good actors, absolutely horrible performance.
