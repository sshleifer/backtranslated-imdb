The entire film is composed of flashbacks of Boogeyman's first film and, inexplicably, sequences from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love's Brainwaves film. It is framed by more recent images (from the early 90's anyway) boring, misinterpreted and inexpensive. Not only is the movie flashbacks almost completely, but they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the movie. So you see recycled images again and again, as if you had not seen them before. As if the originals were not enough. I've never seen a film so stuffed ... Someone was shooting the last dollar from these movies. Total scam. And talk about padding ... why do I have to write 10 lines on this trash? If I can say it's garbage on 2 lines, that should be enough.
