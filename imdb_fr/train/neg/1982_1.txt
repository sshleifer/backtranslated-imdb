Who? What? Or? When? Why? The game was terrible. Very robotic, repeated. I saw all the actors of this film in better roles. The scenario was very basic. At the end of this film, the scenario was linked. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be attached. So that he never tries to write / direct another film.
