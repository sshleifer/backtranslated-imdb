The first mistake you make when you're filming is to use "undead" without really having a budget for the real effects of zombies. Of course, it was a low-budget zombie movie - a very small budget. I thought it was a movie school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It was really not bad considering the above and it brought an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you want to get an "R" for violence, you can also give us good shots of the attacked girls. The women were so little used in this film that one could almost classify it in the category "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And I stay out of Oakland. There was a lot of shooting and no cops!
