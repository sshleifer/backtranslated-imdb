I was expecting a bad movie and I had a bad movie. But I could not really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is. It's not a matter of surfing on the blood, but a big crocodile $$. They complain about the false shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here, the crocodile is shown often, and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, look at Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a movie worthy of surf / shark, but he had to make a bad movie of b-monster. He was lucky enough to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this film is, does it have good roles? Not really, there is nudity, and a sex scene straight out of a playboy movie. The acting is not bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she does not remove it. The main actors are not bad either. They had potential. The location was beautiful and the movie starts well with some nice surf scenes. The fault lies with the screenwriter and director without talent. The dialogue is among the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director has no talent, no more than a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Watch the mermaids watch Kate naked and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks naked and Kate (but she's a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have did a good job with the piece of sh # t that they had to work with.
