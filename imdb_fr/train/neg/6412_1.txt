I just got back from the movie and I'm completely dismayed. This film is an absolute mockery for all humanity. The theater I was in maybe with 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person loved him. I can not believe any sensible human would like. There was no plot NO GROUNDS AT ALL. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about anything? This film only shows why Hollywood is in such a state. I can only watch the spiral of the industry of "horror film" and laugh. What a parody for all the filming, this is true of all the new series of "horror movies for teenagers" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw. It's such a trash. Do not support this kind of crap!
