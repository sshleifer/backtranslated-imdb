A shaky hand held camera was used, probably to give the film a documentary aspect, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to have motion sickness just by looking at it. It seemed like a person with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense should be offended for PC patients, but I do not think you'd expect to have a lot of work as a director of photography! ). The camera was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and I considered it unassailable and gave up after 10 minutes of torture. I checked a little later (it was broadcast on TV) and nothing had improved. I suggest dropping this one unless you need to get rid of all the bad sushi you could eat!
