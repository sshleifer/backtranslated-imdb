When I saw some excerpts from that movie, I thought maybe it was silly, but at least it would be funny. Well I was wrong. Even if somewhere at the bottom the producers had an interesting message to convey about the fact that the parents were left alone and reevaluated their lives, the way they were trying to convey it was horrible. The first fifty times something stupid happened to the couple was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict what a stupid incident was going to happen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was mediocre at best, which is more than I can say for the film itself -even.
