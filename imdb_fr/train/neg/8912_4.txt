Dark Rising is your typical horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has a strange, unexplained plot with holes so big that you could slip an elephant into it. Most of the time, I did not know what was happening, but it did not matter, it was a simple demon hunter coming back from hell to save the campers' story by adding confused elements about witches and a book evil elements of the plot and characters that have no meaning or disappear totally without reason. I guess the acting is bad but honestly, they can not do much with this scenario. There are some topless scenes that are probably the only reason this bad movie was done (like so many other bad movies). Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on T.V.
