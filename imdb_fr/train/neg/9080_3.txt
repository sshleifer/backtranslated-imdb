Well, I just ordered this at home on the pay-TV because I was bored and I needed to laugh. I must admit that I've been laughing a few times, but I do not even remember their respective roles. I do not understand why this movie was done. It claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a singing penis, nor a very funny 70 year old naked woman. This film was trying to fit into the "crude" comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it failed miserably. It was way too rude so it was comedy. And why did Cameron Diaz associate her name with this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and nice and well done. In addition to this, avoid this movie. 3/10
