A nightmarish film with an extremely tight budget, which has illusions of grandeur. Hard to sit. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow great revelation. I had no idea it was wrong before watching this. Yes it's sarcasm. DO NOT look at this "film" if you are offended by the nudity of the masculine or feminine gender. DO NOT watch if you are in the least. DO NOT watch if you care to act. On reflection, just DO NOT look at the period. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: make the film, the premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie photos, director's commentary, 2 versions of the trailer, video of The Azoic and video experience in class
