the writing of the reporters and the overly demanding and reckless press officer and the sobbing grandmother were closed with hard fists and clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors, but someone has surely said, "Are you kidding? say this!" <br /> <br /> This episode had a point of view press and police, while the police point of view was pretty standard, it was exaggerated and overly exaggerated and sometimes incredibly unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I notice it was a co-production of HBO. If so, the stereotypes of the sledgehammer can be explained in this way, <br /> <br /> I was completely angry during the press conference. it lacked credibility and did not sound remotely. 40 minutes after the beginning of the first episode, I'm still waiting for the suspense. <br /> <br /> Spend five days. the production of 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more moving even if the crime is extreme. <br /> <br /> This story has had unforgettable moments that can only be described as incredibly incredible. <br /> <In order for a press officer to start a press conference in the absence of an investigator, he will answer questions from the press. <br /> <br /> so incredible that it sounded like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> I then started looking for the journalists called "Scoop" and for Perry White for his appearance. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 Hunter before "five days" reached Australia, not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer walking around again. <br /> <br /> The head is shaking.
