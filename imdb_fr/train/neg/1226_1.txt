My, how powerful have fallen. Kim Basinger is an excellent actress, but she was really falling asleep when she took on this role. This film is bad for one reason in particular: the failures of logic. It looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its holes in the plot if it had been released in the '80s and' 90s, but in 2008, it looks really stupid. It's the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The story of Della (Kim Basinger) is just starting to buy gifts at a mall and is being harassed by a gang of thugs who end up killing a cop who has come to his aid. From then on, she is pursued by these fools in an abandoned street and she eliminates them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said, this film goes beyond logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is bad for television. Damn, this pseudo thriller is made for television. The way she kills each of these politically correct hooligans (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African-American all reunited to hunt down a white woman ... Do not you just love America?) Is laughable . The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main thug was so in the left field that it makes you shake your head with shame. I recommend it only to fans of bad movies and no one else. All the others, especially Kim Basinger fans, would do well not to own this movie. You do not want to see an actress you respect in a movie as bad now, do you? Of course not. You have been warned.
