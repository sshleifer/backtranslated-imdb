Bonfires of the Vanities is a film soaked in sweat on the flop. I remember all the films that have made so much effort to be so relentlessly scandalous, provocative and important, but have failed so consistently in all areas. It's like a cartoon that does not laugh, but can not leave the scene. The more the film tries hard, the more each attempt to laugh sounds like a thud. The desperation displayed by the film is so blatant that it almost arouses pity for all concerned. <br /> <br /> The film only reaches its status of laughing out loud twice. Once, Geraldo Rivera embodies a hateful, arrogant and amoral television tabloid journalist - which is funny only because he apparently does not realize he is playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be mocked is that of the film's final "big moment", during which the judge interpreted by Morgan Freeman delivers the divine speech on morality ("This is what your mother taught you. ! "). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, it must be admitted that it is a noble effort. There is a good group of actors, although misinterpreted, trying to make characters with thin cartoons. The film has a professional rendering and the small cinematographic scenes that the director Brian DePalma adores are obvious, even particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to comment on modern morals and ethics, never goes beyond the level of cartoon. Satire needs style. Stuffing requires energy. Even the sitcom takes time. But the best bonfires can gather is despair. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
