This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. That says a lot, considering some of the choices I made in movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I got it on netflix, entirely based on the fact that someone with whom I attended high school is topless. The naked breasts lasted about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having punge sticks under my toenails while listening to Roseanne singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile humor in the bathroom and gags in the locker room, and it's such a flagrant (and poor) scam of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you will ask Big Jim Slade to cross the wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of garbage .
