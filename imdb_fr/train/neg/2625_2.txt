This film is horribly played, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy that it's actually half-visible. It's SEMI watchable. <br /> <br /> The scenario (the little that there is) makes practically no sense. The character of Barney Drum is the only real comic relief of the film and he is tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Most Canadian actors are featured in television commercials. None of them have been followed by anything else I know. And of course, Sly Stallone's less talented brother played well ... = = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was shot almost entirely in and around the small village of Claremont, Ontario. (about 20 miles northeast of Toronto), I recognized many landmarks / intersections / local buildings. I think the drive-in scene was shot at the "Oshawa Drive-in", now demolished just before it was demolished.
