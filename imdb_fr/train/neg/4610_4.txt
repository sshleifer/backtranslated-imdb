I watched this movie because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to be able to prove it because she is still in this kind of low budget movie B. She is always beautiful and she always tries to act on the unfortunate material in which I always see it. It's no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Wendt played against the guy, and it was so shocking that he was recognized for his role. Another note about Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have fallen sharply since I saw her for the last time. Perhaps a reduction surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. This is not a bad thing. She always looks great. I would like to see it in a better movie.
