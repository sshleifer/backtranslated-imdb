My wife and I just finished this film and I arrived at IMDb to share with our critics who found this film less than satisfying. However, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a few are negative. I think this film is a great concept that went terribly wrong and I want to warn those looking to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I recognize that I am more inspired to write about not like a movie than when I do it, so my few critics are all negative. This does not mean that I do not like watching a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews that I appreciate. <br /> <br /> Paris I love you is the most pretentious movie I've seen in years. By using a "smart" concept and associating great talents with many short stories, the film ends in the worst of all worlds. It's art for art, but it's something a 2-year-old could imagine and accomplish. Giving the director a free 5 minute talk proves the division of labor, even in entertainment. The directors can not write, the writers can not direct. (I would also like to add that Clint Eastwood is overestimated, but it's because he's an actor who turns the role of director (which only rarely works)). <br /> <br /> mess of news that makes no sense, are not finished in 5 minutes and in total, spoil Paris for me Why call this Paris I love you when a title more appropriate is the group f * ck? Some stories can only be watched , especially that of Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but all the rest will fall in the shade.The Coen brothers' short film is passable, but can you name one of their films that does not contain a scene with a guitar pick? is as if all the administrators had decided to do what they wanted and chose Paris to do it.As we all love Paris, including the current company, we are blinded by the fact that this movie cries. think they put the names of the directors on each of the short because the filmmakers have seen how bad the film is and have decided to make sure that they are only blamed for their 5 minutes. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you people who simply play or regurgitate performances of other movies? I'm looking at Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria full of grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment on the actors' game: I give Nick Nolte double bravo for his interpretation and appearance more human than ever. Find her short film on youtube because her 5 minutes are very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Writing news is very difficult and only a few authors have understood. I am thinking in particular of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever. It's a lot harder than writing a complete novel and only real talent can accomplish that. The same can be said of short films. It seems that only one director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you consider Paris as a jewel to discover and reflect through your own goals with your own story, do not expect to enjoy this movie at all. The managers did not care or were lazy. In both cases, by the time you read this, it means that you rented it. Praise be that you did not pay $ 10 per head in theaters for that.
