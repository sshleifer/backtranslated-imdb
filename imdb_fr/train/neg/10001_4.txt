This film lacked something I could not put my finger on at first: the charisma on the part of the main actress. This inevitably resulted in a lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her main man. Even the romantic scenes appeared as simple actors. It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just do not know <br /> <br /> But could that be the scenario? Just who was the love chief? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and his restaurant, and finally of himself and his juvenile exploits than anyone else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed by this movie. But do not forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
