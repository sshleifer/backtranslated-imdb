This is a scam from the old Frankenstein premise. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a bizarre accident and his father, a renowned brain surgeon, rescues the brain. It is then placed in a robotic body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the impulse of the "colossus" to transfer thoughts in motion. The whole project goes wrong when the creation is unleashed. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is missing. And it's funny that it's not a bit scary. Well, very young kids will think it's good. If you are awake at three in the morning and it happens ... night, night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the "Colossus".
