Usually, I write only movie reviews that I hate or really like. And, as you can probably see from the number of stars, I did not like that. Now, I guess you've read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's describe this, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The concept: The premise has been designed to be interesting. Using the chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, this has not been done so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the theory of chaos was a bit distorted. The event in the film was more like an artificial coincidence than anything else. I guess the butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God causes the tsunami to bring back the statue." The presentation turns out to be really sloppy. Some people call it smart, but it seems like another action packed movie. <br /> <br /> Scenario: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just reunited to give him an excuse to play? ten roles? The plot is extremely artificial; Govind was losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents (his friend just mixed the vial with a package he was sending to India, a crazy old lady threw the flask into an idol, half of the distribution happens so unexpectedly in the same hospital, and the case of the idol just got confused with a character belonging to a famous singer.) <br /> <br /> CGI: My God, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects of Jaws 3, and those were bad. Right away, I could say which parts were animated. Even my 10-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look like this. <br /> <br /> Waterfalls: Yes, I now have the action scenes in Tamil movies are unrealistic, but the waterfalls of it were horrible and distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I must admit they did a better job than expected. I thought that Kamal would play with people with the same skin, so the two fake white men and the fake Japanese man from Aikido caught me off guard. However, it was still quite serious, I could easily say which ones were wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music was entertaining and moved in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: His character was perhaps the most annoying of the film. She was noisy, ditsy and obsessed with this irrational irration. In fact, I thought I was hoping she would die. <br /> <br /> Trace holes and logic of the fridge: let me understand everything: a lab monkey was smart enough to pass the door locked by a password, but not enough to tell the difference between a chocolate bar and a vial containing a deadly virus. And then, a former CIA agent who is after the bottle understands he is heading to India. Instead of following him immediately, he first married a pole dancer. A well-known Punjabi singer with cancer settles in a small-town hospital in the Third World when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. In addition, he is shot in the throat. You would think he would be killed, but instead, the quick fix cleared his tumor. You read correctly, a bullet knocked the tumor out. <br /> <br /> Advantages ... Naidu's character: The only nice part of the movie was probably his comedy.
