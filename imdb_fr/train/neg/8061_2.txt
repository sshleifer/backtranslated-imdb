Let me start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I greatly respect his work. I wish he were in more movies showcasing his talent. That said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am almost entirely responsible for the bad scenario. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller was successful and Eliza Dushku is currently the girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors have really integrated the script and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. He had the twists you expect, but they just did not lead anywhere ... except to more confusion. I just found the end very anti-climatic, because it did not seem to make sense or really answer the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this film. a good review, but I can not. In all honesty, the only thing that scares you about this film is that you paid the price.
