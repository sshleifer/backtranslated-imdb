Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Virtually all the films in which it was made are the best. Now, George had absolutely nothing to do with this movie ..., but he already said something that describes the film to a T. I do not remember his exact words, but he basically said that great writing can save a bad action, but a great action can not save bad writing. Never has this little observation been as true as in "All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mom". <br /> <br /> The casting of the two roles was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) are not content to watch the parties, but they do an exceptional job of imitating the real deal (mannerisms and all). This film should be a lasting testimony of their talents. That said, this film falls flat when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITE. <br /> <br /> Apart from the initial dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (who was very "character") and a short gag involving a taxi, this film is an absolute chore to cross. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort has gone into the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why mom wants to kidnap the pretty British lady. What I want is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their replacements). Too much time on the screen has been devoted to the explanation of the plot or the not very funny side characters around which the plot turns. <br /> <br /> However, even if this movie was a joke, it would remain us with ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM N Â° 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call the slapstick "diluted". <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "diluted"? <br /> <br /> In the slapstick, a character is hurt in an exaggerated way for his comic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or how about Laurel & Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the slapstick "diluted" (as I define it), a character is slightly hurt or embarrassed, and the filmmakers play a comical effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe an illustration would be useful: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls and he hands it over. It's a classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "jewel", Ollie accidentally hits some people. They turn around, tell him to pay attention and continue on their happy path. It's not great. It's not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of that kind of jokes. It's like it's the daily bread of this movie. Screenwriters and directors take these boring moments and act as if they are supposed to be funny. Of course, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only minimize it. <br /> <br /> Long story short: the film just does not work because the script fails to capitalize on that of Pinchot. and Sartain's ability to imitate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes on a plot and lame jokes. To watch this film is to look at two excellent imitators who have not been given any material to work on. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but an amazing sleep aid. <br /> <br /> a lack and stick to the real deal (as long as you avoid "K Atoll" and "Be Big").
