I still have not seen all that. It works on the cable right now, and it seems like I can not do it. The main reason I'm interested is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton; he is a very good actor and he has always done a good job during his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that even though I've never been a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was probably the best in the industry in the sixties and seventies, and his plans for the international rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has very well translated their work on the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> It's a lame story. Children are asked to drive it, and even if they do a good job, it's hard to break your disbelief, especially when you have eight-year-old son of Brains, flying in T2, a huge haul of tons with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Wherever you look, you see a Ford logo. The product placement is well above here, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do it with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film with its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable ride. Just do not look too much at the machines that drag them. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I was finally able to see all this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is quite uniformly mediocre and, although the effects are quite good, the story of several viewings has become much more superficial. The excessive product placement for Ford is boring, and the kids as central characters squeak on the nerves that remain to me. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Look at the original show and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a tip to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Directors Guild. You can do better than that, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came pretty much in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible that an already lame film was worse, but it was. It was embarrassing to hurt. <br /> <br /> If it had been done directly, without children to the rescue, without jokes, it might have worked. As things stand, it's just another cherished childhood joy that has been ruined.
