I did not feel as if I had been raped as I did with CHRISTMAS ENCHANTÃ‰, but THE MAGIC WORLD OF BELLE is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, even if it's not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly, non-canonical, silly, and the writing is horribly bad. None of the stories work. They are not BATB characters that we liked at all, they are lots of people. I wanted to dissect it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because no one of his mind would take this trap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The Perfect Word" is a heavy and pondering study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" only works if you accept the fact that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is a nasty villain of James Bond and that Lumiere is an idiot of women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the group. The beast hates birds? Since when? Do not look at this shit - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is always a movie classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
