I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman may be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt to create suspense failed. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again", I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it did not spoil his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen on the way to most Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in movies like this. Duvall was once an excellent actor in some great films, though his best performance was not "Tender Mercies" but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
