I think it's a horribly produced and realized film. Benicio Del Toro should not work in film production, he should focus on his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed most of the idea of ​​the revolution, its ideals and especially the life of Che Guevara, etc. The camera is awful, as if someone with a 2-day work experience took pictures, the music is ... I do not know ... is there any music in the movie ??? ? I will not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It loses about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything ... I do not see how you can rate this movie with more than 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER ... DISASTER ... DISASTER Do not look please. Save yourself from this misery of "film"
