*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, really, and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see how well it looks like a script, but it's complicated, improbable and ultimately silly. I saw the false death end one mile away. Ren√© Z. works with a subscribed party, as does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I do not remember (who is not Chris Penn) is a great actor. Look at it if you are not smart enough to tell the difference between a movie so smart that you can not follow it, and so confusing that you can not understand it. See if you like the cheesy camera work that gives you seasickness. Look at it if you like to watch Tim Roth work with a hard-to-handle script. See if he arrives late at night for free. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
