I chose to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because he was selected for the prestigious Cannes Festival Competition section. I was surprised to see Cannes judge so bad. <br /> <br /> The film, according to some commentators, does not have too many shots, but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son, or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove his loyalty. There are some allusions to the contrasting Corleone threads in Copolla's "The Godfather" that seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of both is as distinct as that of chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This film is only recommended for violent addicts. There is no big cinema here. At best, it could be considered better than the usual production of Run Run Shaw for production values.
