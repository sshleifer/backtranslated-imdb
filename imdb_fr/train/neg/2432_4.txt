Not much to say about this one. A plot that you can almost tie in the first 10 minutes. Nothing wrong with this movie, very little action for an action movie. There was a chance to explore the emotions of the characters from time to time. If an action movie is the right kind to do it, I'm still undecided. Sniper is one of the easiest movies to watch without paying full attention because it has few twists and a direct plot. I was probably guilty of this, so with a second watch or with flawless attention, it could be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
