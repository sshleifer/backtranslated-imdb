I thought watching job videos on business compliance was tedious. This film went nowhere fast. What could have been a half-hour-old half-hour twilight episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of movie about people parking their car, a picture of a guy's pool (he really need to answer his phone), a dot-matrix printer doing his job, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow-lit control room repeating "T minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting was going to happen . That does not give you hope. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in personalities other than television, and it's hard to find anything good. And DO NOT get me started on music that was totally composed of a Tympani, large marine mammals and a microphone. This film is as close as I gave one for now, but it gets 2 because I was able to finish this cure of insomnia and that I did not have to leave in the middle. AVOID AT ANY COST.
