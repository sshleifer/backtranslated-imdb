<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some of the improbabilities, it was actually a pretty decent horror / monster movie. So, I'll first give a few good points: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially since she roamed through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes humans). - the action was relatively continuous and, after a modest start, I absorbed well in the scenario. - sorry to say I was looking for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, for the implausible things ** maybe spoilers **: - if you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD, would you want to load into his cave with a barrel of powder? cannon under the arm? Duh. - a female character with an American name, blond hair and an obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Huh? - a senior scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut off with a knife, and who is supposed to be born in Chicago and educated in the United States? - a military helicopter pilot doing the repairs himself, flying a huge transport helicopter without any other crew, and also relying on a sniper and a combat soldier? OKAY. Uh huh. I will not even mention that he gave 3 different call signs in 2 minutes when communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some of the 60s Japanese monster movies, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although of course the end leaves this opportunity wide open. Or maybe they'll hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> Still, I gave this movie a score of 4 out of 10. Add 2 if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
