This film is absolutely horrible, but it can still be hilarious sometimes, even if this humor is not at all intentional. <br /> <br /> The plot was beyond ridicule. I do not even think a 2-year-old would be convinced by the ridiculous idiocy that filmmakers have tried to split together in a story. However, on the plus side, some of the horribly dumb plot scraps provide a lot of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard!" The situation is getting worse (and even more funny), but I'm saving you. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually laughable. Most children's roles are rather cute, but not very believable. Annie, on the other hand, is rather awful. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but it's mostly a good thing. If they had tried to be credible, the film would have been even worse. Which is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you have overcome the overall sadness of the film, it remains in reality some exceptional moments of near-sadness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, although it's a boring disappointment when they get caught by the police. The butler character, although very minor, is a sunbeam that, almost, but never completely, passes through the shadows. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie really caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were some redeemable parts that made it almost observable without beginning an internal hemorrhage. Judged on its only good sides, the film would be about 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the film barely deserves a 1. So, I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> That's pretty generous, I would say.
