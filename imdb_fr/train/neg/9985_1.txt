Have I ever seen a more inept movie? I can think of many others who are equal to this one, but none can surpass it. The actors are all horrible stereotypes cluttered with flat dialogues. I am ashamed for all the people involved in the realization of this project. Each one carries an expression of fear that is not generated by the plot, but by the realization that this project could easily deny his career. Even Ms. Diaz's many charms do not provide enough reason to subject you to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that the Americans did not really understand. Look at the end result if you have to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you ...
