OK, people, honestly ... it must be one of the worst show biz movies ever, but I laughed at laughing (maybe that's why I liked that). Basically, everything is a matter of sex, sex and a way to get your personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major problem in this movie? If you have a soft spot for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing about the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) In the show and shine his wallet with his love of photos. A triple A for bad taste and pleasure!
