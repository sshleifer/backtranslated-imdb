It was by far the worst low budget horror movie I have ever seen. I am an open minded guy and I still love a good horror movie. In fact, when I rent movies, I'm looking in particular for underrated horror movies. They are always good to laugh, believe I know, I've seen a lot. But this movie was so terrible that it was not worth laughing. I thought I'd turn it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it, in the first place, the film crew has suck3d A $$. The intro was stupid, as was the end. The special and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, do NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
