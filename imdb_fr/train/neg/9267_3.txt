After the "Final Conflict" already disappointing, the series falls with this fourth entry very weak. At least the third film has tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while he is only repeating and copying the ideas of "Omen" (the animals are afraid of the Antichrist, the death of a man looks a lot like the death of a photographer in the first film). But what seemed exciting and creative looks stupid. And the little girl just looks like a spoiled kid.
