During the inexpensive filming of Crazy Fat Ethel II's early video, I wondered if it was the same movie as the one on the cover. Unfortunately, that was the case. The story itself is of a disconcerting simplicity. Ethel, a murderous maniac with an eating disorder, is released in a halfway house because of overcrowded hospitals. She is by far the healthiest resident while a man puts dead flies into each other's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the transition house employees with a chocolate bar after he has resorted to a cost-saving measure of feeding residents with dog food. Ethel takes her revenge by strangling him with a noose on the stairs and ... well, you see the idea. If all this sounds funny, it is not. This film was poorly done with inexpensive effects and an even worse action game. The characters are so wooden when they deliver their lines that they should stand in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the movie consists of flashbacks on Ethel's first film, Criminally Insane, which is not much better. A very bad effort.
