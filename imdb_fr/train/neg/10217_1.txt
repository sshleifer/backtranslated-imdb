A misinterpreted two-person comedy dramatically transforms into an unpardonable polemic against the Indians, with lousy special effects, over-exploitation of nudity, and ugly violence. It's as sincere as the handshake of a politician, as obvious as the talk of a car salesman, one of the worst films in the history of the universe. Absolute and absolute dreck.
