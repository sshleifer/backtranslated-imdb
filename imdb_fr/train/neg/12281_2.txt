Hearing such praise for this piece, I decided to watch it when I came across it by cable. I do not see how this would "elect" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject to be treated. I guess if you're interested in stories about women's private parts and their impact on their lives, then that's for you. Otherwise, it is rather dull and boring. If anything, I found it a bit degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who also looked at this and she thought it was horrible too. So, it's not just a guy who "does not understand".
