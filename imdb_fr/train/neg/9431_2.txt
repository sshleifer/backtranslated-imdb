Basic premise of the slasher film, 3 young women demolish their car and end up staying with a scary family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watch 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> An old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes to watch actors eat - YAWN Try to figure out what they are eating. .. OK, there may be a game to drink here ... yes - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK, I'm interested for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random assassinations and uninspired ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The end ... dude! this psychopath is bothered - why can not the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that's all - my advice - move quickly the last five minutes and look at it, then put something good in the reader - for me I go back to sleep.
