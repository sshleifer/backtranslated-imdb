I recently watched the first movie about the guinea pig, The Devil's Experiment, and I must admit I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film is invariably included in the list of the most "naughty" movies and I was expecting maybe more because of the hype. The truth is however, I do not evaluate it. <br /> <br /> If I had watched him believe that the opening text was true ("I found this tape ..."), I might have been a little disturbed, thinking that it was real. Even if I did not have the advantage of knowing that it was not real, I think I would have understood that it was not so. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is inflicted on her These are just not what they should be. She should scream like a banshee who is in pain. The fact that it is not means that it is obviously not real. I would not want to see it if it were real, but if it was more convincing in its game, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing touched me. at all until the scalpel in the hand. Hot oil, maggots and entrails just did not bother me. I do not say that I am "hard"; just that I could not suspend my disbelief, partly because of the inaction of the girl. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me wince a little, but the hammer in hand made the rubber hand look. And the final scene with the eye was still a little grimacing but nothing more. I did not want to look away and I did not feel nauseous either. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is twenty, or maybe I'm jaded. The truth is that I did not find this film disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that you would expect to see looping through as a modern art installation and as a character-scraping exercise. , history etc. and just by leaving the torture, it works at certain levels. As a troubling movie, it did not work at all. <br /> <br /> I watched the guinea pig with my wife, who is like "it's just a movie" and she wondered what all the noise was about. We have discussed why I watch these films and my reasons are many but include the desire to be touched by a movie. She said she did not think a movie could be convincing enough to disturb her and challenged me to do just that. I played her the Irreversible fire extinguisher scene and she was really upset. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I make sense. Otherwise, we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror. genre film that any movie to date that is disturbing.
