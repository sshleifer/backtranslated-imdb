Some have praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so, at least not for thinking adults. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests a real action movie debut that has hit someone like the kind of bullshit you can not sell to adults anymore. The "coaching staff" of many older adventure movies has been done long before (do you think: The Dirty Dozen_), but Atlantis is one of the worst movies of this motif. The characters are weak. Even the context in which each member evolves seems at best stored and awkward. A doctor / doctor, a tomboy mechanic whose father has always wanted sons, if we have not seen this before, we've already seen some quirks. The story of a companion, Vinny performed by Don Novello (father Guido Sarducci), has gone from florists to totally unconvincing demolitions. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young academic obsessed with Atlantis expressed by Michael J. Fox, has no depth for him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo, perched on one knee, while his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were skinny at best, the best part of _Atlantis_ was the Talent voice. The depth of Milo may not be thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke does not lose anything that James Garner has expressed. Although Rourke is a pretty military guy, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters simply by playing. Garner's vocal performance is the culmination. I'm sorry to say that the dying king of Leonard Nimoy is nothing but obligatory. In addition, Don Novello as an expert in demolition, Vinny Santorini, was also distinguished by one or two well-made and fun phrases - but I always loved Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> The computer animation was also well done. The background animation is. The animation of the character has not been so bad for Disney since the minimalism that led Don Bluth to the door. Character animation does not matter if the already flat characters do not look flatter. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say trivialized or banal. I'm not so sure. Any usable plot can be turned into something new with the appropriate treatment. Shakespeare was often based on a well-known story and plot and was only reputed to have applied a new coat of paint. So, treatment is the thing. And Atlantis obviously lacks that. <br /> <br /> I can not start getting into all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot break like string and the end does not make sense. To add to that, the script and animation are sprinkled with negligence. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. From the beginning, when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly transliterated and that the "Coast of Ireland "must read" Coast of Iceland ", we start to have problems. The scenario writers would need to know the British for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland", and completely ignore the older Latin term, Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know the Viking plot to call Greener Iceland and the icy island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making the question a misinterpreted letter, the authors have vowed to demand a runic version of English and a post-Roman date in the script. Since it was after the Atlantis sank into its underwater cave and without visible clues and less technology than Milo, the inscription was much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard's diary could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, otherwise it would not know anything about the cave or crystal lying "in the eye of the king". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology used by the Milo expedition, how on earth did anyone get caught by the Leviathan? So how could he find out about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantean? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require that the shepherd be written in Atlantean. So, there must be some kind of automatic writing. As no one in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal that transmit messages to the surface. It would have made more sense. But could also have been explained in the film: Milo could have discovered that this power called him all his life - appeared in dreams, etc. It had to be explored in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlanteans simply should not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects native Indo-Europeans to be able to converse in Europe, any more than the Romans would understand only difficult "c's" or their day to become French "ch" (pronounced as " sh ", not less!) <br /> <br /> 4. The current Atlanteans were still alive before the cataclysm - while apparently they could * read *, but they are now unable to read what they used or use similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. The Mass Illiteracy highlights a crucial flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. He seems suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Even if it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantean school systems that collapse towards the end and the lack of good fiction that brought down Atlantis illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate machines if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in - but ALL OF THIS ** DIFFERENTLY * * qualifies his father for deification !! The stupidity of Kashakim has almost erased his people from existence alone. He killed a bunch in the cataclysm, blocked progress (not much killed here, but he oversaw a huge slip in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone, if they were not boiled in the lava first because the Giant Robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> A flash of blue electricity should have destroyed the image of Kashakim, when Kida tried to join the image of his father in the circle of the GREAT kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to go through a gibberish book and find a page on a crystal - which he knew to be a crystal and not a stylized astrological or "astrological" phase. "Sun". <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it would still not explain how Rourke would have suffered because Milo read it in the book. Ripping the page - which held in Rourke's hand, although Milo apparently did not find any torn page sign in the book - was there only to warn the viewer that "something was not quite right well". Unless the word "crystal" has triggered alarms in Milo's head indicating that someone would try to rob him, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's simply a prefiguration with a thick head. <br /> <br /> 8. The "double cross" of the crew was not a change of character. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie followed Rourke from the beginning. However, the "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change and you had to be more motivated. Difficult to do with characters who have not been given anything to start. <br /> <br /> 9. Neglect a little as the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area whose sequence we see. It's liquid; it will not run on the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. The end STINKS! - and makes no sense except to appease the politically correct. With its restored power source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, which needs to be pampered. The guardians of giant robots and celestial cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they could. The technology is superior to ours and certainly until the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo must teach Atlanteans to read, for what? The idea is to leave their small culture silent and chastised, not to send it in hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe the plot of the lost world and the setting of the turn of the century should give me a clue that it's is more of a tribute to pulp. The failures I find with the film are in keeping with this idea. But I do not understand why I should pay to see thin characters and intrigues, simply because many novels have it too. And the pulp stories are part of the "shit, they can not sell any more adults," anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated and our dough must also grow. The Adventurers of the Lost Ark have lost nothing of their flesh and have avoided so much evil. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the film is nice, but when I think of the plot, it always seeps lower.
