No wonder Pamela Springsteen stopped playing to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have it behind a camera than in front of a camera. Although this film does not lack interesting elements (mules of hell, etc.), it is compensated by defects. On the one hand, Angela, the murderous counselor, seems to be about the same age as the campers. Having an older and more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to run most of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in an outdoor toilet is certainly original. But all in all, there are a ton of scariest and funnier movies to watch for an hour and a half.
