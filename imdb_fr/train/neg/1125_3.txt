I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that's how I heard about this movie, I do not really know if it was at the theater. I do not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those special after school. The acting game is OK, not great. The plot was a bit weak and the lines were pretty tacky. So the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh". I borrowed the movie from Jeremy. If I were in a movie rental location, I would go past this one and, after seeing it, I would not recommend it to anyone. college I also noticed that often when the children of the cities are portrayed, slang is used excessively or is simply outdated. Many times, I think that's what makes their characters amazing.
