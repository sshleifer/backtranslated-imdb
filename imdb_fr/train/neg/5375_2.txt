Having just watched this movie, I almost feel like I've lost 2 hours of my life, but I guess there's something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I had to rate it Like any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 highs, but if I classify it as an ind. low budget. movie, it can go up to 3 or 4. It's a movie that is supposed to be "complete" and without too many long boredom or time wasters. This film is not. But I guess a lot of independent films are aimed at showcasing the movie skills, and considering that, this movie presents some highlights. If I have to comment on what the filmmakers should bring with them to their next project, I guess the distorted sound effects have some quality. They also manage to create characters, but that brings me to what they should leave out in their next project, because building characters takes too much time, because it is usually irrelevant to the plot of the film. The long spaces of time devoted to walking should not be lost in the next project - what's the point? I guess this movie tries to be a bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie tries too much and too hard, and I guess it should have been reduced to a short film. I could easily find an hour of walk or a useless dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this film. The story should have been simpler. I know there is a mystery in this movie, but a surprise for the murderer is no mystery. The story behind the "mystery" hardly holds much attention during the film, leaving the final "point" as a quick and unsatisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I would like to say that this film was a nice try, but I can not. I hope the filmmakers will learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to learn on a bench by producing low budget movies, you do not have to look at this - not even too much, why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have already said, I am pretty sure that the many answers given to this film come from people involved in the film. This movie could not receive a "10" from an objective distance point of view.
