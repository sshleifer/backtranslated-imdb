In some ways, the concept behind the screenplay was a rather interesting mix of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. However, no element of this film was so obvious that it did not deserve long close-ups. I felt like I was struck in the head with the so-called mysterious explanation of the disease that kills people. <br /> <br /> The author seems to have simply lifted the clich√©s of other films to replace the writing of lines adapted to the real characters. The actors did not help things. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some sort of attraction, if only because it's an essential part of those stories. However, the editors did not work very hard to develop the chemistry. Of course, they are both attractive, but if they attract each other, the question remains open. <br /> <br /> Turner's trust in the character has grown far too quickly and for no reason. The character of Sabato is supposed to be a discredited doctor who seems unable to respect the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character in "Independence Day". Usually, this kind of character is supposed to demonstrate a talent or talent. The character of Sabato does not have one. He is Cassandra with just the madman and all the prophetic skills of an eight magic ball. He seems to be right by chance. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are comical. Each actor was really trying hard to demonstrate the pain. The symptoms looked like a bad impression, somehow to this 80's video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
