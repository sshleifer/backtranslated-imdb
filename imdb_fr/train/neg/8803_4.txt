I loved "Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it would be so funny, but alas, it was not. Some pieces are excellent though. I thought the sportsman, Field Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with other members of the press team was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he becomes stronger and finally embraces Burgundy, which is not recognized either. But overall, the story does not gel. This is a noble attempt, however, to recover the unused elements of the first film, including an entire conspiracy on allegedly quite benign terrorists, called "The Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has some fun lines, but this unused line of plot has good reason not to be used in the first movie. The extras on this disc are pretty good, the two best ones being the rehearsals filmed with a lot of improvised comedies, and the fake commentary of Will Ferrell and an "executive producer", which Ferrell discovered early on, was not even part of it. of the film. anyway, shape or form. It turns out he's "just a guy" who walked into the side door of the recording studio and claimed to be a producer. It's quite funny though and lasts about 10 or 15 minutes
