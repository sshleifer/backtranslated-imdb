Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a cop, which is his dream forever. But his luck changes when he has a crush on the car (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After that moment, he unconsciously begins to adopt crazy behaviors and becomes the best cop possible. By the time he realizes the changes and his animal instinct begins to take over his human side. In the meantime, he finds a lovely girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to control himself and behave in a civilized way. I do not have much fun with Rob Schneider. In fact, it's the first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See her role in Ally Mcbeal, pretty funny actually). In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer less intelligent. I'm sure this film is acceptable to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously. But very sad to see such films doing very well at the box office. The Animal is not the worst film I've seen so far, but it does not get more than *.
