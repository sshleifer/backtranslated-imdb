Quite simply: the film is boring. The clich√© on the snapshot is confirmed and the stories never come together. It seems that the director does not know if he has to make a film or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill a petroleum prince, gets caught then warns the prince (why?)) And so some elements have been added to make the film more interesting. Thus, a child dies, resulting in the father's "natural" response: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and the guard, nobody knows it. Some children become suicide bombers and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not understand, I did not have to learn more or defend a cause. It did not mean anything to me, which to me is the worst thing you can say about a movie.
