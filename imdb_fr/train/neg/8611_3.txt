When Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll he is hilarious. In My 5 women, he is not on a roll. The timing of the one-liners is offbeat, but it's the best thing to do for the movie. The five women who play the wives do not form a single actress among them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is weak enough; There are some jokes about having several women, but the situation has nothing to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could play the same way, even though Rodney's character had only one woman. The principle thus seems more the fantasy of an old man than the key element of the comedy. Another fantasy of an old man: we are supposed to accept that the character of Rodney is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to call his role just to serve a friend, and the rest of the name the actors must simply be desperate for the job. <br /> <br /> The strange headlines at the political correctness later in the film really do not do anything for the film. For those who love their politically correct movies, non-PC humor is always present, and the excuses that flow from it still do not work. For those who hate to see a film give way to political correctness, PC complements are just boring digressions. <br /> <br /> This is the most moderate movie I have ever seen. There are sharp jokes, and bedroom scenes would have made TV shocking 40 years ago, but that's about it. Maybe it was the topless men (jokes). <br /> <br /> The DVD features interviews in which cast members seem to find depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They seem serious, but I kept thinking, "They have to laugh!" There is also a particular disclaimer that suggests that since the film never names Mormons or the Latter-day Saint Church, it is not a kind of them. It does not matter if the film presents a polygamous religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping Rodney would roll, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was pretty good for a guy who was 80 years old at the time.
