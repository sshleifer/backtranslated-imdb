* Sigh * Let us take a stupid, Finnish idea and try to market it as cool. Lordi is at best a mediocre group, and a single gimmick will only take you so far. <br /> <br /> To all of you, marketing idiots, here is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered in Finland trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is OVER. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Of course, they won Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait, they won Eurovision. That's all. I rest my case.
