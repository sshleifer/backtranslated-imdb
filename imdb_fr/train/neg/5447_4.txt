Only the most ardent fan of DORIS DAY could find this one even more bearable to watch. When one thinks of the wealth of material available to tell the story of New York City's most famous blackout, a film that could have covered many true stories of what people had to deal with, that scratches the bottom of the barrel for lack of narrative originality. <br /> <br /> Once again, Doris is outraged because she suspects she has been compromised the night of the power outage when she returned to her Connecticut home, took a sleep potion and Woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same thing, wandering the house by mistake. <br /> <br /> No one can save this mess - neither Doris, nor ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As directed by Hy Averback, this is the weakest vehicle Day has chosen to do because of her husband's machinations and the impossibility of getting out of it. Pity.
