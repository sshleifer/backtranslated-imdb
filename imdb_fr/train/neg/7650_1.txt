I know I'm a minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has about the same talent as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog. It is reminiscent of a hundred other unsuccessful hacks who produce useless treats. <br /> <br /> This film? Is this a shit party? Slater's talent is rarely used, which suggests that he has something else in mind (like his failed relationship). Reid plays as if she had forgotten her drama lessons, had been seriously injured in the head and MADE to forget her drama lessons, or had one of the worst directors in the film's history. I vote on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done the least of which I have taken the least pleasure. Frankly, I'm sure he did this stink. Bloodrayne was competing with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I'm convinced that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean nothing, to worry about. <br /> <br /> This gives a 1.0 / 10 rating to this convoluted and complicated shit party, ... the demon :.
