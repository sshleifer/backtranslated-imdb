It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and all the movies starring Kevin Costner.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked like very uncomfortable throughout this film, as well as its secondary actors did not even seem that they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful comedian, but he just can not transfer his talent to this film, which probably has only two laughs in the painting. If you have not seen film before, avoid it like the plague. Go do something more constructive and interesting, like watching the weather channel or watching the paint dry on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give him a 2/10! <br /> <br />
