This is a big step forward after the surprisingly nice original. This sequel is not as fun as the first part and spends too much time developing intrigues. Tim Thomerson is always the best in this series, but his way of playing is toned down in this entry. The performances are all sufficient, but this time the script lets us down. The action is only routine and the plot is only moderately interesting. So I need a lot of ridiculous laughs to stay entertained during the movie "Trancers". Unfortunately, laughter is rare and this film is at best viewable.
