one of the best celebrity reality shows ever seen. we can see the concerts we can see the life of Britney, I love the five episodes. I have always been surprised by Britney and the subjects in the series. I think some people do not look at it at all. We can say how great she is. she is really funny, very sweet and she loves her fans and we can see how much she loves her work. I do not just give a 10 because k-fed is a real idiot, he does not seem to like Britney at all. They're doing a second season of this great show because it shows some people how much Britney really is. Go Britney your best and you will never leave our hearts.
