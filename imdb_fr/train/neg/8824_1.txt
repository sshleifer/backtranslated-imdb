What can possibly say about this movie other than "spectator beware". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label, as cigarettes do, because it hurts my eyes and ears. I'm rarely so dissatisfied with a horror movie "b", but this movie could not even scare a five-year-old. The aim of a fool crazed with blood in a film is that he should look almost like a god, as if nothing could stop his mad rage, but in this film, the resident psychopath hangs in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and, of course, to follow the popular legend of Santa Claus, this reminds the viewer that this man has no danger, because he is too stupid to be dangerous. Overall, a total waste of film.
