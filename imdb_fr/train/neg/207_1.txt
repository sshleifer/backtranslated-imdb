This film is a 90-minute concert of the Ramones with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is it? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of Ramones, DO NOT REPEAT and I repeat, DO NOT waste your time like I did. It's absolutely unassailable from start to finish. This film should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no plot to find in this movie. As for teen comedy, you scratch the bottom of the barrel with it.
