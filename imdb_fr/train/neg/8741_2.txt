Five minutes after the beginning of the film, you realize that you have already seen everything. It's BOILER. This is the cabinet. And it's THE DEVOCAS ADVOCATE. And there are no new items here. With the exception of Bill Gates' allegory of obliterating everything. Confusions are always good things for making movies, but why does it have to be so extreme? Boiler Room is a good movie because it looks realistic, at least for a while. In Antitrust, everything is wrong. To what extent is it realistic, for example, that your boss pays an impostor to be your girlfriend to force you to work harder and control you? I would give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
