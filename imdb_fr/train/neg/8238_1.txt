This movie was really the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not sit through it all. I also think that the writer must have a weird fetish for women who piss by vomiting and boring ... I mean what it was! I can not believe that this has even been done and I am disgusted to have #ingwasted a Â£ 4 rental fee. The quality of the image and the sound is terrible, the acting does not exist. It was a lame excuse for a movie and the pee, shit and vomit scenes reminded 2 girls of a cup. Urghh ....... AVOID AT ANY COST! The girls seemed to have been picked on the street and had only the role because they would be ready to get rid of their pants ... Even if these girls have a nice body, it certainly does not compensate for the fact that their howls were awful unconvincing and a pain in the ears. <br /> <br /> It was like (maybe worse) than an ammative school production without adequate direction and good, it is not necessary to have a set, because everything seems to turn around of a car ?! <br /> <br /> Certainly not one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I did not find anything positive to say and I would like to think that I could save another person who wastes his money as I did.
