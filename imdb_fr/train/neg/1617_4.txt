What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> No concessions are granted to "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> The facial expressions are usually covered with a thick beard and the Spanish language is a strange monotone texture that sounds the same way in the middle of a battle talk around a campfire . <br /> <br /> I sort of saw these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to be entertained. It is quite long and in some places dull. <br /> <br /> But I guess given the lack of development of the plot, I do not think it's very educational either. <br /> <br /> It is also difficult to perceive any story of the dialogue of the film - it would be a good idea to read a bit about the story in order to understand the context of what is happening happens, because for some reason the director did not see fit to inform the public why Che's band was moving the way they did - so there seems to be groups walking around the woods for no reason and who get shot. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to give this film more stars for generating somehow more empathy with me and developing a depth of character, but in one way or another, all the characters were still unknown to me at the end. The stars he gets are intended for realism and the demonstration of the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
