This show offers interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is portrayed as a reality, but in reality it is a television drama in prime time. He tries to use exotic places like facade to get people to a bogus contest and then hook the viewers on the soap opera of the contestants. <br /> <br /> He also borrows from a pioneer of the game show CBS Beat The Clock by inventing situations for his competitors to try and overcome. Then he rewards the winner. If they can spice up with a little interaction between the characters, it's even better. Although the game format is slow compared to Beat The Clock, the real feat of this series is to escape reality. <br /> <br /> This show features elements of several successful past program types. Reality TV, hardly, but if you're addicted to competitors, the region or the contest, it's your cup of tea. If you do not do it, this whole series is like I say, drivel dripping with sauce. This is another hidden show behind the reality show label which is the trend it started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is smooth and well produced, so it could last a while longer. After all, it's the same for Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. It does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is about the same.
