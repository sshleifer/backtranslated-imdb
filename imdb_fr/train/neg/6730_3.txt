This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a sexual relationship of a night and declares it a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues, I had the impression that only three had really heard of the truth. I was waiting for the movie to go better, and it worked a little, but never better. It's an interesting concept, and I always wanted it to be good, but it never worked. Maybe if they were really love stories, it would have worked.
