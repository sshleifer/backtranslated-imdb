This is perhaps the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Authors and producers should study German films from the 1930s and 1940s. They knew how to sell. Even a clumsy Soviet-style leader with a fatherly figure worthy of God was better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith found in the church at the last second just in time for dad to be "saved" by the Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, it seemed hasty and not melodramatic enough. Some celestial and foggy shots of angelic Hoover in the corner of the screen radiating and nodding would have added a lot. The best part is that Hoover only saves the deserving family and the children who "proved" their value. Unfortunately, other homeless poor have been described as sympathetic and even good, but Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have been to photograph them drinking alcohol to show the justice of their condition. Finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should have turned in the end. We could then see how Hoover-God had saved not only this deserving family, but also all the deserving ones. Amateur at best.
