I just do not see how a Jim Wynorski's Concorde-New Horizons film starring Andrew Stevens' acting talent and a puppet might be bad. It's beyond the spirit, right? <br /> <br /> Well, make no mistake. "Munchie Strikes Back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has existed for centuries. For unexplained reasons until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has to repay her loan on her mortgage in two weeks ... at a not-so-low price of $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not find the money because she has just been fired. OK ... JUST is the key word of this sentence. What ...? Was she planning to pay for it with a single pay check? It might have been a good idea to spend in recent years to save for that ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to those that a genius would have ... but there is no limit on how many wishes you can make! Munchie gives the boy a lot of fancy stuff for one night, but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall. Munchie "borrowed" it. The annoying furball also uses his skills from another world to help the boy win a baseball game by deceiving. A baseball is hit so hard that it turns several times around the Earth. Unfortunately, idiot parents watching the game do not think it's strange. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to finish because it has already exhausted enough of my life force. You'll be really moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, kicks a barking dog. Your heart will melt under her spell when she notices the dollar bills fluttering on her garden and she wonders how it could snow during the summer. The credits for "Munchie Strikes Back" promised another movie to follow titled, I believe, "Munchie Hangs Ten". To this day, the public watching the movies has been deprived of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. He h. 1/10
