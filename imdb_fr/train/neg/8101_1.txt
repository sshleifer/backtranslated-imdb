It is often said that films can never match the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the film not "as good" as the book, but is an insult to the book. I would rather see Milan Kundera's novel inflamed than in this "something", which the director probably calls "adaptation". <br /> <br /> All the beautiful philosophy that arises "is it better to carry a heavy burden on your shoulders, or face the unbearable lightness of being?" is set aside, and instead of this, the whole movie deals with the sexual adventures of Daniel Day Lewis (I can not tell Tomas) with his mute wife, his mistress and his other mistresses. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said: bad directors make bad movies. Do not waste your time and money. Read the book, it's really worth it.
