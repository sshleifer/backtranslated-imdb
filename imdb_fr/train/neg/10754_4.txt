While waiting to enter the theater with tickets in hand, I was expecting an interesting fantasy sci-fi film that could finally feed my appetite for movies about robot technology; the effects can not help a boring conspiracy, which in my opinion was the worst of this year. In this film, I am also unhappy, Will Smith has not shown anything new in this film, but I have never seen his role change since "Men In Black", which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retire since, without spoiling his name with titles like "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
