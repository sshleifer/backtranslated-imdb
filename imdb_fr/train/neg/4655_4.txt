I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The first moments, with a naked woman slumped and a painter, Diana, about to paint her and then suck her blood to let it flow so that she can use it for her art, give the impression that it could be a dazzling art-vampire movie. It turns out that this initial impression is false. Oh, Troma, the mark of a certain lack of quality: sometimes they will offer something sordid but fun and with at least some skill in junk food (or sometimes not). This is a case where it is not even very amusing to watch since his attempts at humor (that is to say that the father of the protagonist is an old vaudevillian who makes impressions of Jimmy Durante?) Better low, and all unintentional laughter is mitigated by Sergio Lapel negotiating the direction of the basement. <br /> <br /> And it is not without him that he tries, oh Lord no. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, of course, but the way they were used in the film made me, a former filmmaker student and budding director, sulky in my place: if I saw that in a theater, I should blind your eyes in many cases, and wonder if his DP really understood the basic configuration of 3-point lighting. While this, with a very dull sound design (or just a lot of random buzzing, like in the art galleries scene), should not be something that catches the eye when Troma goes out, he should to be something "basic" that a filmmaker can tackle even if the scenario is not very funny or scary (and this is not the case) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed at times weird. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, far from it. and maybe if you're a vampire vampire (or just a vampiric one), it might have some appeal as an economical alternative to low rent for Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over Blood Freak's 1972. You have overall better ways to waste your time.
