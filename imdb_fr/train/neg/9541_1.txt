I guess a lot of people comment on their first film on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible - I write because of it. <br /> <br /> I was excited by the sequel to "Wargames" .. I thought the original was pretty good given its time and content. I felt it was worth watching more than once. Since 2008, I had a lot of hope for what they would do with this movie. The computers, the games, the terror and the excessive zeal of the military have increased so much since the beginning of the first film, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had the opportunity to turn it into a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film has failed at almost all levels, but I blame the writers and all those who have ideas on the realism of the game aspects particularly. "The Dead Code" was a simulator of the 1990s with some people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer is grinding around 7,000 button commands - none of which affect what's happening on the screen. Until the moment he "wins" by clicking with his mouse on a box of the screen that releases a gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is near the gas). Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Even if any child between the ages of 5 and 16 can do the same job - The government believes it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ... He displayed less knowledge than someone reading the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on Bio-Terror. It follows a scene of pursuit throughout the film with about 0.01% of the budget and the enthusiasm aroused by one of Bourne's titles. They have about 1,000 opportunities to catch up and deal with it. Sometimes they are crazy, they barely miss him, but at other times they masterfully create opportunities, simply letting him go intentionally to follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would write more .. but I had already lost an hour and a half watching that, I'd rather watch Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for an hour and a half .
