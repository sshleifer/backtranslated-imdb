I chose this film to replace the lamentable choice of daytime television and to accompany my thirst for a femme fatale. Well, for the previous one, it's better than daytime TV .... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its points, but after about 20-30 minutes, the good points emerge and it comes to the conclusion that they watch a TV movie made for television that was mounted with little of time to do something that will hold together. In short, a movie-like Sci Fi chain terrible. <br /> <br /> He has his points such as the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course, it's not "Blade Runner". The captain looks, feels a lot like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person he might be good at. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, he ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda" crew consists of poor copies of the intelligent gunners of "Aliens", the mystic is the Willow intensified sexually vampire, and the new captain could just as easily resemble Jan-Michael Vincent running on "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits"; he wore only the uniform with the epaulets; there is very little right. All run with their version of force inside a ship that looks a lot like "Eureka Maru" because they fight a class of "people" who occupy the universe and are divided into several tribes or sects of different evolving qualities ....... just like the Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> This could have a redemptive function with Michael Ironside, but after a while, it feels like he's played the role like a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it does not help much. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "ok". All right, we can watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch ads, they will probably change channels. We could watch it once .......... but a few hours later, wondering what drove them to watch everything. <br /> <br /> For me, it was the femme fatale. ............ when she was fighting.
