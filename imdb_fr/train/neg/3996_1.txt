I do not see what everyone liked in this movie. The staging was too long and talkative and once that was done, the main character was as flat and opaque as in the first scene. Once the film finally allowed Cusack to be in the eponymous hotel room, I had to ask myself, well, what's going to happen here for about an hour to keep me engaged? The answer: not much, just John Cusack having a long mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Cusack's character had more depth. . maybe if his panic was a more complete reworking of his daily life. . . perhaps if the film had either better developed its half-cooked themes of loss and faith, or had not addressed them in the first place. . . perhaps if the film had chosen to be either a psychological horror or a horror of thrills, it had fully adopted one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror fans and none of us really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the disturbing episode on the hotel's cornice, the alarming mad with the hammer and the guardian of the crypt so stupid that it was fun in the conduit of air, which do not take more than five minutes of movie, this movie was boring. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas to himself?
