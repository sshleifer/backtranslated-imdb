My wife and I had high hopes for this film, but it was a big disappointment. It was an Amerindian version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails everything he tries, for example. fishing, hunting, obviously, he submits his family to his wildest fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but he often lies to his son about various obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. The children and the woman are real, which makes the film even sadder. I do not understand humor ... unless you like to laugh at others who ridicule themselves. I do not understand how this could have resulted in rewards. Save your money, it's not worth the rental.
