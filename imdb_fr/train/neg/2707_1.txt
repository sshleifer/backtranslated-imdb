It's one of the most putrid movies of the '90s. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This image portrays African Americans as wild, uneducated, violent, inarticulate, smoking sociopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his group of mates are continually disrespectful to others in the dormitory, not only whites, but also Asians, and are never sanctioned for their actions. In spite of all this tolerance, they continue to moan and cry about the evil white oppressors who lead their lives and stand before their path. In fact, it's Fudge's influence that causes Remmy to bond with the skinheads, drop out of school and possibly kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The skinheads are presented as a secret group eliminate the campus and stay away from everyone else. They never blow up their music to annoy people and do not taunt the police. They commit serious crimes such as battery and rape, but they are not as repulsive or as threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that have almost offended me or made me laugh. Some of them are: <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are declared students at Columbus University, but we never see them in class and we do not know how they pay their tuition fees schooling. It only remains to speculate that the weeds they smoke have something to do with their finances. Although they are students in what looks like a private university, they can not pronounce a single line of correct English. Their characters are developed only by their compulsive moans and their xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems Kristen drunk (Kristy Swanson) knew very well why Billy, drunk, was taking him home. She even asked him to get a rubber to start. The fact that he enters without a condom has become a rape, while it would be great if he had one at hand. Later, Taryn (Jennifer Connely) assured Kristen that she had no responsibility in the matter. Despite the fact that she jumped voluntarily into a guy's bed, she was not ready for sex and was viciously exploited by a sexual predator. Then, about a week later, she met and slept with an ultra-sensitive beneficent who knew how to avoid rape and bring her a condom. The director insisted on contraception thoroughly. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and disgusting, it gives the impression that blacks look like bites and that women look stupid and fragile. Cole Hauser's role as actor and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I can think of watching it. The screenwriter / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit yours by observing this crap if you want, but keep in mind that neurons do not grow back. Just follow the tips at the end and UNLEARN.
