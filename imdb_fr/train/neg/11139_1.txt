There is not much to say about this film, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> The actors' game and the dialogue are far from being decent, the story of the hybrid werewolf is not very well explained and the whole thing has holes of intrigue here and there . <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not want to see. It's so amateur that it makes me throw up. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the extras. The gag. All the rest, just a waste of time and money. I hope nobody will buy it, it is not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Stay away.
