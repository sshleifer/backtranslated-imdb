Terminus Paradise was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" comes too late. We already have enough and we want something new. <br /> <br /> The great directors should have no problem to see beyond their time, not behind. Why do people see Romania only as a post-revolutionary land? <br /> <br /> We are not born, we are not reincarnated and no one cares anymore about the past. Most people do not remember or want to remember, and the new generation of film consumers does not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian film, not the final song - priveghi! Maybe the youngest directors should make the move.
