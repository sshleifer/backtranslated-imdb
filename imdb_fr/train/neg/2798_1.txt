This film is bad. If you plan to watch it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think the high school plays probably have a better acting game. The plot is meaningless. The whole thing was pretty bad and it was not even good to make fun of him. It was just dull and very very bad! I looked at it on Starz so I thought it must be at least decent. The mini description sounded like everything was going to be fine. The girlfriend kills herself for no apparent reason at the beginning of the movie, after watching a horrible video. The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and it's like someone is putting a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to turn them. Just cut from one scene to another, no finesse. A bit as if I changed randomly to talk about the seriousness of the film to explain why the plot was nil. The audio becomes weak at times, where you can barely hear it, and then get loud with "horror screams" gays thrown at random places in the movie. It's the same sound every time. It's officially the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actor: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Screenplay: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Meter-meter: 1,000,000/10
