The Class is a humorous series featuring a group of former classmates aged 27. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny, even if its potential is obvious. It's not corky enough, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slow tempo and the lack of hilarious hitting lines. Some actors also have difficulties with timing. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters invented are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but they seem a bit too square for the sake of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find the most uninteresting are Ethan, the main character, and Duncan-Nicole, a couple who has already been a man. <br /> <br /> What bothers me in the series is that the only Latin American character Aaron is being taken for his accent (though by a non-respectable character, but still).
