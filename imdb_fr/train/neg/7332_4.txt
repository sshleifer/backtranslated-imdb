Although this is a 2001 film, the direction of the film is a kind of artistic style of the 90s, considered "old" and outdated a few years ago. The cuts and effects of cheese were painful to watch. The scenario is quite correct and some scenes captivated me (as when the taxi driver takes him at night on the bridge). But the story with the detective who is the sister committed suicide and how he was obsessed with suicide was just terrible. The performance of the actor playing Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. However, I have been to the whole movie, which is rare for the kind of random movie that we find on television and that we decide to watch.
