I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and I accompanied my friends to watch a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we had not seen was Inspector Gadget, we decided to embark on this adventure. <br /> <br /> A big mistake. It is a film that could please only children. Oh, and it's not like I do not like movies for young audiences. But this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to bed. Better than wasting hard-earned money on it. Go see the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
