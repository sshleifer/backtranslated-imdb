After reading the reviews, it became clear that everyone had intellectualized this work. It's completely boring. Oh how about the good old days and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments, no one expressed any emotion about this work or any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up right after the end of the Steam Age and this film gem with Dan'l Boone honored the mornings on Saturday afternoon. It was an annual film that went around and filled the seats with bumbling monsters, yapping, farting, giggling, snots like me or myself. And it was a movie filler at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that each review contains information about the plot. The problem is that it was rather a model. Here you are. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) meets friends and will defeat these villains. Hurray! <br /> <br /> We all understood the plot before diving into our neighborhood to watch it. It was pretty much the plot of all Scott movies, John Wayne and Roy Rogers ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each film, do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> We must not forget the context of the time. There was no or little television. None for children. There was the school. There was the big spaces. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies like this one have entertained and fed the imagination of young whippersnappers. Even the girls came in. <br /> <br /> This film was animation. And he's as stupid as anything that's produced today. It was originally a propaganda goal. But quickly, they are children's movies. <br /> <br /> Our fathers experienced the reality. And it was not until ten years later, Sam Peckinpah, who finally lavished red splashes of blood imitation in realistic and abundant quantities. It was only until his appointment to the leadership that someone died slowly, with pain and misery. Until the Peckinpah war and armed fighting is a rather bloodless affair. Thank you Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie, there was little or no blood, it did not bother adults. They would not have tolerated it, I think. No guts spray the life of the plant that breaks. So this movie had all the glory and none of the bloody ones. Gung Ho was then suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I have assigned a 4 to this note. Why should I do it? Well. It's a terrible movie. It does not matter how I like it. I love this movie because it brought back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But it's not so good of a movie in terms of quality. Basically, Gung Ho has become a love novel for children. <br /> <br /> If people watch it. Of course. I do not say to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. The shallow characters? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
