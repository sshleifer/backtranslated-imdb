Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the film producers think they are? ABSOLUTE WORST movie, the most UNREALISTIC I've seen for as long as I can remember. This film is so bad that I felt compelled to register on IMDb and to ensure that the ranking of this "film" decreases. <br /> <br /> omg i'm heather graham, i just kissed a drunk chick, so while she fainted, i'll REALLY pound in my room for hours frantically asking me " WHAT HAD I DID ?! " feeling silly producers ... and while I'm there, instead of this being a pathetic excuse for a short story, it might have been more appropriate to center the plot on a mentally unstable character. ..as your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know that the first time I had a gay sex, when I left the next morning, I jumped to heaven with excitement at middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, hold on ... <br /> <br /> WHAT RAIN! and note that there are many other faults and frightfully stupid aspects in this lame film, but I'm so fed up with thinking about it even more. At the end of the day, if you're a smart person, you'll hate this movie, and if you're not an intelligent person, you'll love it ... it's as simple as that.
