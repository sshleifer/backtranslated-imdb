What begins with a pretty clever joke about a shady security surveillance company almost instantaneously turns to the mystery of an uninteresting and completely meaningless murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying hard to make this train wreck observable, but some things are just not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What, for example, makes Gale suddenly turn into a sweet, mother-of-the-art, mother-shrew mother in Tommy's parents? Why does Heinrich, although he is declared a sleezebag, want to destroy the company to which he devotes his life, stealing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does Tommy, apparently reasonable, believe that Heinrich could be a murderer (almost entirely based on a dream), and even if it was credible, why would not he go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when she came home, especially after scolding Howie about her absence? Of course, all these events are necessary for the unfolding of the plot (and I use the term very vaguely). And that might be forgivable if it resulted in any comedy. But everything from Howie's description of Howie's rape to the coroner's misidentification of Gale to the latest "joke" about Gale and Howie still dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else. . <br /> <br /> I ticked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing more than myself or anyone else to do to spoil this thing that stinks already in heaven.
