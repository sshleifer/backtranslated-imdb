In this British horror movie, all the logic is at the rendezvous. This British horror film takes place in the London Underground and stars Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), which is generally reliable. goes to sleep in a subway station, then wakes up and discovers that she is imprisoned and ends up being pursued by "someone" or "something" with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and the incredible are commonplace and there are very few moments that are really nervous / scary, but many others are simply dull. <br /> <br /> In short, an unpleasant film that should remain locked forever and serve us. <br /> <br /> The only good thing here is the inclusion in the cast of the famous veteran actor Ken Campbell, who did better than that? it's even including "Erasmus Microman"!
