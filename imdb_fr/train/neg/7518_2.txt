Horror movies can be very entertaining with a small budget, bad action and a bit of panache. I think the film simply lacks panache, because, scene after scene deafening, people seize hold in the hands of a ridiculously harmless hand forceps. If it was not so boring, it could be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can go a long way with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house", just like the Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a plot similar standard. Hallow's End, unfortunately, does not go very far. In fact, it's not going anywhere. He spends much of his time creating anonymous and faceless characters with what appears to be an endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against the development of the characters, not even in a horror movie, but they are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha-male, the milquetoast, the ... uh ... disposable characters that exist especially for sex scenes.) More than forty minutes without bloodshed and buzzing with them were more horrible than when the bloodshed started. <br /> <br /> Well, implied bloodshed anyway. When college kids laugh at their haunted house (a vampire, burglar-proof vest, and white crepe), they look a lot like their haunted indoor costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, is a comparative masterpiece. There is not really a gore to talk about, nor is there really any fear. <br /> <br /> I thought of this one in almost every way. If it was supposed to be a tight and suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things were moving so slowly), pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was supposed to be a real horror movie about blood and guts (which would explain the schlock) ... where is the blood and guts? And the anticlimax is one of the shameless endings of a movie I've ever seen. This is the kind of film that, although there is no narrator in the film, is suspended by voice-overs because any dialogue without meaning was simply not enough. <br /> <br /> It was difficult. ... coming out, I wonder if I just attended a Christian horror movie. Maybe "I know hell exists" of the opening was not designed this way, but there are clues (or misguided indications - I do not know which one). Despite all the blasphemies of the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" is a bit absurd, as are most crucifixes worshiping, God fearing and satan-dreadful, especially after luxurious sex scenes T & A (a heterosexual) . , a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian society (the Highland Myst logo even looks like a crucifix), then this movie weighs heavily for the atheist camp. An all-powerful being can not be so bad a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
