Well, in the endless quest for horror, we will meet this movie, which seems to have been reissued on DVD recently for an impious reason. The transfer is horrible and the quality is zero. I do not think this is due to a bad editing or anything, I just think the film is badly done. "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not take the walk until about an hour. First of all, we see a "nerd" because he is chosen by a group of ... I do not do it. I do not even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks? The leader, with his ultra-gripper, is so ugly that he should have been called a nerd. Then there is a "big guy" and a couple of stupid losers and chicks who are supposed to be "hot" but are not. It's a mystery why this group of rejects chooses one of theirs, but I suppose the viewer must assume that they are "cool kids" who choose a dweeb. The casting choices are appalling because most high school students are played by thirties. As other critics have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that) are a bunch of Britons whose accents glide repeatedly throughout this piece of shit. It remains for us to suppose that this group of "children" was the only pupil of this school, because their "meeting" concerns only these at the school, which is now abandoned, it is only them. <br /> <br /> The victims are lame, the blood is not terrible and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me goosebumps ..." and "Someone gives me a beer" are highlights ... It's just not good. Ignore this one unless you are lost with friends and want to laugh at a lame slasher attempt. If you want to see good things, get yourself the "Bay Of Blood" of Bava, made 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good BAD, see "Just before dawn" or "The burning". 2 children out of 10, children.
