As a poker lover, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially since he had Scotty Nyugen in it. <br /> <br /> Basically, the small tasks of Scotty Nyugens in this film are all you need to do it. <Br /> <br /> The characters are incomparable and embarrassing, the soundtrack is awful and intriguing, well, there is none. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I had a headache and I found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD Box after twenty minutes, I was THIS boredom. It's a shame that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not have wasted $ 16 to buy it on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it to me - AVOID like 7 2 out of breath !!! Terrible. :(
