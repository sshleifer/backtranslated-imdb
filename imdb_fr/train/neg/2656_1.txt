(Very light spoilers maybe.) <br /> <br /> Normally Diane Keaton's fan, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour because I did not feel absolutely sympathetic with my daughter or my mother. Both were egocentric with little regard for others, and their daughter also added grossly, disrespectfully and imprudently to the mix. When the girl died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we will not have to look at her anymore." Keaton did a good job passing in her state of stupefaction and mourning, but she was already too far for me. I just did not like it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you have to worry about the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The support The cast was sincere and well played - I felt for * them! * - and the best gay friend was wonderful, but even combined, that was not enough to make the film for me.
