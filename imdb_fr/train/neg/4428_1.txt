You lose 100 IQ points just to give you. This show must be awful, I refuse to tune in what I saw in advertisements. Where did they unearth this guy anyway? Also, what do they plan to do next season? The secret is unveiled. Everyone already knows the setting up? Will they look for people who have lived under a rock to play in the next season? Where are they going to dig up more stupid women? No wonder America is a big joke for strangers, look what you are looking at!
