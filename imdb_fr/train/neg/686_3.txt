In what would be his first scenario, based on his own new "Turn About", William Faulkner delivers a strange story of loyalty, sacrifice and truly strange relationships. Originally, the story concerned only the characters of Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another image to fulfill his contract, and Faulkner forced by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that his lines be written in the same shortened style as Young and Tone of his co-stars, leading to an involuntary hilarity when these three people communicate in a shortcut similar to a telegraph that looks like a Monty Python sketch ( "Wuthering Heights" executed in semaphore). Seriously, almost entirely non-pronoun sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also covers familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost abnormally close relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young offers to Crawford, in the presence of Tone, ALL THREE exchange their engraved childhood rings engraved between them. The proximity of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially when they go to their Thelma & Louise destiny. Frankly, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Not as scary for this New Yorker, though, as the recurring theme of the gigantic cockroach, Wellington, that Crawford catches merrily (and that is frantically presented in his hands - I had to turn away !) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech. <br /> <br /> That said, there are good performances. Young is particularly engaged in a scene where he was embarked on Cooper's fighter, and Roscoe Karns is a charming flying companion to Cooper. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through a realistic dialogue, has a good time throwing his own furtive tears on the fate of his friend Young. Crawford, devoid of any constructive dialogue, usually appears as wood or melodramatic, which is an act of balance for a role. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes - unsurprisingly, for a Howard Hawks movie - are the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As far as I'm concerned, it's been 75 minutes of my life that I'll never come back.
