I was so hoping to see the adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed by a film that did not catch my attention from the beginning, even though I tried to watch it twice! <br /> <br /> It was an added advantage that Caradine was in this film, but it had nothing to do with the lack of sympathy of the actors. For something similar, Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans, but if you are looking for There is something to say that seduces in terms of martial arts and intrigue. If you just want the kids to settle on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe that suits you with the 3 ninjas.
