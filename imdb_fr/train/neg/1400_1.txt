Oh, my god ... I thought that CBS TV shows in prime time were the worst things in which Gerald McRaney appeared ... <br /> <br /> > Four people are experienced by a crazy control of the computer <br /> <br /> spirit. That's it, do not rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw it under one of its many titles - "Gray Matter", and maybe it's <br /> <br /> one of the worst memory movies recent. The other <br /> <br /> reviews are accurate, it's awful. Never have so many current plans ever appeared on the screen, EVER. The cast is awful, the direction <br /> <br /> is awful and the scenario is awful. I can not emphasize how awful it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as you would smallpox. <br /> <br /> It is classified (PG) for physical violence, some armed violence, <br /> soft, a little secular and some adult situations
