The underground comedy film, is probably the worst train wrecks I have ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this film, and my friend reluctantly agreed to look at it, saying it was so horrible, but he had to prove to me how horrible it was. I love the comedy of colors. I thought at least that he would have some and that I would be entertained. No, instead, the acting was so horrible, the "jokes" were extremely lame, and the plot was not found. Maybe it was not supposed to be intrigue, so I can not blame this movie. It's pretty sad when the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman who gets beaten by Batman ... Batman ... A man wearing a baseball uniform wielding a bat. Hilarious. Simply genius. I had the impression while watching this film that its creators had made it and laughed hysterically with their friends. Maybe it was full of jokes that we just did not understand. Or maybe they are the worst garbage ever made and they should be locked in a vault and dumped into the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
