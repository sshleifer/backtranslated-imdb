They should have called this film: "Adopted Mouse Brother, slightly inspired by the vague memory of Stuart Little, who crushes the book a bit, but remembers the cover" If it was not so deceiving, I would give it a better criticism. <br /> <br /> But seriously, please your children and have them read the book. Maybe they could learn something instead of being numb by what we all call a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart Little is not a mouse, it's a person who happens to be very small and like a mouse. He was born of his parents, not adopted. The book talks about his life and his possible departure from home and the journey he undertakes. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks to eat and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not speak. <br /> <br /> In the movie, they are wrong. I think the only things they hid from the book were the boat race and the names.
