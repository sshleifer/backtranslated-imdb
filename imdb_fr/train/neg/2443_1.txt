It's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies of all time. it's so bad that I found it quite nice. the acting, oh my god, the scenario, you have to be crazy. how do you imagine the writer tackling such topics as: - a child who makes fireworks at school, fireworks so MUCH powerful, that when someone is hit, he flies at a hundred meters back and explodes. -A girl is stuck in the celler, the killer tries to open the door. she gets an exercise, but the thread is not long enough. she first makes an extension, oh horror, and then, when she's finished, she breaks through the door and crosses the killer's head. WOW - and there are plenty of other examples like this one. oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was awesome (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool Luke hand)
