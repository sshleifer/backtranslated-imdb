At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the popcorn as loud as possible to drown the lower dialogue. This is absolutely not a girls movie. All the types who like her are those who, we women, can be sure of staying away from it. A silly story, a mediocre dialogue and a cheap movie. I have seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner in the wrong category. If you see it, the thing you are looking forward to is the end. So you can finally get out of the theater as fast as possible.
