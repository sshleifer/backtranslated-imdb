I'll keep it fast and nice. On the way back from a football match, five girls decide to take a "shortcut" that leads them on a deserted road traversed by the forest. Of course, only good things happen to them and they arrive safely. <br /> <br /> Okay, they do not do it. Soon, they are hunted by a disturbed chick struggling with serious mental problems. It follows 90 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope I never see any of these actors in a movie. Their screaming screaming voices gave me a headache and the script was so badly written that it included many repetitive phrases and crazy hysterical howls. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
