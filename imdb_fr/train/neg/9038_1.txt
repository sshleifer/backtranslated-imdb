This is a terrible production of Bartleby, although not, as the other critic has said, because it is "infilmable", but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. He tells the story, almost painfully. Looking at it, I could turn the pages of my book and follow, which is not so much fun when it comes to an adaptation. See rather the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. This version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the minutia of things such as the scenery, the names of the characters and the costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if an adaptation is poorly managed, painful and numb.
