This film was a rather strange experience. The film is obviously based on a play. Now, I'm sure everything in this movie works very well in a play, but that in a movie, it does not really look interesting enough to watch. The film is much too "scenic" and they did not even bother to change part of the dialogue to make it more suitable for a film. Instead, what is being presented now is an almost literal re-filming of a play, with superb characters and a staged dialogue. Because of all this, the scenario really does not work and the movie becomes an almost complete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while to understand that this is a comedy watching. At first, you think it's a drama you're watching, with weird characters, but as the movie progresses, you'll notice that the movie is more of a tragicomedy, which really looks more into the genre of the comedy only about the genre of fiction. The characters and dialogues are really the elements that make this film an eccentric and extravagant film that sometimes becomes truly unassailable. Of course, the actors are great. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but they do not really raise the film to a "sufficiently observable" level. <br /> <br /> The story seems totally disoriented. Basically, the story is about nothing and focuses primarily on the sibling characters portrayed by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what are we talking about exactly? The film seems to be a useless and obsolete film that has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as a film, it's not appropriate and just does not work. <br /> <br /> The editing is just horrible. even laughable in some sequences. <br /> <br /> One could expect more from the director J. Lee Thompson, who has obviously made much better films than this rather failed piece, staged translated on screen, project. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
