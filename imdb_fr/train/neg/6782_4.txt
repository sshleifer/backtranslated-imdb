This is not one of Keaton's best efforts, it may be a veiled attempt to take revenge on the family he married - the Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster to marry a great Irish woman, who (with her father and brothers) treats him chaos until they think he could be a heir to a fortune. Erroneous identities abound here - gags are erected and, for the most part, they yield nothing. <br /> <br /> This short metro has at least two bursts of laughter - Buster cleverly remedies his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the fundamental ignorance of his adoptive family to bring literally the meat on his plate. The other is a family picture, the whole group collapsing slowly on the floor when the camera tripod loses stability. <br /> <br /> The overflow of yeast beer could have catalyzed a series of large-scale gags built on gags, but stop short (for all the buildup) of development. <br /> <br /> The impression of Kino is crisp and clear and the score is that of playing piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth the laugh.
