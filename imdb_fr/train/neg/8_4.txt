6/10 Actor, not great, but good actor. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The director makes stupid decisions for this film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story does not make sense at all and has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall rating for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this film and maybe it's too much. The characters are so exaggerated that they can never do it in real life and some inexplicable stuff happens "in a narrative way", not in the right way. Due to the style of this film, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements, camera shake and fast advances). It's always good that the movie uses music so that the story runs smoothly, but this one contains too many tracks. In the first hour, there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
