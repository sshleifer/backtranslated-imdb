Another scam on Friday the 13th, with even some of his music! A group of young adults gather for a small high school meeting and start being slaughtered at Jason Voorhees. Could he be that nerd they tormented at school? <br /> <br /> The slash-fest routine is fun for fans of the genre and contains the usual T & A quota for movies if you're fed up. The end is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: rated for violence / violence, language, sexuality, nudity and a share of drugs.
