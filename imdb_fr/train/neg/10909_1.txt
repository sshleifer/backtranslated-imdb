It's a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and the scenario is nil! There may be a funny joke, it's stupid and boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it was going to end. <br /> <br /> Nobody acts humanly, and everyone is stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider behaving like an animal is not something I would pay to see. It sounded funny, but the end result: DO NOT SPEND PRECIOUS TIME ON THIS RIDICLE AND STUPID FILM. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it was going to end, even if it's short film. At first we thought it would be better; but it's getting worse. Stupid, to the end. I left theater and I would remember that this movie was extremely bad forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this movie is a screenwriter of Simpsons TV, but it's not like The Simpsons movie is void !!!)
