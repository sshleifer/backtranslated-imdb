This film was almost intolerable to get through. I can go beyond the fact that it seems to have been shot with a domestic camera and this film is supposed to be spread out over several weeks, but the characters do not change their outfit, but the acting has broken the fourth wall in pieces for me. . I saw better playing in a 4th grade room. Apart from that, the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the guy with whom he would have denounced him. I was also very disappointed that all the murders were committed with a gun, what kind of gore is that. It is not an imitator that the Zodiac did not kill using only a firearm, the authorities would have known that it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, which is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders and not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a reduced budget, at least not as low as this one, or they could have made sure to have better actors or more gore . Many people have chosen the low-budget route without having to use horrible actors like Easy Rider with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a small budget.
