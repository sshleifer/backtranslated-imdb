Well, I was excited at first to download an open source animation movie, which was ruined by a demo. The animation is excellent, the lip sync is awful and you continue to watch the movie in the hope of understanding what is happening, but to realize that nothing is happening. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators who waste their time. I have seen shorts with twice as much emotion in half the time! This could be an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone at Blender is thrilled to introduce their software and rendering capabilities, but what's so bad is telling a story, that's what makes a movie.
