Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels totally empty and decides to go out and get drunk. When he returns home, he comes up against a girl who places ads. Although she does not know, he falls in love and begins to follow her, obsessively. The beginning of the movie is a little slow and can be boring for most people. However, when the action begins, it's a little better (not much!) Perhaps, the best part is the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes) that you can see in the middle of the film; is not good for eroticism, but for the funny and the unexpected, it's the stage, it's probably the best of the movie, neither the actors nor the staging are good, and the result is a movie boring that may sound funny to some people (not to me) .All the movie is based on absurd situations (silly, as the movie says), which have something interesting.I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe the worst!).), he knows better how to do it.
