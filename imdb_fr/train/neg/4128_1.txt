This movie is one of the most horrible I have ever seen. Not only is the dialogue horrible, but it never ends. You will think that it ends, but it is not. How long is 140 minutes, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never look at him again. It's as if someone is taking a romantic comedy, going out the comedy, then deciding to downplay the importance of romance, leaving us with the pile of shit that has managed to make its way to the screen. But do not take my word for it, find out for yourself how terrible this movie is.
