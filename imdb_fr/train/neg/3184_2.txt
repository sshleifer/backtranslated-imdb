JD was never impressed by JD anyway, and Final Justice (which I had never seen before on MST3k) is no exception. This character is not less friendly than Mitchell: it's just that Geronimo ("Call me 'Heronimo") is less friendly. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is suspected that Mitchell and Final Justice were all Schemes of an agent seeking revenge from Joe Don trying to kill "the star" by causing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must have found a new agent, since he's now graduated in "comic relief" The problem is that it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters out there and his "serious" characters in his action movies like this one. <br /> <br /> As for the plot .. They repeat the same scenes so that you thought repeatedly look at the second day of Groundhog. We can assume that the fact that they continue to use the same scene where Geronimo gets out of prison is supposed to be comical relief Hmmm, yes, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the landscape of Malta is beautiful, which earned me a 2 for me. licking Maltese tourism back a few decades, though.
