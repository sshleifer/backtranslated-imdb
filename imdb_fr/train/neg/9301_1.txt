If you want to call them that ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this movie so that people can really see a 1/10. Where to start, let's start from the top ... <br /> <br /> HISTORY: Do not believe the principle: the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people finally understand what happens in these mysterious events. are. It's a basic game, basic, go to the cabin cinema without intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> THE SCREEN SCREEN: I usually give credits to freelance writers, it's hard work when you start ... but this is shit. The story is flat - it leaves you emotionless throughout the movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable: "Woah, you totally panicked me" and "I was wondering if you would ... if you want ... um, do you want to come to the booth with me?" It makes me want to tear all my hair, one strand at a time, and feed it to myself. <br /> <br /> CHARACTERS: THE HEALTHY WORLD !!!! Some have described the characters as being flat, I want to go a step further and say that they actually have an inverted character arcade. They are actually starting to work on a parallel universe and are almost starting to act in the background ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: Worse that the characters are the actors. They are already taking bad characters and adding terrible drama to high school. The "Woah you panicked me completely" was said so monotonous and slow - as if it was dumb. I could complain for hours about the only actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight year old child would be disappointed by the lighting of this film. Too dark in areas, too bleached in others. The director should not use light as emotion until he has learned to properly illuminate an elementary scene. No baby! SOUND: How much sound does it take to make a film that's really gruff? 9. With so many sounds, it should seem incredible, but on the contrary. There is one scene in particular that is obvious, these guys drive in a car and the sound of the car changes at each corner of the camera ... LOW! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm running out of space to complain ... praise him - I challenge you ... praise him and learn him ... give him the 1 note..it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Disconnect ...
