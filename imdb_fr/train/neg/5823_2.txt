"Drawing Restraint 9" is a kind of movie we love or hate; luckily or not, I left with a strong impression of waste of time and prank of "killing the whales, it's bad" propaganda Aesthetically, the film could have pleased, especially its first half, until it is not clear that each action described is an allegory of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it might be fun to look at the daily tasks of Japanese workers, but later it becomes clear that everything on the screen is propaganda and no picture is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film essentially uses the old system of reading morality, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of action but are etched in stone. It's probably just me, but I find this type of superficial and preconceived art, even when it comes to the noble pursuit (no sarcasm here) of protecting the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a capital sin. when a film is stretched without any justification, for the sole purpose of stretching it. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could have been easily adjusted in 75 minutes, but has a painful duration of 2 hours to 1/4. Yes, there was some interesting shots, but there was not enough to leave 15-minute holes without notice. The film has no standard script and there is no evolution of the characters, but it is not a documentary either, it is rather a kind of conceptual installation. It's an unusual form for a film, but it can still be considered an art, even if the concept is as simple and na√Øve as it is here. OTOH I also think the director should have been honest and did not pretend he could be played in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the score usually sounded like whale sounds. It's surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
