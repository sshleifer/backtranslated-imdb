This is the first Japanese film about the guinea pig and it's the sickest, in my opinion. A group of guys tortured a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! These are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they hit the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they hit and stick the floor near the girl! And how stupid! Sound effects are also unrealistic and have no meaning. Other scenes include animal bowels thrown at the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, tearing nails, worms placed on wounds in the girl's body, pierced eye and mutilated horribly, etc. Very sick and nasty film and absolutely nothing of value or significant on the cinematic level. This first entry is the sickliest and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pigs: Devil's Experience is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to snuff. This is still (of course) a fake (n / t) uff, the only difference with a real "snuff" is that no one dies or actually suffers in this movie. I can not recommend it to anyone because it is so repulsive. Those who consider it to be a big horror movie do not understand anything about cinema and its real meaning. I looked at it like a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant this garbage is. They work only at the shock level and this is not a very valuable cinematographic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So, these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
