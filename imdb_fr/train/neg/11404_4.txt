It's a bit fascinating to me that so many critics consider it a masterpiece. I'm not an idiot when it comes to quality movies, and I agree that from a technical point of view, as well as for many of the characters represented, the film is in a class worthy of a price. But there is no sense (for me) that this film goes anywhere; I mean, take the viewer anywhere. It's a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more than one movie. I am looking for a story, a movement and an achievement of arrival that I did not find in this film. Yes, it could be considered poetry on film. . . but there is a lot of poetry with which I can not live for the same reason: he paints images without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One more thing to say is that it documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally dismayed by what a young British boy had to live at that time and place. Having grown up in America a decade earlier, I can say with authority that the contrast is immense. I can not help wondering if this contrast has had an effect on the favorable reviews of the film. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its "filmic magic" (which I admit to be there) and to completely ignore its irrelevance to the nature of the experience actually remembered ?
