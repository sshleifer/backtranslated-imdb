<br /> <br /> In his youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade him. Several decades later, the elderly man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister gets bored with brother # 1 and jumps into the bed of brother # 2. <br /> <br /> One would think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no, they are Europeans of the upper class who go to university and are busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a moment of seduction between an unrelated woman and the two brothers. We never see a flirting moment between an unrelated man and the only sister. All flirtating moments are shared only between brothers and sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was incest. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a town populated by married daughters, but no, he only wanted his sister? If incest in the movies is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE will make you (gently) enthuse it.
