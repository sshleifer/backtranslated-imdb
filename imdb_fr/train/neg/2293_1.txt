If this series is supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I think that it has failed terribly. The character drawing is ugly ... (Catwoman, for example, looks awful ...) But what really bothered me is that Batman looks like a kind of wimp that does not just can not take care of himself in a battle. using two or even three acolytes. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know comics, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's allies, besides Robin, but still ... have Batman say that he needs help from him ... What he can not handle a few punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen opponents without any problem ... He's getting older? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And something else: I really do not think Batman would allow a child like Tim Drake to go into battle anytime soon, without years of intensive training. First, it's irresponsible (and Batman, that's all, but irresponsible), and secondly, it's not what happened in comics, if we want to stay true to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series marked the story, with its animation, its stories and its characters ... It was really a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series turned the legend into another Batman movie.
