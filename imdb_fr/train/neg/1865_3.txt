Well, what can I say, there are category B films and there are category B films and that definitely falls into the last one. However, as it is obvious that even filmmakers know that it is not a credible movie (look at the closing credits), it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that of a murderer qualified for psychopathic murder. He accidentally mixed his genetic material with an experimental acid that was combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This film has no real fright and its effects alone remind me of the B-Grade movies of the 50s. This alone is worth watching for laughter. A movie to pass the time.
