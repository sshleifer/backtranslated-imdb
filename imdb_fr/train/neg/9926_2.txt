I just watched the 30th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites of all time !! The television pilot for stinking Black Bart. The plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to take advantage of the success of Blazing Saddles and some TV shows managed to take off great movies, but it would never have worked. Considering that for so many years television did not even want to play the noises of farting when she televised the film, it is inconceivable that they thought they could go on television with the word "N". By cons, I liked seeing many familiar faces! There have been quite a few actors / actresses that I have recognized other shows over the years. I had to write all the names and do some research. It was fun. I was arguing with my mother about whether Steve Landesberg was Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
