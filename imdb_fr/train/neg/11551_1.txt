Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this shit party. Randolph Scott, a closet homosexual who has lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is at his worst and boring in any role. At 57, he was way too old for those romantic roles, although that does not really matter here, because Gail Russell looks much older than her 31 years old and she's so ugly because of her alcoholism chronic and its smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual naughty role but that is not enough to save this trash. Thank goodness, they're no longer western, they're just dated, old racist movies glorifying guns and murders. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
