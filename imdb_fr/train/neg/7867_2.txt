Okay, I tried and tried, but I still can not get that Guy Maddin thing. The stories of the Gimli Hospital left me cold, this movie about the Austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph was pretty, but was missing in the story department ... and this nude film about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm happy that Maddin enjoys the silent movie, but I do not like his films for the same reason as Quentin Tarantino's films: they are empty tributes to better, more imaginative films - movies that have changed the form artistic or that burst. new terrain - and are all style and no substance. No difference in strange jumps and camera angles can conceal the fact that Maddin is a non-original David Lynch, although he has an advantage over Tarantino: he usually does not write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films are based on intertitles. The result is that Maddin's film is a smart movie for future cinemas.
