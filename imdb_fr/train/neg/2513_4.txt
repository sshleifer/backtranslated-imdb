When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it should come from the kids section - it's a lot of fun and sometimes funny, and it's actually a good story, but it's sorely lacking of "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the role of Albert Einstein and that his performance is extraordinary, but this is the only exception. This film seems a bit forced, the staging lacks substance, and oh yeah ... the music is ridiculously terrible, it did not put me in a very good mood. But if you do not expect a comedy or a well-crafted love story, then this can certainly be entertaining, as I said ... it should be in the kids section. Einstein and his friends are a relief for Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflictual film, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
