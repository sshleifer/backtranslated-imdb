Dannielynn Smith's obsession with ET is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she will most likely become psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and her desire for confidentiality. Now, poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo has become a loner and says, "I want to be alone." How much is he doing this little girl? AND does he have nothing better to report? I bet a lot of people make fun of the color of his birthday cake and his balloons. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nichole has ever been successful in court for her will and legacy. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be AND?
