I love this book since my grade 5 teacher read it in class many years ago. And I read it in each of my 3rd and 5th grade classes in my last 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a film had been made in the past, but I had never been able to locate it. My students and I were so excited to hear that Disney had presented Madeline L'Engle's excellent book on screen. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie, I had the greatest hopes. Over the course of the film, I became more and more dejected. They had missed it! I had never been so disappointed by a book adaptation to favorite movie. I understand that movies can not stick strictly to a book, but they do not need to change things for fun! Most, if not all, departures of the book were totally useless! <br /> <br /> At first, I kept my opinion for myself and I just listened to my students discuss the movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same - deceived by the beautiful story Madeline L'Engle had so cleverly created! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the movie Star Wars? Why did not Calvin have red hair? Why Madame who did not have the "witch" outfit that was so good at playing her name? Basically, we all wondered why we had to change almost every detail. <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed of the wonderful film that this book would do. I'm still waiting for this movie. This one was a ride in time in the broadest sense. I will write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over!
