Cannon has achieved a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems fascinating (with the exception of the dragon propeller). Now, how has the long-known studio for Chuck Norris's films been able to come to a total lack of knowledge in the first place? Example: the amateur acting game and the horrible plot is a sign that the rebirth of medieval legend does not heal an ugly performance. In fact, they created another cheap operator featuring hundreds of sturdy bimbos, just to make the look even better. For the two "barbaric brothers", they know how to make strange noises than to become brave warriors so powerful and daring to save their native country. It's the biggest waste of potential I've seen in an "expensive" low-budget movie, and far enough to let an ax crash into the beautiful, merciless print. All of this follows an advertising campaign selling t-shirts inspired by THE BARBARIANS! The film alone makes a good memory!
