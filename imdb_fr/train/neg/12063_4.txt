The husbands of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars of the vaudeville, but they turned very little. As is the case for some other artists of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible film sequence for Fields and Seeley is the biographical film that describes them, in which they are described by other actors: "Someone Loves Me", starring Betty Hutton and Ralph Meeker, this man of inimitable song and dance. <br /> <br /> In their hour of glory, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another vaudeville between husband and wife - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - reached almost the same celebrity by making an almost identical number, becoming the "second team" Fields and Seeley. Outside the wings, there was a major difference in the living conditions of couples. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying the room service fee for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and wisely invested their earnings, ending in a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this short film Vitaphone are occupied by two pianists wearing gaiters. Apparently, these two men had a small nominal value in 1930, although I never heard of it. Finally, Fields and Seely rush and start playing. They both have a lot of pep and she is quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that the two artists continue to make movements as if they were about to dance, but they will never do it before the third of the three songs they interpret in this short film. When they finally start sabotaging, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to have the opportunity to see these two major performers make their vaude number. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in musicals. My note for this one: only 4 out of 10, and I will stay with Block and Sully.
