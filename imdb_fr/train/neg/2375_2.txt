Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and again a bad sequel. I think this is related to the last sequel to Dream Child. I was lucky enough to receive the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD set for my birthday so I could see all the suites. May I say that I am more and more disappointed with these consequences, at least these last two years, it seems to me that Freddy has lost his advantage. It's almost as if writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and destroy it instead of reinventing the story. It was a useless sequel, sorry for Robert Englund, but it was way below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know, a girl. Maggie, she does not know he is his father, but she quickly discovers what are his darkest secrets and he needs his help. She must do her best to resist her powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her beloved father. Ironic, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating it. <br /> <br /> The death of Freddy: The last nightmare is also presented in 3D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst suites, it is related to the fifth sequel to the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I prefer to watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. It just had a bad acting, a stupid editing, and just a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept and it completely ruined the idea of ​​who is Freddy Krueger, the master of the death of nightmares, and not the father knows the best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
