HERA PHERI from Priyadarshan was a beautiful situation comedy. This film lacks history, but it is quite funny but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not a story to speak of, but it manages somehow a good flow, although it's not extraordinary <br /> <br /> The first half includes 2 fun scenes, like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring but the second half is funnier even if it's not a script <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny, but one wonders how they never hear the voice of everyone from the inside of the pieces? <br /> <br /> The confusion between the highlights is treated as a play but it's quite funny But the film ends abruptly <br /> <br /> The direction is correct The music is good < Akshay Kumar excels in his part which has now become his second skin, but his film completely and he eclipses everyone. <br /> <br /> John stumbles and fails in comedy Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal goes well Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (we only see Neetu) are good at times, but shout too often Manoj Joshi is fine
