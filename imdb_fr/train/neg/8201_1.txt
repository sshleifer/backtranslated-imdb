Sit comfortably in your favorite chair and turn on the game console while throwing it into the garbage disposal unit. Spend 90 useful minutes. live your favorite game. Disjointed - poorly filmed - unwanted junk. It takes a bit of several other "science fiction" movies and tries hard to join the parties in a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would make a monetary game, but a touch of ingenuity and talent is needed to make a good movie. Any money spent looking at this is wasteful, and personally, I would like to find my 90 minutes of life.
