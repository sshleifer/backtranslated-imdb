I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK to see it without waiting forever for it to arrive in the United States. I really should have saved my money. What makes Anne run after Wentworth? Anne Elliot's character lies in the fact that she was calm and refined. She is neither impulsive nor vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? His speech was not normal, nor was it normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made their "romance" completely unbelievable. In the final scene, Sally Hawkins wears the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the letter's scene. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version which, despite its flaws, remained very close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. It's a bit like a persuasive film from Cliff's Notes. Hit on all the strong points without explaining anything.
