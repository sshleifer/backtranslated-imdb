In 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a galaxy far or near. He was trying to finish a movie with the title THX, etc. This short film is a remanufactured story of a certain George. I'm sorry he's only kind to defend him. This is simply an advertisement for the director, the actors, and. Al. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It's a brochure. George's main role is very good, as is the character of Leia and ersatz character Darth. All the rest is just commercial slag. Such a waste. Yet the work has been done, I suppose. The rest of the movie just stomp the water to kill time, I guess. a brochure only.
