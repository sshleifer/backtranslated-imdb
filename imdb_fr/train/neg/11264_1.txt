I have not decided yet whether this would replace Anaconda as "The worst film I have ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore shady accents, low production values ​​and appalling camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing for it. I only went to see him when I read the book, and I wanted to see how they would integrate the complicated plot into a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is: they did not do it. The characters appear with little or no explanation, and then play no important role in the story. Even the main characters act for no reason, so by the time the film reaches its peak, you do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books have to be rewritten sometimes to fit into movies and that it may be unfair to judge this movie from the book it is adapting. But after my friends and I were out of the movies, I had to spend most of the trip home to explain what was supposed to have happened. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the title of the book "Rancid Aluminum" by pressing it into another piece of useless voice to allow the film to have a cool title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of a film, from beginning to end.
