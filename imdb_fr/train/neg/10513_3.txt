This film was a loss of an hour and a half of my time. I usually like cheap monster horror movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main flaw is the lack of explanation of the creatures. When they came into the house and found the man he could at least explain to them, he explained them. He does not really say anything about them except that they killed his parents, and unless I miss something, he did not explain how he managed to escape either. talk about the fact that this gives no indication only the survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near-death experience. It would have seemed she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "crossover incident".
