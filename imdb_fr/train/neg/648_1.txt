The night of prom: the most important night for a shallow girl made up almost entirely of plastic. Thus, the characters constantly reminded us every ten minutes when a tiny event, tiny and touching the head, occurred. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original and I would have really given zero star or less if it was possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I appreciated was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of "ghosts". It was much more exciting than anything on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was essentially a type that was unleashed. And the problem was that it was not even a slightly exciting outburst. Maybe if the guy had been scared by far rather than looking sober with Robbie Williams with a baseball cap, I might have sat a little anxiously. The fact that I care less about the characters than the color of the movie mat did not really add any effect. And to make matters worse, the other characters were also unidimensional and unconscious. The hotel staff did not seem to care that one of the maids was missing and is further proof that a murderer is unrecognizable after shaving. I was incredibly surprised to find that the stereotypical, blue-bitch girl was the only person to notice who he was. She realizes it and then falls down the stairs, gets caught in a sheet of plastic, then spills a pile of paint buckets. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that I'm convinced that the director was doing his best. He really pushed all the limits by not showing any massacres in progress. Shocking! And the music, do not even throw me. It was almost as appropriate as undressing at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really want Prom Night to be a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. Nobody, in his mind or otherwise, has reason to see this film. The mainstream cinema seems to be deteriorating and films like this are worsening the situation. If you want to see this absolutely awful movie, listen to my call. Do not do it. There is better to spend six pounds. Like a leaf with which to play ghosts.
