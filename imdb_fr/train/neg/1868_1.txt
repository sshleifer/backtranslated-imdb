This film is terrible. Each line is stolen at 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like rubbish ... the real waste, try it; but beware: it's not the kind of movie "so bad it's good". In its economic state, it can really look like a porn but, believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go looking for something else! I tell you, because the shooting, the action, the plot, the dialogues absolutely without inspiration and without conviction (the only good things, as I said before, are the ones they stole in the 8 MM from Joel Schumacher!) You will be bored with tears. a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely disgusting! I'll give him a star: a half for the shot in the backstage, after the monologue "The eyes of the victim" (stolen at 8MM too) and a half for the sexy bodies of mom and daughter (who do not did not succeed to keep me fully awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
