In keeping with Disney's well-known flying practice ... I mean ... by redeeming and building known properties, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic must be one of the worst revisions of this year. remake. I grew up in the original TV cartoon series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than any movie. Not present is Penny's cool computer book. The gag with self-destructive orders that always ends up exploding on the leader is also not present. The novelties are a gadget convertible that speaks well (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or car) and an element of a typical and unrealistic romance in Hollywood. Do not fill the chests to pay Disney's executives and even their _ex_executives - do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
