It's not just the plot that makes this movie a moment of carelessness for a bored audience. It's terrible direction with a horrible scenario and errors left and right that makes it too scary to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the "pleasure" in all this. Just the pleasure of pointing out the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well, I wonder how filmmakers think of their production company when this film was first shown. Probably as stupid as this sheriff who plunged into the van filled with antifreeze with a bloody wound gaping. Oops! Have I forgotten to mention that this sheriff is not only a bad actor, but can also avoid an impal with antifreeze load soaking exposed flesh? I guess he sort of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.
