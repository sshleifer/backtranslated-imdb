A very low-budget police detective movie about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman found in a stolen car in Central Park. Their only clue is a tattoo on the arm. Although published by RKO, this looks like an independent production that has been taken over by the studio for distribution. The actors and the crew, with a few exceptions - among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, the director Edward Montagne and the cameraman William Steiner - are composed of complete strangers, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-equal and could not be compared to a high school movie, the direction is heavy and jerky and, as mentioned before, there is no chemistry between the main actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it presents some positive points. The shooting in New York and the extremely low budget of the film give it an authenticity reminiscent of the very superior "The Naked City", a shooting in a dark basement is managed in a decent way, and some investigation procedures are intelligent . Otherwise, it's not much to write at home. However, it's worth taking a look at some of New York's upscale neighborhoods in the early 1950s. Older car enthusiasts will be thrilled to see legions of cars from the '30s and' 40s on the streets. > <br />
