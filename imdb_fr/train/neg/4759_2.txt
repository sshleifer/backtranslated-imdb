In the name of Pinter, every knee will bow, especially after its speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which only regurgitated an anti-Americanism sixth, in number, numbered. But it's even worse. Not only is it a tour de force without talent, a superb example of how to escape your reputation gained decades ago, but it is also the butchery of a superb play. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical outfit, and it's easy to see how its central plot device would work better on the stage than on the screen, but it still worked terribly well. It's a vanity of Michael Caine, but let's face it, Caine is not Olivier. Not only could he not fill Larry's shoes, he could not even fill his bathroom slippers. Caine, who is aptly named, is, after all, a very average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity. It was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but it's your lot, buddy! Give it a very wide place and respect the beautiful original. This is more than half a pinter.
