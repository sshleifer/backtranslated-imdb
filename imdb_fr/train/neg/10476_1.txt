I am Christian. I've always been skeptical about movies made by Christians, though. In general, they are "connoisseurs" of film production. I admire TBN for trying to portray God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a hideous job. The acting was awful and if we did not know the Bible in one way or another, we could NOT understand what the film was trying to convey. Not only was the film done in a terrible way, but the people who shot it were even wrong. However, in this "criticism", these facts are irrelevant and too deep to be deepened. In short, the Omega code is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone except comic relief of everyday life.
