Thanks to this film, I can now answer the following question: "What is the worst film you have ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can not even think of a second close and I have seen bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. Name a single element of a horror movie and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here is a typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, it's you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, it's not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARGGH !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
