The title should have been "The walker". It was only that he was walking. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good in the film. The description of the film does not really correspond to the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can understand from the movie is that he was a good son, but a terrible person, with a weak life. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry for spending my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the film. I stayed in the hope that it will be better ... what an error. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If it is suggested to the producer to reorient his life in another field, to make the cinema is certainly not his cup of tea
