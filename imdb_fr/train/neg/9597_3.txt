Even though I like Japanese movies, this one did not just cut it. A film supposed to be about the rebels and the survival of a royal lineage, turned out to be a very slow-moving film with a dubious intrigue. The photography is correct, although I've seen much better scenes of sword fights in other Japanese movies, fast cameras and their way of following the characters did not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice its presence.But the worst is the way the plot has evolved. I must admit that sometimes I had trouble understanding who was who and what was going on. In any case, the platonic love between the main character and another was completely useless and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a Japanese action movie, that's not it. It's very slow, with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental ... in the wrong way ...
