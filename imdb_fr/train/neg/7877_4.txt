The filmmakers have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in all states, but women are also being prosecuted for murder and sentenced to long prison terms. In other words, this movie is the Liberals' worst nightmare! The political agenda is so busy here and the style of the film is so discreet that it quickly loses its vigor. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, I recommend that you skip it.
