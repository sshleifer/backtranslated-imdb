Christ. Following one of the most disgusting movies of all time, he at least has the decency to leave out the songs (except for a resumption of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but he maintains the tradition of being nauseating and without fantasy. This time, Annie and her friends go to London and embark on the plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or something like that. The film has an oddly sycophant attitude towards his eponymous character, in contradiction with his irritation: every time, the little guy yells "Leapin 'lizards!" I could feel my teeth being reduced to powder. Sadly photographed, slimy and stomping, the film has only one memorable line ("Give me, silly genius!") And the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.
