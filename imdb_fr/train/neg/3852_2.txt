It was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen ?? I do not really know why ?? Just your mundane stories about a guy who is about to get married and starts to love someone else instead. The story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time, when this type of actor / actress meets to make a movie that has already been shot a million times before, it's really fun. There is usually one smart thing in them that is not really in another. For some reason, this one just does not hold your attention. You can choose fun parties or clever ideas, but for some reason they are just not funny or smart in any way? I would like to know how to explain it, but this is not the case ?? Just do not waste your time on this one ??
