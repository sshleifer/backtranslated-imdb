Nobody, if anyone, could engrave a landscape like that of the Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a great example. Even if she sometimes plays too often in this part, watch her when she notices that Raliegh wrote the lyrics of a song that her maids of honor are about to play: at that moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to govern and rule absolutely! At other times, she is finished with the vanity of the screenplay. When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she is weak and lean. This has the additional effect of undermining her authority: when she hits her rug and threatens to do justice, it's hard to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, which makes us see how Essex could verminize his way into Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally unable to convey the absolute complexity and evil of man. It does not help either that Essex is badly subscribed. Why is he this burned-out head who wants to overthrow his queen - even as he swears his fidelity - except that he is more blue, therefore more "worthy" of the rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting him with Essex's letters? He is not in danger of falling out of favor and we know where Essex (and his head) is going. So why is he risking his own head by speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the $$$ he received? He does not even bother trying to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage. He should have done with Elizabeth the first time alone at La Tour; all that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is useless. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me or Bette exactly like Susan Sarandon?
