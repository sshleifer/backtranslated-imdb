Raymond Burr plays the role of a lawyer involved in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) because of his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a full year before he started playing Perry Mason. The film could therefore be of particular interest to his fans if he was inspired by his casting. <br /> <br /> There is not much else here interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but his character here is very one-dimensional and the motives of his crime in the mystery are totally obvious. Lamont Johnson has made an interesting performance as a painter who is also in love with the "femme fatale", but the character of Burr is rather simple. It's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr shoot these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his interrupted performance does not fit his character perfectly well, as in most movies in which I've seen him. There is really no mystery The title of the film and how the character of Burr installs the character of Lansbury in order to get involved (the double jeopardy prevents him from being judged again for the original murder, presumably ). He does it with a very big tape recorder that she does not notice when she enters the room, I suppose. <br /> <br /> A few moments maybe fun and involuntary and the rest of the thing could have been done for TV.
