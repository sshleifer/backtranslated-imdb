Ok, I wrote a scathing review because the movie is awful. While I waited for another criticism (for Derrida) to me, I decided to consult the old critics of this horrible film. Look at all the positive reviews. They all, I say all, originated from contributors rated no other film than this one. Crimminy! and expect the criticism of "rosebud" [sic]. <br /> <br /> Check out other Rosebud movies reviewed with commendable recommendations. Oh, shoot!, These are the only other films of the two writers and the director. Batman. Holy, windshield wipers. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you're void as writers, and Tony, you can not lead from a bad scenario. No work for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK FOR POSITIVE ADVICE FOR AN EVOLVED FILM!
