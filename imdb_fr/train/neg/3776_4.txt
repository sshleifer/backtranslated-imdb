Believe me, I wanted to love "Spirit". The silly comments that people made when it came out on the charm of seeing an old-fashioned, hand-drawn animation again, as if the last pencil cartoon had been published twenty years ago, and comments still more stupid about how computers had made the old techniques obsolete, had my blood ... but then, the insulting and untainted banality that I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" gave me even more blood. <br /> <br /> The design of the characters is generic, the animation (partly due to this) is just competent, the artistic direction as a whole is so, boringly dull that you wonder how it could have happened (We know, from "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Road to El-Dorado", the number of talented artists at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is in any case misjudged. (Why are they worried?) There is not one thing that deserves to be WATCHED. In a cartoon, it's fatal. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> The horses can not talk, but they are much more anthropomorphized and less convincing than the deer in "Bambi", which can . And it seems that, in a way, horses can talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (which resembles a 21st century actor chosen from a shopping mall in California), and his casual and resolutely equestrian narration is barely absent from the soundtrack, although it has not never tells us everything we did not already know, or expresses a feeling that the work, however poor it may be, was not capable of expressing twice as much. This prologue, in passing: (a) contains information that the Spirit, we will discover later, knew the way to know it; (b) expresses ideas that the Spirit would not have the power to express even though he COULD speak; (c) includes new age garbage such as "this story may not be true, but that's what I remember"; and (d) give to countless children (the production is started, I presume, at the age of six) the impression that the horses are from North America, which is a little bit true, in that that the common ancestor of domestic horses, the zebras was native to North America - but all the horse species on the continent had become extinct long before the arrival of the first humans, and the mustangs of the Spirit herd (which would have "belonged here as buffalo grass") were derived from horses introduced by Europeans. <br /> <br /> The prologue so annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Bryan Adams sings as often as Spirit says, as if he has a severe throat infection - and it's not THAT he's singing or even HOW he's singing, that's WHAT He sings: maudlin narrative ballads that contribute even less, if possible, than the spoken word of Spirit, and that sound as if they all have exactly the same melody (although I am very attentive, and was able to discern what they probably did not). If only Bryan Adams and the guy claiming to be a horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two, the film could have taken its true form: mediocre and derivative, rather than stupid.
