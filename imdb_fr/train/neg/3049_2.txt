Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. Before that, movies were trying to capitalize on the holiday spirit, especially "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", was at least entertaining to watch because of his kindness and all the shorts used ... for whatever reason, seemed happy for me. But this movie only screw Christmas in the buttocks and empty the joy of all children. Santa lives in space? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa Claus gets help from the magician Merlin? How is this random! Well, since the film was made in Mexico, some of you may understand how the film was shot. I had to admit that some of the effects were just crazy at the moment. It was a heap of madness! Although despite all the problems with the movie, it still looks like a Christmas movie. The good conquers the evil and Christmas always plays in the heart of every good girl or boy of the world, even of the universe, thanks to Santa Claus conquers the Martians ... apparently. So I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... even if it should make you smile every day.
