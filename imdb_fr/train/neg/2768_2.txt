This movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any of the characters and the scenario was played horribly. He was a well-defined sleeper. You expect action scenes in a film like this to be its strengths, but D-Wars surprises you even with disappointment in this department. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting was only one step more than the level of a low budget porn movie. And I think it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the end credits on this one because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in a crappy movie like D-Wars.
