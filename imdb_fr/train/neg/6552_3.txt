Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) wandered in a desert after the apocalypse (after his protector died of old age, said protector was played by Elias Koteas, a decent actor) the rubble looking for cyborgs to exchange scrap and money. She leads a group of exhausted cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes on the screen as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it's still a largely boring feature. The problem this time is that potential ideas are never well used, action sequences are routine and names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan have little to do. Haje is indeed a whining heroine and Lynch is too exaggerated (as usual) and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be as much fun as its hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) The angle of science fiction is also disappointing. He almost aggressively resists any good idea he has. As an action film, it's routine and, from the numbers, it's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4- (Poor)
