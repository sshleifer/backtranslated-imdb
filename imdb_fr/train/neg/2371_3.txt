I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other films Nightmare on Elm Street. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays better But it does not matter, Robert, this film is bad. The acting is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that deserves to be watched. Sometimes the sequels can be better on Friday the 13th (I thought the remake was the Best of the series.) But this is not one of these films. The original was good, the 2nd in my opinion was better, the 3rd was fine but I did not see the others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake as me by watching this piece of shit.
