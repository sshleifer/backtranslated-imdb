Let's see ... I try to find the positive in everything, so what about nice about the wearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it will not work because they managed to get rid of all the personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> > Oh, how's the story going? It's not going to fly either, because it was sleepy. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny, it excludes comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can not be sure - just call it "losers like". I'm sure those behind this film started with a vision, I mean, they probably had one to present to the studio costumes, but I need help finding it. <br /> <br /> Even though I was a patient person who could forgive the sheer stupidity of the story, I could not, in good conscience, recommend a movie that would allow a guy to enter an interview professional job with a windbreaker and messy hair, fluffy and stupid. Speaking of hair, are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum wicks worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I've already lost 97 irremediable minutes in watching the movie - I can not devote any more time to this loser.
