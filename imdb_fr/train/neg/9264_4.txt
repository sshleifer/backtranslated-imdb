This inferior suite based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns a marriage named Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York about re-electing for congressman and he chairs the funding committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be present when inexplicable deaths occur. It creates havoc at a metaphysical fair, while stores of numerology, therapy, healing tips, yoga, tarot, among others, are destroyed. Karen York hires a private investigator (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV show features strong emotions, thrills, terrifying events and bloody murders. Delia, like Damien, seems to be launching new, strange murders every few minutes of the movie, producing horrific murders. The main excitement lies in seeing what new innocent victims can be caused by poor special effects. In addition, the mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, albeit secondary, like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the late Don S Davis, were an army captain turned actor. As always, excellent musical score taken by Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The movie is exclusively for hardcore Omen saga fans. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and much better versions are: The immensely superior original "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; Don Taylor's "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant); "Final Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Note: Below average.
