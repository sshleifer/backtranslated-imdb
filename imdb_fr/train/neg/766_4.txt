Whenever a Columbo story departs from the usual plot (a colorful killer commits a crime, Columbo smokes the killer, Columbo becomes a parasite in the process), writers are never able to match the quality and the interest of most traditional episodes. This episode departs to the extreme and the result is a major fiasco. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbo will never face the villain until the end? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to extinguish it by about two thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we make ourselves, reviewers !!!
