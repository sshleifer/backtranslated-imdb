I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a total loss of two hours, the line of intrigue was thin and confusing, the prestigious gamut of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. The work of the camera was somewhat experimental in some places and although we can see what the director was trying to convey, it made viewing even more difficult. One of the most boring aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narration in the film, almost as if the entire plot was dictated to the public. The best performances have nothing to do with acting. In fact, the most convincing performance is probably that of Dani Behr, although it is true that she plays the role of stereotyped desktop secretary. In no case will you see this movie unless you need a reason to catch some sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
