Yes, I rated this film as a horrible star. Yet it will now be in my Christmas movie rotation. It's a shame, it's good. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: buys a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, does not spend money to dub it in English and airs it at kiddie mornings in the mid-1960s.) I'm sure that some "mood enhancing agents" will make it an even better experience. I'm not going to go back to what so many other critics have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, The Devil, a mechanical reindeer and some of the most pathetic kids actors I've ever seen. I plan to do this during the holidays, along with Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". Really a holiday experience made in hell. Now, if I can only find "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I will have a triple unbeatable feature. You must see this movie. It moves so slowly that I challenge you not to touch the button fast forward, especially on the two dance routines! This thing stinks like an expensive blue cheese-suppose you have to bypass the stench to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
