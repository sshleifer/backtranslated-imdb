Hmm, Hip Hop music in a western era. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to follow. "The sistahs are in the house" !? Manicured French nails on overlapping girls. The microphone packs are clearly visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I just can not continue with the litany of mistakes made by the director and the editors. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not as bad as I've ever seen it. The women were doing pretty well with a mediocre scenario. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speak with his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. Fabulous costumes but completely wrong. I just can not believe they're doing their part for what could have been a great story. I would be offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such attributes that it could be played in the downtown area. <br /> <br />
