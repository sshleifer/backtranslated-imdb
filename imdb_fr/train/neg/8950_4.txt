I heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends recommended me to read it. I looked for it everywhere and finally found it. It's a book that every man should read, because it's a genius and a vision. I enjoyed each page. <br /> <br /> I knew the movie and I could not wait to see it. When I finally did it, I was very disappointed. Many of the things that are in the book are not in the film (I do not think it's a spoiler) that just makes the film not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as a book follower. The film is not at all dark, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is the acting. John Hurt is an incredible actor and the only face I could see myself as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What annoys me the most is the IMDb members who have called this project "best possible adaptation" without even reading the book. ! Or know everything about writing on screen! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the beauty of the story by reading the book, do not consider it as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this film go to the role of actor.
