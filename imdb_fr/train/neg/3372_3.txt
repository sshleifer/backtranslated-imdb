A pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the end of the musical, "opens" it unnecessarily and confuses the scope of the play. The show talks about a group of dancers auditioning for work in a B'way musical and examines their motivation and desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding area. Attenborough presents us with a group of fresh hopefuls, assuming they are trying to get their "big hit" in show business, rather than presenting the more refined mix of characters created on stage in the form of a group of " gypsies "alive, with some newcomers. The film has an advantage over the play: the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the actual scale of the withdrawal up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupidly excluded from the line in the film). Anyone who can watch a local civic opera-light production will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly crafted movie.
