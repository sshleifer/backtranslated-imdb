This movie seems to have a lot of people saying it's one of the most brutal of all time. After viewing it, I can say that it does not correspond to these affirmations. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is indeed crazy. But overall, the execution was not crazy at all. Even the final scene (the eyeball) is not so nasty. I was expecting something crazy, but instead, it was of lower quality than the one shown in movies like the very small Violent Sh budget! T. <br /> <br /> There is no story (although most people probably know it). The fans of Gore will be disappointed because, contrary to what we think, blood and guts are rare. Not to mention the actress playing the victim could be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it's just nil. Avoid it.
