I guess the reason this film was so successful at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" so at the time he was sexy. Considering that this one made more than two hundred million and that it was R and that it made about 80 million and it was said that it was not so popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I did not care at all. This one has Eddie as a sort of finder of lost children. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as serious as it is, it does not compare to the special effects. In the 70s, I had seen better than what it offers, Ray Harryhausen has done better. Still, the main reason you see a movie like this is Eddie. Unfortunately, it is not very funny in this one and it seems just stupid to place it in the scenes of the type "The adventurers of the lost arch". I guess they were hoping for a fishy effect out of the water, but for me it did not work.
