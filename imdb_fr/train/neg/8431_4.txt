Although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers scrolling on the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify allowed me to watch my watch 20 minutes only after the beginning of the film (and more than once after). The development of the plot is inconsistent and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is virtually unbearable, the basic quality of most of the actions of the characters and the cavalier manner they deal with is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Ventura Pons to put forward characters that are grossly handicapped psychologically. However, this false sociological analysis is a big step forward compared to CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters abuse and despise each other for well-founded reasons that appear during the film. At AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow the meanders of a genuinely inferior intelligence while tracking down an extremely depressed and detached woman. Supposedly this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support it. I will not reveal the rest of the story in case there are masochists ?? Is he cured by his obsession or is the woman shocked by her own depression by her unwavering attention? Even though I watched everything I did not think I could do even for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you can face all these prejudices, this ignorance, this treason, this bad dialogue, this fragile philosophy, etc ?? the work of the camera was pretty good and seems to be inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to aim to show these players a raw light and granular, because it is the worst I saw Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in one of his films (while it is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose that if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so that we can be grateful for not being part of it, then Pons has achieved its goal. The barrage of almost identical sex scenes was a real mess of movie (if the actors had been filmed but once dressed in blue-green clothes, the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a ridiculous price). It is true that I heard a lot of the male audience squirm in their place during this session, but an objective viewing proves that it was not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Register and look at something else.
