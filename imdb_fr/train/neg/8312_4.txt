The idea of ​​the thumb is not such a winner of the second round. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. First of all, I think, Mr. Oedekerk had a lot less to do with the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic is not (yet?) Become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to make that will resonate in the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled unique jokes that do not seem really related to anything. For example, the insinuation of the hero that the heroine is not clean during the scene of "landing the ship" - it's not funny. Instead, you simply say, "Did I forget something in the original movie?" There were too many such baseless jokes (see arachnid). <br /> <br /> On the other hand, sending the ship designer Smarmy made sense and was funny. What was also very funny was the incident of the guy in the movie who wanted to go "faster" like a current maniac demanding everything * be "faster", including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These jokes made sense in the context of the Titanic and gave Thumbtanic a significant sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The "media" of the thumb, faces and voices are always fun. The accessories, the sets and the animation of CG deserve to be appreciated. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that weirdness is not enough, this film still keeps you amused and giggling to the end.
