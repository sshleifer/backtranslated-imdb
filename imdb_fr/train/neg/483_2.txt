I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but I was obviously wrong. As previously stated, this film essentially uses the character of its title as a starting point; his portrait of his life and his person has little or nothing to do with the true Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The scenario is dreadful - pretentious, scalded and tasteless - and its rewrite of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that too often earns its life by distorting rather by telling the story. With some decent decors, the physical charms of Valentina Cervi are the main asset of this film, and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this; they do not waste time creating various "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with titillation than with the development of plot or character. Unfortunately, seeing a pretty girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal can not and does not support this film. The acting is unremarkable, and the score is too generic despite an interesting agreement or two. The cinematography is fine and there are pretty colors, but there are also quite ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects that are more suited to a spooky film of the 1960s than to a drama in costume. In any case, the scenario too often leaves the camera lodged on the body of Artemisia and too rarely on his paintings. <br /> <br /> All in all, almost complete failure. It's not smart enough or stylish enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to make pornography sweet. So the French can fail, after all!
