.... And after seeing this pile of shit, you will not be surprised that it was not published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> It's a dreadful movie, but when I point out that it's one of the worst films named Stephen King in the credits, you can start to imagine how bad it is bad is. The film begins with two characters open-mouthed in front of a horror scene: <br /> <br /> "My god, what happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I do not know but they are sure hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera is panning outside a house where hundreds of cats are chained dead and mutilated. This guy is right, someone hates cats and with such a deduction he should be a policeman. Oh wait a minute, he's a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making such an obvious observation that you know you're going to watch a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that c is very illogical and confused. We finally discover that the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive. Would not they be better looking for a virgin in the West Central Bible Belt than a US coastal city? That said, at least we know the motivations of monsters - that's the only thing we learn. We never learn how they are able to change shape or make cars invisible and this jar with the end that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR. A monster mother walks around killing several police officers with her bare hands or blowing them up with a police firearm (!) But if her monster race is safe from police power, then why should do creatures need to be able to transform themselves or become invisible? The disappearance of creatures is just as badly thought as that killed by a massive attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, then why did not the monsters kill all the cats hanging out in the garden? There was a whole horde of boobs sitting but the monsters never thought of killing them. I guess it's for the production team to come to an end. It's from the moment they started the movie where my complaint is. <br /> <br /> We have seen several scenes in which famous horror directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos. I think the reason is that every time an unknown actor in trouble reads the script, he instantly decided that, in any case, they would not appear in a film as bad as Stephen King's phone his horror buddies to fill their needs. on the casting. SLEEPWALKERS is so bad <br /> <br /> * Amazing because it seems like it was not the worst line of the movie. The worst line is - "This cat saved my life"
