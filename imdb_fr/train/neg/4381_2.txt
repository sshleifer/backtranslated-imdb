It's one of the five worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's not that they did not try. There was a decent writing with some structural elements, good distribution, good actors. I do not know where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may have been a bad structure and no background story, better when restricted), some wrong direction and editing. I had had enough after about an hour, I had pulled off my hair after an hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and half an hour elapsed. There was also a lack of sincerity about all this, that I went with someone who was addicted to heroin. He was agitated to glamorize something that was not good. This was reinforced by the pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the unbridled nature of the trail was diverted enough. There were clumsy plot points that were an attempt at structure, but the end result was apathetic and endless (with unequal time lines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for the quality actors you have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Ignore it. I assumed it was a director for the first time who was seduced by his own problems, but he did it before. I am puzzled to see how this and many other very bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
