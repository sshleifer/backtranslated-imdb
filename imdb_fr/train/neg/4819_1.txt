It's a typical 1970s budget mess. It's supposed to be a documentary about a crew hunting Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the native American to the cynical cowboy. The acting and the narration are a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot videos, keep hoping. There will not be much and you can do in your garden with a cheap suit and a camcorder. it would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like the low fare of the 1970s; I do. It's such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, ugly story and chills that you just can not enjoy. This does not fit into the category "so bad that it's good," and you can not laugh at the gravity of the situation without the help of illicit substances. These are mainly many boring images of people camping, hiking, riding and looking at wildlife. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid; supposedly our friend Sasquatch throws rocks at the campers from above while they shoot their guns at them. At this point, you are firmly encouraging Bigfoot to drop pebbles at the filmmaker's head and stop everything.
