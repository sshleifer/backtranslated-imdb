I really came into this movie with the desire I thought the place had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect Citizen Kane to be caught, I took this for movie B that he is. That said, he still has not met expectations. The historical aspect of the story is enamelled and the end leaves me a little cold. The game in the movie was very wooden. Overall, I give 4 for a good idea, but the film could have been much higher with a little more attention for the fundamentals of filmmaking. Is it worth it to be seen? I did not want my two hours back, but I did not know that I would recommend it to others.
