(aka: The leech leads the dance) <br /> <br /> There are many naked girls in this one with two lesbian scenes. The film is supposed to take place in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to a count's island castle for the weekend. One by one, they seem to lose their head because of a crazy running. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms seem to be lit by spotlights, even if candles are lit. Go understand ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot serves only as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by the European horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, it is a repeater. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 of 10
