This film is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it's funny to say how bad it is .. all the time I watched it, I thought the music would start and the doctor would was dancing .. (I saw some porn with a better plot) When the raptor tried to enter through the door, I think someone threw a plastic doll against the door about 2 feet away . But as I said, it's so serious that you have to look at it so you can see how much he explains to me that he's explaining to me that it will not do anything compared to if you look at it .. I do not recommend renting it, but if it comes on TV watch for about 30 minutes just to see what I mean. I could not watch more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit down during the whole process, then you will have goodwill.
