It is unfortunate that someone decided to produce the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals a lot of material from the first three films, even going as far as reproducing how people die and what will happen to the key characters in the future. It basically tries to split three movies into one and fails. It can not even create a good scary atmosphere for one (except for a few rare exceptions, where impressive choral music brings back memories of old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful for is that he was not an omen.
