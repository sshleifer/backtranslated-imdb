I gave a low score to 'Kôhî jikô' not because it was a bad movie, but because it does not do anything worth congratulating. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for the uninitiated (me included), "Kôhî jikô" is announced as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was made in 1962) The film is an extremely rare work ... containing very few dialogues, stories, music or emotions. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" an unemployed and wandering character who spends his time in his cafe or vaguely investigates a Taiwanese composer she loves. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend, who works in a compact disc store and sometimes lets the interest of otaku for trains. And that's about it. <br /> <br /> We observe Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for a train ... catching a train ... falling asleep on the train. The kind of social reality that everyone in Japan can see daily. It captures these ordinary moments in the lives of these characters, but without any sense for these vignettes, it's a totally useless movie to do or watch.
