It looked like a really interesting movie from the presentation film. Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code, Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychological, from David Lynch. It was actually an advantage. But the way the story is told is really horrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is casting. The character of Andrienne Barbeau begins by being a little shy and frightened. She just does not succeed, even at her age, although she certainly has tried. The actor played the role of the son apparently thought it was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought it was a camper movie, or at least acted that way, rather than just being weird. The only one who seems to have really done well is the girl, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another big part is stimulation. It starts very slowly. So slowly that you might be tempted to turn it off. But then, it becomes convincing for a moment when you get to the girl's suicide and its consequences. But soon after, everything becomes a messy mess. Part of this was voluntary, but much of it was simply confusing, monotonous and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that it's just not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters are nice. Excessive use of images and scenery. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this, it is the spectator who does it. There are some scary moments, especially the Nazi paintings and the credits, but the rest of the film is rather boring.
