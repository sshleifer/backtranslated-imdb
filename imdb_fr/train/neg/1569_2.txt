Low plot, improbable malfunction of the car and helpless characters At first, I thought this film was shot in the seventies, because the quality of the picture, as well as the storyline and the drama seemed drawn from an old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found that it was really done up to -97, I was amazed. This is by far one of the weakest and least thriller films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, know that if you see it, you are wasting time doing something more exciting. like watching the paint dry.
