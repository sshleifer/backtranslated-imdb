I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really want it. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so cheap they are good. A wise ninja scarecrow who can use maize cobs as deadly weapons ... is perfectly suited to this "budget-economy" system. The depth of the film is undoubtedly its strong point and the twists it implements, keeping the audience at the edge of its seats are really the cause of goosebumps ... ninja ... reached puberty ... student under 30 years of age ... drawing non-cowboy ... wise-crunching ... the scarecrow of son of a bitch in the limelight as a horror icon the scariest of the year. All I can really say is "can you dig" and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you like that kind of hilarious horror? <br /> <br />
