In 1934, Shirley Temple played three great movies and really began to make themselves known. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the audience liked best here. Two of these things were singing and dancing. Another film was an interesting short film that caught people's attention and made them forget depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's blockbuster movies. <br /> <br /> This film did not get anything of it, despite the stars of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite the very good director of Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many parties spoken here that simply become boring, and too many arguments between a sulky Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you did not have the normal good end, that's what the audience wants. I guess they learned after this movie.
