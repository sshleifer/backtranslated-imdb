When I go to see a movie about zombies, I do not expect Oscar-winning performances or writing at The Godfather, but I expect the actors to at least not look like theirs. efforts to read their memory cards and to dialogue it does not seem to have been typed 10 minutes before the actor reads it in front of the camera. This movie was really horrible. In fact, I got up and left about 25 minutes. I went to the side and I looked at Cold Creek Manor, it was not very good either, but Citizen Kane looked like this pile of shit. On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat longer than the first 5 minutes. In fact, I left after the murder of the hottest girl, there was nothing that could hold my interest. after that.
