Hello. My name is Paul Raddick, I am a panic striker from WTAF, Channel 29, in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this awful film that fueled Adam Sandler's career but was digitized shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard tells the story of an aspiring comedian played by Sandler, who works for a cruise ship. and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets babies who love World History, Part One and Rebound. The girls were supposed to be betrothed, but in reality they are executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler misbehaved in Going Overboard, but better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Dude, Drew Barrymore was a hot girl. The spanglish is red, Goole Overboard is not the squat of Dooley! End of file.
