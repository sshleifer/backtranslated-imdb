Del - "You are the most stupid person I know." <br /> <br /> Calvin - "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it during rewrites." <br /> <I think what I find the most blatant about this bastardization of Asimov's work is the way Susan Calvin's character was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to think about her problem. She's just a damsel in distress, waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> References to the laws of Asimov's robotics are numerous, but it is a reflection posterior to the CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is friendly, as in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not so good. You understand it well before these geniuses.
