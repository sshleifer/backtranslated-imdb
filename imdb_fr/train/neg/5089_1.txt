It is so sad that the Romanian public is still populated by vulgar and uneducated people who love this kind of showcasing demonstrations and inexpensive, as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or children's games "Vacanta mare "... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-craftsmen never claim to claim their art shows. Pintilie, who made a very good film 40 years ago ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by another, quite nice ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his "works of art" of feature film - but unfortunately, he masters at a too limited level, means of expression specifically cinematographic. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample of "HOW NOT" - this only concerns her merit.
