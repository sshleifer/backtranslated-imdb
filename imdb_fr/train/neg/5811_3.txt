I have not seen this movie for ages, but I thought I was going to comment, especially because the memory of having ignored it so intensely is engraved in my memory cells. THE original GETAWAY was not a prize to start with, but it had at least the distinction of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) was a relatively easy way to blow an hour and a half time. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the 1994 version is little more than a bit of vanity for Alec Baldwin, then very keen, and for his wife, Kim Basinger, who will soon be divorced. McQueen and his then wife, Allie McBride, also separated shortly after the creation of their film. In a way, we can imagine the Baldwins talking with their marriage counselor and wondering who is stupid to want to make this film. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that Alec Baldwin has never been and will never be close to the King Cooler, and one of the reasons this remake had so upset me was the perceived arrogance on the part of from Baldwin challenging our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. As someone pointed out, the vision of the 1972 film Peckinpah was a satire intended to parody the action / adventure genre heist. On the other hand, Baldwin and Bassinger seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, only the unspeakable and unscrupulous villains of Michael Madsen and James Woods posing as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also decidedly naughty. fiery and inconceivable at a fundamental level difficult to describe. One viewing was more than enough, not only because it had nothing new to offer, but because it had been done with naivety. Peckinpah's film was actually a small, upbeat entertainment with an upbeat atmosphere, where this version is a tedious job that takes too long to represent little or nothing. Its existence has no artistic urgency and some of the most uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to appreciate. <br /> <br /> I do not know so, it was probably one of the movies that helped initiate the wave of useless, artistically insipid big-budget reworking around a brand-name actor / actress then fame, which in itself is not a very good thing. I would always prefer to see a filmmaker at least try to find a new film idea and fall flat with something original. This film has just made me want to tear my eyebrows and it is telling that in the 15 years since its launch, Mr. Baldwin has become widely recognized as one of the biggest hustlers in Hollywood. Thank God for "Team America" ​​for putting it in its place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
