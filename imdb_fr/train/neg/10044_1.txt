This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what director did to create such a disaster. The songs were added without situations, the story was stretched to fill the gap of 3 hours and the most disgusting cases are the cascades of action performed by the actors, it is as if everyone had super powers that they could use between bullets, fire and nothing and a person who fights with 100 people. Anil Kapoor is the best performance. He still plays the villain with a comic band that speaks Hinglish ... Akki also does a good job ... But the filmmaker forgets it.
