What really makes me aware of this movie (that is, what makes me physically sick) is that someone really paid to make it work. The existence of this film makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary, it does not cause thoughts, it's not entertaining, it's not good. It's a cyanide sleeping pill. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and some other decent films, making the director's despair blatant. This is unlike any other movie ever made; it's much worse. Affirmations of an "extremely shocking end you will never forget" equate to a ton of stinking horse poop. Please, never waste your time looking at this bin, as this could make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should be removed from the list of Writer's Guild members and never be allowed to film again. Because if he thought that CELA was a movie worthy of being realized, he probably would not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have pity on the souls of all those who have the misfortune to see him. I'm going to throw up now.
