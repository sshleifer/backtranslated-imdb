A rather poor clone of Firestarter that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. What a disappointment on the part of Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Subcontractors are having a human experience with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born to the couple from the experience constantly has a fever of 100 degrees and when he is an adult, the people of his life start to burn spontaneously. He tries to understand why. <br /> <br /> People who burn are well cooked, but if they get to the point where they are well cooked, they are obviously transformed into mannequins. When fire throws from the arms of the characters, it seems rather silly to alarm as it should. Also ridiculous is the fire that obviously crosses the phone lines and emits huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. How is that supposed to happen exactly? <br /> <br /> Another element that seemed to me stupid about the movie is that a character has a vision of his deceased parent. We will see later exactly the same images of these visions in the movies at home.
