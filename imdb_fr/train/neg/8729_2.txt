It's a thriller with a good concept, a good acting, a good photo and good intentions all around, but confused and disjointed in the execution. <br /> <br /> Garcia plays the role of John Berlin, a Los Angeles forensic inspector who has moved. in a small Californian town at the request of one of his friends. He is soon involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder that leads him to theorize the existence of a serial killer in whom no one believes anymore. The known victim is theoretically blind, which leads to a romantic relationship with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite a fundamentally intriguing story, there were too many quantum jumps and intrigues in this film where I wondered: how the hell are we finishing here? or 'how did we discover that?' I found it confusing and disjointed, despite acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small role towards the end as F.B.I. Investigator looking for Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
