I really hated this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are immature, selfish and egocentric. They hurt EVERYONE around them playing their idiotic game. The visual effects were good, but what good are they if there are no characters with whom you associate or a story that is interesting. Am I supposed to be happy when these two psycho-consumed people end up consuming their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought, "It's supposed to be the French # 1 smash?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> Regarding the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They deserve one and the other! <br /> <br />
