I watched the movie and was appalled to find that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience. The language would shame the loafers of the street. <br /> <br /> The plot; a father not forcing any of his sons to marry, seems far-fetched. <br /> <br /> The idea that a grandmother asks her grandson to get angry with an enemy would only attract the attention of the faint-hearted. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the whole movie to laugh, and laugh that I made of my stupidity to lose 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look. <br /> <br /> I hope this saves you time!
