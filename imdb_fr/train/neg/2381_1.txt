I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is something to do. I was expecting something better from Uma Thurman, which is why I first went through this experience. A terrible movie with only music as a redemptive quality. It's just too bad that we can not give 0 out of 10 in these magazines. This film deserves it.
