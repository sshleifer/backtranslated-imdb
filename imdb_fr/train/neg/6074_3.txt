What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with something like that. If you want to make a film involving baseball and showing baseball scenes, give at least one realistic aspect to the action. Why was the crowd still standing for no reason during games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene of the movie .... what was it? We are in some way led to believe that DeNiro found himself on the field in the uniform of a referee and that the game is played even in a torrential rain ... one of the worst scenes of all time in a movie athletic. 3 out of 10 stars.
