Two years ago at Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's first film, Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and his frequent collaborator) Jacob's, the best thief in the world. It's a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a middle-class New York neighborhood. The film is not without poignant moments. But sometimes, it's as if Kornbluth was working too hard to assert the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle and more important, we understand that, despite all these somewhat abominable cultural foundations and the antisocial behavior they can engender, these characters do not lack kindness and humanity. We can shrink from their language and living conditions, but we can not deny their intention. And in fact, their struggles to keep a family in such adversity have a certain nobility that most of us can hardly appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is obvious. <br /> <br /> That said, the best thief in the world suffers many painful defects (including the title). The characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the plot is barely noticeable. And for many, the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys imitating gangsta rap between scenes. To everyone's tastes: But I'm not questioning the potential realism of this phenomenon, but it hurts me to see five-year-olds playing and talking about sex with a line of women. It is a value of useless shock and an obligatory interest borrowed.
