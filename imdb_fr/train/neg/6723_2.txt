Charlotte's deadly beauty and deadly blows make the movie cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a stupid way that you wonder if that's the end they thought about this movie. I wish someone could say that there is an alternative end, but I'm afraid that is not the case. As for the rest of the CST, well, I would say they simply did not do very well; This film makes me think of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly, since she was the only one to steal the series throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
