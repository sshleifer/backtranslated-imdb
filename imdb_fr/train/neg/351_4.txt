1 st watched on 02/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many ridiculous twists. Despite the very talented cast, this movie is too predictable and just underestimates its audience. The audience who goes to the cinema is not stupid and I hope that I will not continue to fill some stars, despite their involvement. We think this film will talk about something that would be appropriate in the beginning for Connery's death sentence, but it turns out to be just a standard, designed for the public, at the end of the line. , never finish, thriller. We are trained in all idiot character changes, as described to us when necessary in the story, and we are ready for this matter to be resolved before the end. Yes, there is good acting here, especially Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psychosocial support role, but the story does not work almost from start to finish.
