Tom is listening to one of those radio shows of yesteryear, something kids from the 1950s to the present day watched on television. However, they did not watch television during the creation of this caricature, which allowed people to be entertained - from comedy to music to scary stories - on the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally trembles while listening to a story about the "ghost". He literally does everything the narrator says, like "erect hair, shivering chills slipping down his back, his heart beating wildly," and so on. Jerry, meanwhile, looks at Tom and makes fun of his dreadful. - cat antics. <br /> <br /> We then have a glimpse of what we will see for many years after this 194-year-old drawing in which Jerry does not torture Tom for any other reason than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, it's one thing, but when he's busy with his stuff and Jerry physically abuses him (and in this case mentally), I find it hard to find the "little guy" ". <br /> These early T & M efforts were also a minute longer than anything that followed. Sometimes this minute makes a difference. That's what happened here for a while. This could have been reduced to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches lasted too long. It's usual for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, their pace is much faster.
