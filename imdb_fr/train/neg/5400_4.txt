This is just below a full festival based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid journalists, one seasoned (Miguel Ferrer) and the other less accomplished (Julie Entwisle), are beginning to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) might be a vampire. Stranger than strange, this modern blood sucker does not go naturally to him, but he seeks his victims through a black Cessna. The gore becomes horrible as the film approaches its stupid finale. Do not forget that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit that it's a bit scary in the wee hours of the night.
