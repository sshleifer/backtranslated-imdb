I kept a family of three toddlers for one night and their mother gave me this to show for them, as they had just taken it to Wal-Mart earlier in the week. The three children became physically ill looking at him. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they had eaten or something they had all picked up at school, but actually it could have been that movie. Absolutely disgusting. How can anyone produce this caliber of garbage beyond me? Fortunately, I turned off the film when I noticed that the children were not reacting and acting strangely. For all parents, I urge you not to let young children watch this movie.
