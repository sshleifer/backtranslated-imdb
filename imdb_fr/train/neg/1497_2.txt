Understand that I am reviewing the movie I saw. I realize practically all the nudity and the gore of this film, thus sterilizing it completely. Seeing names such as Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson tied, I knew I was not going to get a horror classic, but I was expecting at least free lunatics and a bloodbath. But no, it must be the most horrified modern horror film. I mean, it's easy to say that there are many more things in certain scenes, "but they're cut off, or the scene just ends as it begins. How can we screw up cannibals and pornstars? I mean, it's a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director has slept with the wife of a leader, or something like that, because it's literally amazing how much it's been chopped off. Reading this a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it sounded like a funny movie, but unfortunately, the real movie is locked somewhere in a safe and we have to endure this piece of excrement renamed Evil Breed . Hopefully an unrated version will be released someday, because I think a good movie exists in this mess, but until then, it's better to take a Twelve Pack of Bud, because that's the only way to succeed through this film.
