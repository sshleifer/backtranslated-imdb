This movie has no plot, no character development and no budget. it sucks to say it in brief terms. Since there is no development for the film, it can not really be considered an artistic attempt or an affirmation against torture. This leaves two other reasons to look at it eventually. Be shocked or go down like a sick little monster. Well, it's not enough here too. The girl's reactions just seem stupid. It's extremely easy to say that it's a fake (honestly, professional wrestling looks more realistic than the shit they're trying to cope with in this movie.) They throw her inserts, but she sleeps most of time, so it's a bit silly.The most useful part is the end when they move quickly from one scene to another just before the needle loses its eye.But honestly, the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly wrong, except for the eye If you want a good If you watch a movie about torture, check out Hostel and Hostel 2. They both contain realistic violence, but there are also a scenario that draws you in and concerns you with people, and the towing movies really work at a deeper level in terms of themes like American fears about foreigners, issues of morality, the fact to test how far a person t go, human instincts with respect to civilization, etc. are also written with care and contain good humor when the story is not centered on violence. These are much better choices than this piece of shit
