Is it a coincidence that Orca was manufactured two years after Jaws? Orca is not really a "scam", but it is obvious that she has tried to take advantage of the success of Jaws. First of all, Orca was, in my opinion, a bad movie, not terrible but certainly not good, average at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing his mate and unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I could not stand watching this movie again. The staging of this film is mediocre and, compared to Jaws, the director, producers and writers were almost devoid of talent. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, it was very average and credible, but the current characters are not the least friendly. The effects were acceptable for the time and images of the killer whale seemed pretty good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody and discouraged to more sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, drowning the sound effects and irritating at times. I hated the way they exaggerated the killer whale's intelligence (killer whales do not marry a single mate, as Orca describes it). <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad / bad in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I will not criticize this film and I can understand why some people may like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for its concept possibly a 5/10)
