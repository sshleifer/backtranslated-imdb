Me too, I got caught by the packaging. I, too, fell in love with the bloody packaging and DVD case that claims "afflicted fans, each copy being out of the shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not worth it - no panic and a very limited gore. The end was very old and did not give the punch she should have had. I do not really know how it became a "naughty video" with how much he is tamed. The story lags, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it does not keep the promise. The bonus feature DVD ("the interview") is very strange because the director seems very inconsistent and not quite there. The lead actress speaks as if she appeared in a Shakespearian production. It's a very good laugh.
