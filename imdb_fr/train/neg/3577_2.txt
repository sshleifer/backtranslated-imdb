This Pia Zadora's first vehicle followed a familiar formula by Harold Robbins: an ambitious main character wallowing in decadence while continuing his journey to the top of a world chosen at random but glamorous, in this case the film industry . But although it is so formulated as to be completely predictable, this film manages at the same time to be completely incredible. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. One would expect a film about making a film to have a glimpse of its own sector and creative process. But the screenplay does not give him any of the qualities that make writers interesting in film characters: observance, skill with words, love-hate relationship with his own creative abilities. His character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence displayed here. Cinematography is so murky that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. And as the scenes are never really assembled, everything seems to be a succession of random moments during bad Hollywood parties. To avoid.
