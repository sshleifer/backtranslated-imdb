This movie was heavily tainted by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how I should say Steven So-Dull! As before, Seagal is too good or too stupid to redouble his own lines, letting someone imitate his voice for shots where the sound should be looped. A few movies before, he did it too, but I do not think of that measure! To be honest, the movie looks good, the script might need some work, but some parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all in all, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been better without Seagal, which has become a cartoon of itself. Do not bother yourself. All that exceeds the money for this one is too much! Honestly, I think it's the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What took me so long to realize that ?!
