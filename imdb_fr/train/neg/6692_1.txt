During a sleepless night, I changed channels and found this embarrassment of film. What did they think? <br /> <br /> If it's life after Kari (Wuhrer) Salin's "Remote Control", it's no wonder she's gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this role? It is pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I shot the movie towards the end, so I did not have much of the plot. But that must have been the best part. This nerdy college boy brings home this dominatrix ... this scene is straight out of comics - or cheap porn movies. She calls the anal retentive mother and kisses the father "Oh, I was not expecting a tongue!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> After that, I had to see how it ended .. <br /> <br /> Of course, this hellhole has a helluva past, the SWAT team is at the top . And yes ... they surround him! And yes, yes! The kid is blowing his brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is the television not to be missed. <br /> <br />
