This is an amateur film filmed on video, not an "electrifying drama" as the fake DVDs claim. I have seen many better things from undergraduate students in cinema. Most of the story takes place during a full night taxi ride around Jakarta. This film could have been made with a single video camera, but there are some sections in which two cameras were used and the content was then sent back together. Editing is extremely difficult. The final editing was probably done with two cameras, returning content backwards, instead of an appropriate editor. Maybe they also did the editing in the taxi? English subtitles were written by someone who does not speak English, for example, "Where you go now?" Saying that the quality of production is at the same level as Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative venture, with lots of cool and funky pictures from around Jakarta.
