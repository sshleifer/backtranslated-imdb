One time, I promised never to come out of a movie (personal politics that made me suffer through different types of stuff, such as Rambo 3, Fuck Me, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl was almost successful. Hundstage was a really horrible experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are a group of retarded miserable and pathetic. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humble for each other only for one reason - distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them seem to come straight from the imagination of Austrian shock cartoonist Deix), director Seidl wants us to believe that it's real life in the world. Austrian suburbs (European? Western?). The viewer is confronted with representations of sexual orgies, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not a social criticism. This is just a pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, bad cinematography, poor performance. If someone needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong with our society, then that person must have gone through life with their eyes closed. It is a pseudo-social critique with a mass. And he despises people disgustingly and condescendingly. It shows ugly people - that's not the reason I hate it. But he portrays the average people in an ugly and misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is so despicable.
