The tenuous link between this film and the first Grease is established at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn, one of the four members of the cast who repeats their role, approaches the young Maxwell Caulfield, a British student participating in an exchange . Although, in the previous film, Olivia Newton St. John did not explain the structure of her speech in a foreign language, she explained it here. Caulfield is his cousin. What Conn is still doing at school, I guess she just likes to hang around in Rydell High even though she's a beautician right now. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a clever kid, so of course, the hood types headed by Adrian Zmed labeled him A Geek. And that's a pity when Zmed's girlfriend decides that she loves Caulfield. But being a nerd just will not cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to play a modern role in Zorro. He picks up a bike and learns to learn to drive. He gets a leather biker outfit with glasses to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will have no problem making friends in gay leather bars as he is equipped. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and pitched them on successful career paths both enjoyed. If you've seen the first movie Grease, a much better movie, then you definitely have an idea of ​​how this movie looks. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all of the faculty members of the original Grease are returning to their roles. The score is not as good as the songs of the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not great.
