THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most oversized, extreme and complete mess I have ever seen coming out of France. There is nothing worse than a French production that is trying to outdo the films shot in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of this horror / action / boyfriend movie. I almost stopped him midway because I knew it would be nothing but French trying to show himself. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a promising way, like a sort of expansive horror movie, but quickly shifts genres, from horror to action, to the x-file type or movie boyfriend, that in the end, CR is everything and nothing else. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought it was all comedy. The painful dialogue and these silent pauses, with fainting and fainting just at the right moment of exposure, made me moan. I thought that only movies shot in Hollywood used this disordered technique. <br /> <br /> The pursuit scene, where Vincent Cassel runs after the murderer, is so over-directed and over-done that it's almost a beautiful thing. The climax at the top of the mountain, with the silly revelation about the murderer (s) with Cassel and Reno playing "peeps" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely derailed the credibility of the film at that time. <br /> <It is hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS has also directed GOTHIKA, which has had its share of problems, is not even close to the gravity of this film too confused and confused.
