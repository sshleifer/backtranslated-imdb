This movie is the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There does not seem to be a plot, but you realize that it goes well beyond the beginning of the film, so you have to look at the closure for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director, aka the laziness that plays the stamp in the film, and we do not believe that Willem Dafoe in this movie, he is a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know since "apocalypse now" and "the benefactors of the dock", n would have never accepted such a scenario. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) foe wrote this bill at the same time as his baby under twenty. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, then two writers, Dafoe and Colagrande, and the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the story); The widow meets the guy, the guy strikes the widow, the widow smashes the windshield with the guy who hit her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; The black widow (different title, same bullshit). <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! It's a total lapse of time !!!
