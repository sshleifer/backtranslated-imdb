"Piece is Cake" is a defeatist and revisionist story of the worst kind, whose sole purpose is to falsely offend the reputation of the (admittedly fictitious) pilots it represents. This left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> In "The Monthly Plane" of March 1989, Roland Beamont sentenced scathing the behavior of the RAF Fighter Command in the television mini-series. Some of his comments deserve to be repeated: <br /> <br /> "There was no feeling of defeatism in the squadrons I saw in action, and a total absence of the madness described in 'Piece of Cake'. That would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The atmosphere that prevailed was closer to that of a good rugby club, but with more discipline. There was no sense of "death or glory" either. RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and we are now required to do so - no more and no less. <br /> <br /> "There was no talk of" courage "or" cowardice. "People had guts or not - but mostly they had them, but we knew the fear, the recognition in us and ourselves, doing our damnation to control it, then continuing our work ... <br /> <br /> "..., but there was a feeling of greatness and none of that looked like to "a piece of cake". "<br /> <br /> Beamont was, in his own words," a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent television series, was there at the time ". <br /> < Beamont served with 87 Squadron in France and BoB, before becoming a key Typhoon and Tempest representative and a post-war test pilot. <br /> <br /> "A piece of cake" is a totally false representation of how the Fighter Command pilots acted at the time.This is nothing less than a complete and complete shame ...
