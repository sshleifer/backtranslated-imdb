Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and thus invests in a club and the contracts that accompany it. <br /> <br /> This movie was .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and I immediately realized that everything would go wrong .. But after rejecting movies in the past and found they were excellent (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). ..I gave a shot and it failed in the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The scenario is something that a teenager could find if he had five minutes to go prepare ... He was weak, with weaker dialogue. There seems to be an immediate need for romance in a gangster movie. So Brigante decides to hit a guy for the girl ... and she says "Yes!" And if you need to act mean, just throw racism around ... As we learn from the "Italian gangsters" ... <br /> <br /> The acting game was terrible, It's the least I can say ... I've found "Hollywood Nicky", hilarious. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hate all those musicians who go to the movies. , the only reason that P Diddy shot this movie was to be able to play the role of a gangster.The sex scene was weak but we could see it ... which suited ... <br /> <br /> > But overall, I was expecting it to clarify how Carito ended up in jail and the love of his life ... And the killer towards the end completely added to the dreadful movie that lies ... <br /> <br /> Carlito's Way: the rise.
