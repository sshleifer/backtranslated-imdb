Two old men sitting on a park bench. I do not really have a problem with this scene - The only problem is that it's not a scene, it's all the film <br /> <br /> Yup movies do not have more low concept. Moreover, they do not get any more boring than that either, but there is worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, Yiddish Communist, the other is Midge Carter, a former gold glove champion, also black. Let's see a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along well. Well, I guess it's possible, although unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why follow the Jewish stereotype? Why make them boasters of the populace tribilist who take oath in Hebrew? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the beginning of the film are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s It is written for a totally different media of the cinema, it is based on a play and it is sees. Walter Matthau waits through his role as Nat while this commentator has almost slept throughout the film
