One scene shows quite well the "Terminator Woman" mentality: Karen Sheperd and another woman try to escape the villain's camp. Karen meets an armed guard, who throws her weapon at her, but after a few seconds, he throws and defies her. Karen kicks him in the balls, takes the gun and runs away! Again, when a movie is made by a martial artist and written / produced by another family member, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble start having fun, and the movie might have been better if it focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes, they are separated and the film is slowed down. Even with an occasional fight scene to enliven things, it lacks excitement. In the final, Trimble fights Qissi in a cave and Sheperd will fight against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are interconnected so as to break their flow and decrease their value. On the positive side, congratulations to the costumes department for giving Karen the chance to show a spectacular split throughout the film! (* 1/2)
