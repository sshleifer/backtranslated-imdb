The 1990s began to have daytime talk shows pushing left and right. Each network had one, and they all lacked one thing, originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese mother of the trailer park with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while she was nursing one of her dozens of illiterate, toothless children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity have been ruined by this story. Titles ranging from Girl to Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to look at this pure and pure trash? Has our society really become nothing more than a group of fathers on Billy's Hill and those who lost their lives? The people who participated in this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. TRASH is any reader who wants this show to be rebroadcast or put on DVD. People are wondering why Americans are becoming huge piles of lard and are too big to have a job. It is as if such shows are telling them that it is acceptable to have 500 overweight books and that 12-year-old girls behave like prostitutes. Having such garbage on television ruined morality.
