I came across this film on a rainy Sunday, in order to tune in to something else. Out of curiosity, I looked at the comments here and found myself watching them all the way. I really did not do it intentionally - it was one of those movies where you're "fascinated" and watch it "a few minutes", until you finally see it through. And the indictment in most of these comments made it more fascinating to see. The comment that really pleased the person seems to be due solely to his taste for Ladd and Spano and their previous roles. But there is no such thing here, it does not exist anywhere else - history, performance, and in particular the absurd absurd courtroom. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-pound mark) and Ben Matlock have some leeway to walk around the courtroom, instead of being bored by a lectern . And Matlock has the privilege of presenting exhibits, often by simply appearing before a jury and showing them, even before the judge and prosecutor have been informed or shown. No real-life judge or prosecutor would be in favor of this decision. <br /> <br /> Perry and Ben almost always ended the procedure by writing the true murderer's confession. In fact, Perry was almost always doing this, but often Matlock simply presented overwhelming evidence of the real culprit, pronounced it "reasonable doubt", and then allowed the cops and prosecutors to pursue the culprit - sometimes on camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But having said that, Holland Taylor's hype and the room for maneuvering allowed him to make Matlock / Mason's actions look more like those in the room. hearing. Slow and often boring details, such as those seen on Court TV and in real court rooms. <br /> <br /> Each character in this presentation was either tasteless, unfriendly, obnoxious, boring, improbable - or a combination of two or more <br /> <br /> The conclusion was the most banal, the most absurd , even the stupidest possible conclusion - but again, fascinating for this reason. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals and t.v. the movies would seem their best asset - probably the best in role role (probably better if "3rd"), even in this place. Taylor could be considered the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story / performance, and 3 others for the Fascination Factor.
