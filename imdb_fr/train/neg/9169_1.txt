It's getting really bad. The effects of the thousands of balls used during the film are the only quality that buys halfway. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, save Kirk. The story is as disturbing as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself kills the film, if it was not already a corpse. So all in all, it's a waste of your life. I would have given a zero if it had been an option on the rating scale.
