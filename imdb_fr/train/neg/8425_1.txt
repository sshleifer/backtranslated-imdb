Really a disgusting and vile movie, with only a small amount of real humor. <br /> <br /> The character of the father in particular is vulgar to the extreme (intentionally, obviously) and described in the most pathetic way, In a shady way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film horribly disturbing, with no redeeming features. Frankly, I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort a sick and rude embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Those who loved this film have a capacity that I miss completely: that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and misery. <br /> <br /> Producers must be ashamed of themselves.
