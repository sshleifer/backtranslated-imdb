I can not believe I just spent an hour and a half watching such a weak movie. If you miss only one film, it is this one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently. He begins to socialize with anti-social adolescents in the area and to use drugs. All this makes him unconsciously more violent and in the end, such a subconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing to do is that I do not think I can find meaning or trace of ecstasy in this movie, not a single character. If the director considers what I saw in the last minutes as a great ecstasy, I must say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature either. Most of the time, I did not see the facial expressions of the actors and I did not think that the body language was enough to have an impact. The crew may have been so tired that it repaired the camera to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the public. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and discussions that could be supposed to be related, but they are so random that you can never get them together, maybe unless you are the one who wrote them. During the first hour and a half, you can find less than 5 minutes of real play and at all times, there are only people who walk, talk and move. So, I really can not comment on the cast of actors here. <br /> <br /> But good choice of music these last minutes. This may be the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave a 1 to a movie, but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch horror movies). It's a film about when a failed attempt to represent troubled teens meets an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you are not part of any group.
