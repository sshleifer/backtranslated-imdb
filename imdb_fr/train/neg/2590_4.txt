American Pie moved away from the first. At first, I think the actors have no idea what they're doing and it's more of a remake of a ramshackle college party. The story describes two young freshmen (featuring the sultry youngster) who dream of going to college just to experience late-night parties, sex and of course alcohol. The plot is stupid and goes well away from the original pie. In fact, they have not yet presented an apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and I can rent for free. But remember, it's a waste of time if you do not like brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and alcoholism. I am a teenager myself and I think even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice instead.
