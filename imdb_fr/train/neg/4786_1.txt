I despise horror movies, it's no secret. No conspiracy, bad acting and gallons of blood are just staples of these movie mistakes, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable channels actually manage this waste. (This trash is straight out in the video, if I remember correctly.) Like any other movie would be a great insult to this other movie, I say this: All Phantasm movies, all movies Jason, Freddy, Chucky movies and most of Michael Myers' films can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
