If you've always wanted to see a film that focuses on style rather than substance, it's for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there is little precious substance, unless son of love maudic, melodramatic and manipulative do not excite you. It may be one of those famous "girls' movies" you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We are halfway to this film before anything happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea looking for tuna and does not come back, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and her son fend for themselves. Then, after six minutes of furious screens, they bury Ulises, Martina remarries and her son grows up in the middle of his childhood. This rapid transposition is discordant and very sloppy: after 40 minutes of suspensions more or less trailing, we are suddenly caught in a melodrama in itself, all in six minutes. I think it's called a capricious narrative. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (as in the wandering superhero Ulysses, understood?), returns to her 'Penelope' (Watling) to find that she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez) , an inexplicably rich guy (what does he do to win all this dough?) who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, very angry, questions Ulises about his absence, he tells her that he will take her one day to Sumatra Island and that she will understand EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: DO NOT Take her to the island of Sumatra. The reference just dies somewhere in the script. He does not really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He does not perform like an honorable man, and the film DOES NOT FILL the holes of the plot that are watching us for at least half of the movie. I can only assume that the director Bigas Luna wants us to complete the story with the mystical clues (fish, reptiles, sea) that he offers through breathtaking cinematography and an evasive dialogue. It does not work. The narrative arc of this film has the advantage of resembling a wobbly clothesline. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just could not buy his Ulises as a hero. (That's what the original Ulysses was supposed to be). With a moist sensuality, he throws a short stanza of Virgil's identical poetry about 2,000 times and each time she excites Martina to an explosive orgasm. This guy should be hired to revive obsolete marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. I do not understand it very often. <br /> <br /> This poetic "device" occupies a prominent place in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was a kind of reversal of the famous "song" Ulysses' "siren" (ie beautiful young ladies singing seductively too far away condemned sailors if they answered the call of the siren). If this is the goal of Bigas Luna, you can see the problem: it offers a complicated symbolism in an attempt to pull off High Art. Again, it just does not work, at least for me. <br /> <br /> Watling is a young and beautiful magnetic actress, but she gives us here a character who does not seem to have much romantic depth. I do not understand how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who has a sign to rent on her face (as if she were vacant), greasy hair like the 1960s that looks more like algae and one of these trendy beards of the 21st century '(You know, four days of growth, no more, no less). He is supposed to be a dreamer (I think), but his eyes suggest he might suffer more from overexposure to an absurd scenario. <br /> <br /> But do not despair, it's good to watch this movie. Just do not try to connect the dots on red herring or think too much about what you mean as a dialogue. You can make a quick advance on this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you will not miss much.
