I thought maybe a movie with a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Absolutely absurd pretentious from start to finish with O'Toole and York struggling wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what was going on. I have the impression that O'Toole plays the role of a Scottish castle castle with a drinking problem and relives childhood games with his sister (York). He also barks mad. But aside from that, your hypothesis is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The film has no functionality that redeems anything. I can only assume that the actors and the director were blackmailed in order to make this stupid, unimaginative and stupid monster. Clearly a waste of time of a casting and a talented director. Laughable.
