It's one of those movies where you and a bunch of friends are sitting around drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me, I found myself watching this one alone. My friends and I rented a big block of movies and never had time to see this one. It was due back and I thought it was a waste not to look at it. That's what I did, and I was impressed by the seriousness of this film. <br /> <br /> Now, I really like bad movies, and I probably would have liked this one if the "hero" was not so disgusting. All the movie, I was hoping he would put this stupid sword and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic things in the movie. It's a big stuff, disgusting and stupid. He has less redemption than the bad guys. And what was it with all the naked girls? I mean, I like naked girls just as much as other guys, but this movie was a little too expensive in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, if you like bad movies and can stand a disgusting "hero" "then I'm sure you'll like this movie story.
