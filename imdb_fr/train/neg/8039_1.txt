This silly movie is a piece of shit and boring like the rehearsals of the complete house. For anyone who wants to see an awesome horror movie, exciting and cool, should not even think about watching this stupid workgroup. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad game 5) wrong direction and finally a bad script. I mean I'm not like grumbling about every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This film should be banned in a box, locked and sunk in the sea. So please, do not remake anything like this, please, please, please !!! !
