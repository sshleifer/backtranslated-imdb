It's a horrible little movie - and unfortunately, the company that made this short film made several more. The short film is basically an idea of ​​a joke that was not funny at first and could also offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most of them about 2 years old) gamboling and masquerading as adults - in this case, a dancehall girl bar. This is the kind of humor that your own kids might be forced to laugh at if they claim to be adults, but I do not see anyone who wanted to see that - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather tight way. held and acts like a vamp !! And then, other children behave like adults in some rather adult situations. At the time, I'm sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles, but when we look at them today, that's what immediately comes to mind! Because of this, this boring movie also scared me and I hope I never see him again !! Quite strange and quite awful.
