Of course, we all love bad movies at one time or another, and we really appreciate them. It was not a guilty pleasure, it was just shit. A guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make him the main character when he probably got drunk - probably both - and thought it was a good idea to make a movie. He then showed his scenario to equally strong / drunk people. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal that I could not go past 20 minutes before turning it off. That makes you served looks like citizen Kane. Batman? WTF ... a guy who walks with a bat, really original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit.
