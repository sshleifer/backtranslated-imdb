I could not wait to see this movie. About halfway through the movie, I could not wait for it to end. All (white) actors were delivering their lines as Woody Allen had just said, "Say it like that ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks, and he does not fall on his words like Mr. Allen. The humorous part of this movie was as boring as the tragedy and was never funny or entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of Woody Allen and this film certainly did not convert me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This film will be one of the 10 worst films of my life.
