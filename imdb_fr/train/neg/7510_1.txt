The film is a collection of snapshots on just about everything. It has no objective, no objective, no real message. Symbolism is pushed to the extreme and stereotypes are abundant and scandalous. This film can not resist the temptation to play drama where it does not exist. Each small exchange of words is immediately transformed into a long and unjustified dialogue, typical of an acting rehearsal. When there is no substance to this exchange, the actors (regardless of their normal quality) can not help but compensate by an exaggerated emotion, in other words "to raise the stakes". More than acting, to put it simply. The staging is of no help here. Nothing can save this non-story. He is forced, rigged and boring to tears. Inaccurate punk rock music with The Who, piercings and flashy outfits from the 90s. The characters roam without role, without detail and without motive. The locations are arbitrary. Here Boogie Nights with The Good Fellas and Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art torn. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it to him. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This film is Lee's fault. He sold, like the rest of them. Become irrelevant. He has no more interest in saying. <br /> <br /> I have no longer any desire to see this guy again (that I will not talk about all this later).
