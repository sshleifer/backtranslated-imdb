One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is to rely on a well-known classic scenario to make it a real bastard. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the persistent plot of the Phantom of the opera and installs it in a shopping center of the late 80s. However, the goal of the "Phantom" is now simply to take revenge on those responsible for the disfigurement of his face and murder of his family. Special effects provide a good laugh, especially when body parts start to appear in the yogurt kiosk dishes. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as completely odious as one would expect, especially because his fifteen minutes of MTV glory had not yet arrived. If you're looking for some fun laughs at the actors and the special effects team, take a look at this video. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
