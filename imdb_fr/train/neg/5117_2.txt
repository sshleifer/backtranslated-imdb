I first want to say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry). I understand what it means to work on a feature film to be a support for filmmakers in this regard. I am all for positive and uplifting messages if they are faithful to the nature of life (that it is a fallen world and things are not always settled, even for the followers of Christ). I am happy that others have extremely positive reactions to the declared Christian message; for me, it's just that the execution is the one where the film fell on the figure. A film lives and dies in its history and you have here dimensional stereotypes, an abundance of exposures and spontaneous changes in the behavior of characters that are inexplicable to say the least. I think that a movie does not have to break your head with its message to get the message across. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. will improve over time and their storytelling methods will also improve. Maybe they could lead someone else's script for their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you are interested in an inspiring PG rated movie, look at Steven Soderbergh's Hill King. All truth is the truth of God ...
