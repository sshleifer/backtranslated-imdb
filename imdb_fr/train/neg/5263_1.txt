This is without a doubt the worst movie I can remember watching. Everything was incredibly clich√© and delayed. The game was horrible too. The camera work was not bad but it still could not buy it back. The screenwriter / director of this film must suffer from Down syndrome if he thinks that this film will help him in his career. I want to find the hour and a half of my life that I lost watching this shit. I would rather watch a video of the grass that grows than this one. I can not believe IMDb forces me to write 10 lines to post this, but I think this movie is so bad that I have to keep telling others. The reason I came here was that my girlfriend asked her at the local library, thinking it was Kris Kristoferson's movie that was finally called "Disappearances". I do not know who is responsible for this garbage that ends up in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, my pain and my suffering. In conclusion, the director / scriptwriter of this film has more hope to recognize him in the street.
