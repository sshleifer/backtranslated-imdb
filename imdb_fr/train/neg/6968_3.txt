An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be fading. He gets bitten or bitten by something on it. He quickly falls ill and the hospital spits a large, twisted white larva. A subsequent attempt to resuscitate him with paddles causes blood splatter. <br /> <br /> A police officer is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured during a shooting. In a way, the policeman is paired with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought. Several young children wander in the hospital, which I suppose we are supposed to find adorable, but that is extremely boring. brats. They wander into the room where the specimen is kept and spill a growth hormone on it.

People are running away, and sometimes to her for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by armies willing to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the movie, and most of the time, it seems like people are looking for the monster.
