Ok, what kind of TRASH have I seen now? "The Mountain of the Witches" must be one of the most incoherent and senseless Spanish exploitation films of all time and yet, at the same time, it is strangely convincing. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I doubt even that there was ever a script with which to work, but somehow I could not disable it. The confusion begins right away with the confusion, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. So you think this film revolves around the children possessed by the forces of evil? Damn no, because after this intro, the girl and her wickedness are simply not mentioned anymore. Then cut yourself to a guy with the cutest mustache you've ever seen, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather subtle way. When she asks him to spend his holidays with her, he quickly calls his employer to ask him any type of mission! Big move. The film finally begins now, as he travels to a remote mountainous region to photograph peaks. But not until he takes a new girl (Patty Shepard) and topless photography! Throughout their journey, all kinds of strange events occur ?? did you guess? are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, petrifying music is broadcast everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, witch car? Apparently, a group of silent witches own the mountains and practice voodoo on intruders. It is as close as I describe the plot, but there is a good chance that I am far ?? More importantly, it's the atmosphere! "The Mountain of Witches" is sometimes very scary, with its phantasmagorical music and interesting cinematography. The supporting characters all look strange and the lovely Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured script.
