It is important not to be insulted by a lack of logic or common sense and those with "gray questions" will agree that this film just does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems are in the direction, cast selections and lack of depth in the construction of the character. The word comedy was a very hard thing to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister in their mid-thirties seem to be well adjusted. They meet a stranger in a park and the character of Heather Graham joins her to ask her the most intimate questions: a person, even half sane, ran the other way or shouted at least for a policeman. He then walks awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and falls in love with him. Then after an appointment where they all went out together, he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week ???? Hello, does anyone still feel stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this person who says about 10 words WE see on the screen and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it made no sense. Of course it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the direction has made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather falls head over heels with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (superficial character) kiss or more in focus, it's the most neglected kiss of all time that chemistry CAN be present. I found it unemotional and not very funny and although many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality is that Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was the beginning of Sue Kramer as a director and it was too much for her. It would take a lot of talent for this film to work and in my humble opinion, it could be done with better writers, actors and directors.
