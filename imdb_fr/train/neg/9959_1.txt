Cheap and manipulative. This film has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also contains a dreadful dialogue, unconvincing characters and an absurd or rather non-existent story. This only gets worse in a cynical effort to snatch some kind of emotion from a crazy hysteresis! <br /> <br /> And the HERISH !!! The hedgehog, by the way, gave the most compelling and most watchable performance of this ninety-minute film. <br /> <br /> If you have considered watching this movie, do not do it. I'm sorry but I can not find a single feature to buy this movie. He scores a fat ZERO fat with me. Strictly for sub-Dogma Knicker-Wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Yet, if you like Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
