I almost called HBO and asked for my money back for the month just because they were showing this movie. I can just watch the film directors stay seated: "Well, we have to come up with something that looks like Home Alone, only we're going to add a lot of money for the kid, hire discounted actors, and oh yeah, we're going to let's make it a lot less funny! "<br /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you have here. Not even worth seeing if someone else praises it. And like a movie for kids? Forget it. I would not let my children see him, not necessarily because of jokes of bad taste, but because I did not want them to say, "What are you thinking of showing us that lame trash bin, dad?!?!"
