Contains spoilers The plot of the film can be summed up in a few sentences: Three guys go hunting in the forest. Two of them and others are shot in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand aside, shout and do anything without being shot. He walks in an old factory and makes the evil people go straight ahead without struggle. The perpetrators are conveniently dressed in black and look like criminals. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story, not summarized but detailed. Everything is drawn with a guy who rings at the door. We are waiting with him. Long shot of guys bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The only shot from chasing a woman jogging could have been helpful if we could see her buttocks bounce back. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue below Terminator and it is not because there is a lot of action. The characters do not speak. And then, they do not even have anything cheesy to say, like: I'll come back. If my friend turned it on the weekend, I would encourage it, because it's quite a feat to understand the controls of the camera. Paying money to rent it as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> What's a bit funny is the little extra with the director, who explains how the local police did not realize she was shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. If they had filmed it, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch than the movie.
