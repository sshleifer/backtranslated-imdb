If I were asked how I would define the word "Shallow", I would answer "Look at a production by Jerry Bruckheimer". If I were asked how I would define the phrase "Potential wasted", I would answer "Look at a production by Jerry Bruckheimer". Bruckheimer's productions are almost always sure that the fire hits the box office but almost always receive critical criticism from critics. From memory, I can only think of ONE OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN who praise the criticism. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE has also been critically acclaimed, it's certainly one of Bruckheimer's best films that, alas, does not say much. The problem I had was the scenario that defines history: the Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict is spreading all over Russia, leading an ultra-nationalist Russian to seize a nuclear missile base and to threaten the West if they interfere. Maybe the end of the cold war had everything to do with it, but I found this configuration unconvincing. Some geographical errors, such as the French company Foch located in the Mediterranean (the Foch would not it be better placed in the Black Sea?), Or that the exhibition film consists of familiar sequences staging conflicts of the sea. Balkans, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Once again, the adjective "very unconvincing" slipped into my mind. The story improves somewhat when the story itself - a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - begins. Director Tony Scott does his best as the actors do, but the problem lies in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if it had been done in the mid-1980s, when World War III was a real possibility - that may not be the case - that movie would have terrified me, but after the end of the cold war, the dangers of nuclear war left it little impact.
