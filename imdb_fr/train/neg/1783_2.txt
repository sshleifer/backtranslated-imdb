The only good thing is some very good one-liners delivered very kindly by Alice Krige, but again she is Alice Krige. His soft, dreamy voice hints at how dangerous these strange creatures can be. She is incredibly scary in this otherwise incredible plot. How they managed to make him accept this project remains a mystery. Scenario writers must have been processed when submitting this script. He has big continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formulas, and simply does not make sense.
