... but I saw better too. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable: a film crew tries to film a horror film at a place where murders were committed. Three guess what's going on. It's not a bomb in its own right - the cast is pretty good, the best players being John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine. It's pretty well done - for a low-budget movie. Do not expect scenes of nudity, swearing, blood or blood (the film has a very low protection factor). I have never been totally bored - I can watch on a calm night. I saw it on video - it was a HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Nevertheless, I did not hate him and his end is cool, which surprised me. Basically, nothing happens until then, it takes you off guard. To see, but only if you are a complete horror movie.
