It's a waistline to indulge in such big actors in such a weak and boring film. In addition to all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what is so difficult to capture the thieves? Just eliminate the bank employees, see who was at the bank - from all angles of the camera - before the thieves entered, and you have those 4 extra thieves among the hostages. Where is the suspense everyone is talking about? It was so obvious when the hostages were asked to put on the identical uniform that they would all go out through the front door ... several times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the film with good scores and artistic shots. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
