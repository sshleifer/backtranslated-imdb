The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what to think before thinking about it, has been realized. Is it a kind of miracle or sinister joke that people put on straight jackets as they see fit, twist into contoured shapes and smile like great apes? Films, art, no longer risk the unknown, but are lost conclusions, exhausted by life. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a bland story, worthy of a lecture on feminism in college. His lesson is schematic, right-angle and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, mistreated, then thrown in the trash by a society dominated by men." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, supposedly, was the "pin-up queen of the 1950s", the millions of men ejaculated ass. (All critics repeat this phrase, "queen of the 1950's pin-up", as a choir of monkeys.) Her story as an American sex bomb is well-known: Southern, raped by her father, raped, etc. In this film, she is a naive, innocent ignorant of the perverse interests she serves and of which she benefits shamelessly. Although she believes in Jesus, she loves to frolic naked in front of a camera lens - like the so-called fantasy sexual slave. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of the director and director Mary Harron herself, Educated at Oxford AND ex-punker (do you feel the allied decay of privilege and "hipness" as I do it?): "I feel that without feminism, I would not do it ... I do not do feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I think women have better films." comfortable. <br /> <br /> The film simply tells the story of a human life, its subject and its goal having been praised and buried well before the beginning of the film. Ms. Page has a boyfriend, but we are shown almost nothing about their relationship. In fact, there is no intimate or detailed relationship in the film. <br /> <br /> We can not ignore its simplicity. In New York, where Ms. Page does her best to integrate and soothe the world of men, tied up in the strings of bondage and tightly tied to S & M's black leather boots and corsages, the film is black and white. White. But in Miami, where she is going to escape, she takes off her clothes with joy and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> As if nothing had happened, Harron did nothing. "making feminist films", "does not do anything ideological". The ideology has become so internalized, supposed, programmed that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.
