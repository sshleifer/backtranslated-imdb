Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot in video and not in film. The story is complicated and the production is incredibly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the defending couple is in a plane that apparently lands in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their relationship at a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown entering an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, that would not last five minutes under the New England climate. On another plane trip, the photo shows a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably, they could only afford to travel in flight conditions. Regarding the plot, this film expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devoted Christian brother, is expelled from his church when the congregation learns that his brother is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally prepares Victor with a thief for killing Ben and Arthur "to purge their souls of sin". Apparently, no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Without Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film would have no redeeming quality.
