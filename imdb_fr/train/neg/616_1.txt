Let's face it; a lame kid who dies and his soul is transferred to a scarecrow. Will not happen neva! OMFG This stupid loser kid who can not defend himself gets shot by a bastard drunk fucking his mother. As he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and lets his mind enter the scarecrow. The drunk guy concealed his death by making her seem suicidal and thinking that he had escaped. We see later that he is thrown out of the trailer and later wins a new encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief meeting in which the drunkard calling him the loser and the scarecrow bouncing with "We must know one, loser!" The scarecrow leaves the building, calls it "papa-o", then decapses the poor man. We can see how this awesome movie unfolds. He then continues to kill many people. He mainly kills people who have made him go through difficult times and goes off to kill random donkeys, just to laugh. No laugh here. It also adds a hit line to each victim. Every time he kills someone, he does some karate flips and finishes with one of his kicking lines. In the case of a hearing impaired person, he would say "Here, take the corn EAR!" then push him in the ass. OR we can really take an example of the movie! He just finished killing a cop and was about to kill the only person who ever defended him. His father, the sheriff, shouted at the madman to stop, and he said "Hey, stay a while!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck it on a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw the hit line "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by thrusting a fake into their head. Wowzors, this movie made me want to put my pants in cream. Maybe the next time this guy does a movie, he will not be gay.
