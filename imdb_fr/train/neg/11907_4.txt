I understand that the character of Diehl is supposed to be a microcosm of America itself - to see Arab terrorists under every rock, only to discover in the end that it is his own actions that drag him along all the way. this seat and really practice goodwill towards all men, everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry, Wim, you made incredible movies in the past that remain neutral of politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and weaken this film well made, incredibly filmed with absurd characters, dialogues and plots. Better luck for your next movie. Another thing that rushed me was the fact that the homeless section of Los Angeles was there for reasons of hunger, these people do not eat enough. Really, these people do not eat in a regal way, but the real hunger is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-esteem, dignity that you can not give to a man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need it, they are available. The less the center for the fight against hunger in America, I would rather say the center for alcoholism, drug addiction, mental suffering and economic devastation. Fighting hunger, although it is a noble enterprise, helps to solve a more deeply rooted, societal and human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as a young soul (still cliched).
