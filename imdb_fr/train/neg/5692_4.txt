A disappointing action movie with an interesting premise: A young mobster (Chandler) must show his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to take lessons with a well-known murderer (Beluschi ). First and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), which is completely strange for all. But is she an easy target? The film continues again and again based on this main idea, but the result is simply a bad routine. even the strange twist at the end does not save the film. Good performance of Chandler. I give him a 4 (four).
