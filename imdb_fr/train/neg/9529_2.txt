In this cult film of 1977, two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appear before the rich socialist doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to find a home they can not seem to find. But these two have other plans in mind: when they discover that George's wife is out of town, they eventually take control of the residence, tie George, killing a delivery man while destroying the place in one evening. Weird and disturbing film, but the two are rewarding in the same weird way that the film ends. Most people will not like it or get caught up in this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes of film. Anyway, some even consider it a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
