I may have seen worse movies than that, but if I have them, I do not remember them. Or maybe blocked them. Who knows, if I had to follow a hypnotherapy, I might remember themselves, perhaps with extraterrestrial abduction while they were children or other traumas. If this is the case, I would gladly exchange these memories against those I saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give credit to the film: it provoked an emotional reaction. In fact, I started to be angry at scenes that distorted other movies and TV shows, that this parody dirtyed them by association. I'm terrified of not being able to see movies like Dr. Strangelove's again without this film falling into my eyes.
