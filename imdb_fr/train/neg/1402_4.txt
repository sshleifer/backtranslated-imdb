The dynasty revisited in Hawaii ... full of clich√©s, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. However, if you have nothing better to do, it provides 40 minutes of simple and unpretentious entertainment, lets you watch endlessly large male and female muscles and very good pictures of the spectacular Hawaiian landscape. On the other hand, if you are looking for something else, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know something about it, you've two options: 1. you will feel sick every two minutes at the stupidity and stupidity of the presentation of the Hotel Business show or, 2. look at it like a sci-fi comedy as I did, stretch out you, relax and laugh it!
