I did not know how to rate this movie, since it was so bad that it was actually very funny. I'm absolutely not a fan of Gackt, even if he has talent, despite the strange pseudonym that looks like a cat spitting a ball of hair. I always thought that Hyde had talent, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on this subject, guys. This film is ridiculous. It's so exaggerated and absurd that it's almost a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no plot, except it's just vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost made me think of Spider-Man 3, with too many ideas, which meant that we did not have time to pay attention to one of them. they. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were laughable. . Edited quickly, almost hard to understand, with such a ridiculously bad choreography. Although Hyde seemed very stylish during the action scenes, it is the only buyout of this film. I'm stupid for good action movies, but the action was horribly well done. Although the final shootout went well and was the culmination of this otherwise depressing film. <br /> <br /> He continues to jump between genres, it's not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, an action movie, a horror or a love story ... what is hell. <br /> <br /> If this opinion drives you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not be mistaken, this movie is bad.
