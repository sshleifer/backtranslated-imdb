Given his title and extravagant box art, I was ready for anything. My expectations were maybe a little too high, because I was a little dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie ends up in a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide that the best way to spend the evening is to make love . Where has this configuration not been used before? The difference here is the extremely perverse nature of sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (shoulder shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is veiled), the film strives to show the viewer how sex can be unnatural. <br /> In the midst of all the evil events, a monster of mud (which I do not know the origin) appears and begins to murder men and rape women ... then to murder them too . Some faces are a little heavy, especially a woman with intestines torn from her vagina or another woman spitting a mouthful of ... stuff, but otherwise the blood is pretty ordinary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is drawn by its own conceptions; he is too sexed to be a horror image right and too horrible to function like a sex movie. Mediums can work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
