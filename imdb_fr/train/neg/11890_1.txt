From the first time I saw the cover of the film and the stretched photograph, I thought this guy, this friend of the "Scwarz" should look like 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet tall. Not that, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> Whatever the score, I shot the movie on a cool night in Tucson, on the second floor with a good cigar and I let it roll. At that time, my wife had an affair and things were fine for me, so I needed a good distraction. But, as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot too, I'll admit it maybe. <br /> <br /> In truth, I watched this movie several times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that it's "trying too much" to be cool or "it's so close" to hit the mark of an action movie ... it's frantic. And then really clueless. Then frantic again. This is the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene. Sensational!! I have never felt safer in my life. Hot and happy too. I was grateful that they had saved gasoline during the hunt, because of less production in the summer ... anywho <br /> <br /> The direction was not inspired, the sequences of Action and combat had to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and tightened, the sound was off, the broadcast did not hit you, it kept going in the other direction. The "inhabitants" of the village where they were, the city rather, were "badly informed", they also did not seem to follow what was going very well, they would look and even "look" in the camera lens . As a deer in the head somehow lights up with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because "Columbu", I bet we have a good heart and a benevolent spirit towards the Americans, as well as for his own compatriots. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta Island" is very lethargic and incredible. Even so, I love him a lot. My now x-woman hate it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> What's funny is that I'm discriminating enough when it comes to movies I like or even like. Overall, I like Franco. There it is. <br /> <br /> As a movie that adds an addendum to this, if you like to lose a few hours with a lot of fun watching, skip to B-movies or "bad" movies from your small library collection , then, if you can find Go see 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar..you know the big guy from' TANGO & CASH '. 'The Big Sweat', a bomb of a cop that has no real plot or a lame actor's game that it could just as well be 'on crutches' and at the end of' The Big Sweat 'I think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and they just put it on fire and let it burn during the credits. -Good fun. <br /> <br /> But overall, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave it a "1" and an overall rating of "awful" for the B-terrible movie. I'm waiting for the rest, maybe like "Baretta's Revenge on Montazuma" (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water, then declares war on the water company) or "The War of Baretta Powder" "where he would argue a big drug lord in his country and chemically splice gene and create a super hybrid bug (insect) that would be high and threw in the cocaine fields and eat the coke and passing through the virus he forms a chemical reaction that turns coke into pure powdered sugar. Then, he would need another sequel to save the young from their excessive dependence on sugar, etc. He could use a large toothpaste company to finance and partly finance the project by carefully placing the product in the function. Right?(*)
