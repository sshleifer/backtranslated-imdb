There was something here with the female lead having the perfect life that she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting as a prostitute child and ending with Eric Roberts. But his background does not allow him to trust Dean Cain and it ends up destroying him completely. It sounds strange, but I like Dean Cain's position at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of her child (I think the lapse of time makes it clear that it's his child and not his brother's), but he can not forgive him for all that she has done, sleep with her brother (which shows the love and obligation he felt to be pretty much one-way), then be part of his death. In better hands, it would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on a cable in the late evening, it's not bad.
