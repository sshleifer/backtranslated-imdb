Designed only to annoy (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director had wanted the viewer to hate the main character, it would have been acceptable, but I know that there is no Hollywood director who would criticize the pro-Marxist movement of the 1960s, especially not a filmmaker. 70s. There are so many idiots dialogues here that sometimes I wondered if I was not really watching a comedy. You would not be faulty to think that it's a satire ?? that's how the film seems naive. Spacek is one of his left-wing films, which brings me to the obvious and inevitable conclusion that the redhead is one of those Liberal morons in Hollywood. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice breasts, but not for the brains.
