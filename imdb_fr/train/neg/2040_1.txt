It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the Blockbuster guy that they should take him off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. On the box, it says "the director of the boogeyman", so I thought ... well, if it was done recently, I'm sure the staging will not be at least TOO LONG: - \ but after seeing the movie and watching what "boogeyman" they were talking about, it was an absurdity of the early 1980s that he did. A great way to make rope to unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> ALWAYS, I think they just liked the name "Zodiac Killer", and did not bother to research the Zodiac's crimes, its MO, or even the years that he has been active. All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the "stories" about the original zodiac take place several years after the zodiac crimes. They also compare the Zodiac to "Dusseldorf Vampire" Fritz Haarman throughout the film and quite often speak to Fritz's "son". The Zodiac and Haarman are not the same, and it makes more sense to compare it to BTK who also shot people, not to a man who killed people by nibbling his neck. None of Haarman's facts are accurate either, just a bunch of mixed nonsense. His son even says "Do not forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's" ... His current name has only one! I think the screenwriter / director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and that the fastest ones that were mentioned were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Ooh, it sounds like cool names, let's do a movie about them without doing any outside research! Good idea!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this film is the way in which the experts and the young killer describe that he is suffering from the DSM-IV and is cured of it. "I have also been diagnosed with the DSM-IV and have recovered since," etc. For those of you who do not know it, the DSM-IV is the psychological manual of mental disorders. If someone suffers from the book itself, he must have serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> Anyway, what counts is at the bottom of my list of the 5 worst movies of all time, and it is rare for a movie to reach this stage. But, if you want to watch a story totally devoid of facts about serial killers that turns out to be just boring, full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational, I would say this movie is to watch. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked how the killer "gassed" some of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch ...
