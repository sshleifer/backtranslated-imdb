Some movies you take for a book are pretty good - the 23rd century movies released dozens of obscure Italian and American films that were excellent, but although Hardgore released some of Fulci's movies and more, their production is a shit like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's not nearly as boring as Stink of Flesh. Apart from that, it's a very awkward anthology film with the technical skill of a Lego house built by a whelk. <br /> <br /> It has been noted elsewhere, but you really need to worry about a movie that inserts clips of the action into its credit sequence, so that when attacking zombies, you have already seen everything. <br /> <br /> Bad moviegoers will have a balloon watching the 18,000 errors of continuity and the hellish cast game (especially the hitchhiker, which was so bad that it made me laugh a little ), and congratulations to Hardgore for being so clever in mind by publishing such a bad impression that I felt like watching a video defeated at home on a camping trip. <br /> <br /> A dreadful thing. We all did these things when we had the camera, but common sense prevails and these movies hang in our closets somewhere. To avoid.
