Six GIs, about to be sent home and fired, get drunk and sneak into a worship meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded characters, two dancers pretend to argue. Behind them, on an altar, a braided basket opens and a painted figure emerges and begins to imitate a snake, finally biting one of the dancers around his neck. The imitation of the snake is dressed in a pantyhose for the scaly body. The sect member who infiltrated them in the secret meeting warned the six men several times that the ceremonies should not be interrupted and that, obviously, no photo should be taken, otherwise they will be hunted. down and killed. Naturally, the GIs take a flash photo, send the cult members in angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and flee into the Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the guys, the most offensive and sarcastic, dies of a cobra bite around his neck, although no one can explain how the snake entered his hospital room. <br /> <br /> Back in New York, it seems rather old as new men move into civilian life while maintaining their ties. Their jobs range from the manager of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to a graduate student in research (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a beautiful blonde friend. Kelly is a somewhat rash womanizer. But they all get along pretty well and all seem happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark and mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) introduces herself and Marshall Thompson appreciates it and insinuates it into the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what's going on. First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then, Kelly receives the visit of Domergue. Something frightens him so much that he falls by the window and dies in the fall on the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows, namely that Domergue played a role in the deaths. They also believe that it may turn into a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with her suspicions and she proves her point of view. <br /> <br /> At the time, Long and Thompson were completely upset, especially Thompson, who was in love with Domergue and discovered that she was attracted to him too. , although he must explain to her what "love" is. It does not matter. A last reckless attack of the woman cobra against Long's girlfriend - not one of the six alleged perpetrators - and Thompson has to throw the snake out the window. On the sidewalk below, the body changes to that of Domergue. The end. <br /> <br /> I think I'll skip most of the issues raised by the plot. I will mention in passing one of the most prosaic. Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia in New York? Who pays his electricity bills at the hotel? Who paid for his spectacular wardrobe? How is it that she speaks American English so well? What is happening? The writers and the director clearly saw some of Val Lewton's modest horror films, and although little effort was devoted to this production, they shamelessly stole gadgets from Lewton. In Lewton's "The Cat People", for example, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with a very small exception, the threat is still kept in the shadows and is even more terrifying for her. Most transformations here also use shadows, but unlike Lewton's, they are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also occasionally used what he called "bus". Lewton's first "bus" was literal. A potential victim rushes alone into the dark tunnels of Central Park with only footsteps. Something or someone follows her. It freezes with terror under a street lamp. Something makes the branches of the shrubs hover over her. She looks up. There is a powerful, whistling cry that makes your hair stand up. It's a bus that uses its pneumatic brakes to stop for it. The producers have used at least two "buses" in this film and they are worthless. A guy runs absently through an intersection, for example, and there is the sudden roar of a truck that almost hits him. There is no installation for the shot. He is stuck with a shoe horn. <br /> <br /> Movies that perpetuate the stereotype of sticky, ugly, venomous and phallic snakes do not bother me. In fact, no snake is slimy, most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful. In addition, they are more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and their serpentine approach to goals. Do you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? Try a six-line runner. It's a very fast lizard. When he sees something to eat, he rushes to swallow it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see scary movies on a budget, do not bother with this one. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces, which is an obvious copy.
