I just watched guinea pigs - Devils. I must say that this film, although having very good effects, better than I expected, was NOT a good movie. Honestly, I can not say that I really enjoyed this movie. Of course, it's effective in being a shocking, realistic, 43-minute distorted torture, but I found it very boring (and not as bloody as I hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very boring, when they spoke and tried to ring hard all the time, it spoiled it even more (and I'm sure there are people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen the guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best among those who, in my opinion, is the guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not talk much more about the Devils experience, apart from Great fx, the girl's offspring, the annoying executioners, in general, I give it 4 stars because of special effects because they are awesome.
