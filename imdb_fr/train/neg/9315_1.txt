This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was horrible! I can not emphasize it enough! The acting, the staging, the story, the characters and everything else were bad! It was so old and cliche. Do not be fooled by the cover or slogan "The" Texas slaughter "does not make you laugh." Are you making fun of me? It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first two minutes of the film are satisfactory until the main character, Brendan, is found, OK, turn it off. What I understood in the movie is that a group of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the woods and a clown who sings rhymes kills them in a non-original and fictitious way. . This film was a waste of time and money, and it would also be a waste of time and money! I move quickly through almost the entire movie because it was so horrible. I just wanted to see how every bad actor was dying and it WAS STILL NOT worth it! Watching the blanket is a waste of time. It's really the worst movie of all time! Note: do not deserve one.
