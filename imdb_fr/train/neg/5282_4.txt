I must admit that I am seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not in any way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I looked at this is that I was not completely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones was much more like the captain I had imagined reading the book. And him too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only quality that redeems the film. The rest is as close as possible to Austen. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER have walked the streets of Bath that way. It was not in her character and it just was not done by a lady of the time. Anne Elliot of the book was a woman and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but it was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at times quite inappropriate, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book will be missing or will be completely altered . <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is rushed. Very little care has been taken to present the characters, to show their dispositions and their motivations. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they have slit the final scenes in this way? A disaster ! And he was by far not as nicely photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you like Austen, do not waste your time with that.
