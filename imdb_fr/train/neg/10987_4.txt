I really enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel, The Robber Bride, and was delighted to see that there is a movie version. A woman charges a murder against a policeman's boyfriend. His friend, a journalist from the former police officer, tries to clarify his name by watching the crazy friends of the deceased. He is happy that the script of the film corrects Ms. Atwood's clumsy plot by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of intriguing women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Ok, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book and I'm pretty sure they're all made up for the movie, I'll eat the jacket of my hard copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the film. Zenia's manipulations are only interesting if we see them coming to a man, and a man's life is done. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - to a man. Because it's not important if a man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them put aside for a man's story. Normally, I do not look for a feminist angle in the media and I tried to enjoy the film as it is. If I had not read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and want to know more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel if you want to enjoy the succulent prose and superimposed characterization in a plot. It's the same scenario: the film searched him, ironed him and sprayed him with male anguish. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
