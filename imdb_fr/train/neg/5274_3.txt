If you like movies about cities, hotels, homes, states (like the "California Hotel" Eagles), etc., that have "passing" characters, read almost all of Stephen King's novels instead. . If you like the "Disappearance" setting, start by reading King's "Despair", but also check out "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> The raven's motive, the desert, the family that drives desperately to escape or avoid possession is tired. Why did not they do the movie of the novel "Desperation"? Maybe they approached King and he got nixed? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be reunited and have both done well over the years, but they are still TV-style and DVD players.
