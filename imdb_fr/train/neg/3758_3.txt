When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually, when you have these types of movies, there is usually a sasquatch, but in this one, it looks like what? 7 or 10 of them? Act was good, the plot was OK, I liked the scenes where the sasquatch kills the first victims, very good camera work. I was expecting it to be a bloody movie but it was very little. This film was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really has to do more Sasquatch movies, I mean I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm reviewing is OK, but the Sasquatch movie was not but I do not review it let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for any other occasion, no.
