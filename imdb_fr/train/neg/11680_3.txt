This film had so much potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I do not know where everything went wrong, but each of these items was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were hollow and the result was a boring and useless film mess. I hated. Judging by the other votes, I am in the minority here and I must be a little weird. However, I thought this movie was terrible. I had high hopes but I was very disappointed. Jody Foster's character was particularly disappointing. A very arrogant "fixer" makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always played - nice but nothing new.
