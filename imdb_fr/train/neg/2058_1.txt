I can find very few good things to say about this movie. I'm sure that the idea and the script did look good on paper, but filmography and acting are not at all what I expected from very talented people. I doubt that this figure strongly in their CV Filmography. Michael Caine seemed to play wood sometimes in his role as a doctor, and at no time did I really believe in his character. The plot was incredible, especially with regard to the victim's son. Some scenes were reminiscent of many other films, which I sometimes wondered if it was actually a parody thriller. The light was sometimes dark, which added to the sensation of watching a low budget movie with big name stars, wondering why I did not bother to watch it.
