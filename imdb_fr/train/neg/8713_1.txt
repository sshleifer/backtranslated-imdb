Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine with the army uniform, ten sizes too big, is so terrible with the permanent attempt of the leader of a group of special operations is hilarious! The "terrorists" are as scary and realistic as the "raptors", it's so ridiculous and bad at everything you try to make laugh. The part where the giant T-REX sneaked aboard a then somewhere down there, we blow up and we see the metal pole stand where his head was the perfect end. If you like bad movies, it's the pot of gold, the mona lisa of bb-bad !!!
