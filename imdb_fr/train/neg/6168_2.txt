Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... ok, two of my friends and I ordered a pizza, we sat down and we wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something uncomfortable, but funny like Versus. But the naked blood sucked. It is a complete waste. Okay, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite remarkable. But that's all. No more no less. I will not summarize the plot, other people have already done it, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch him and evaluate yourself. Perhaps we could push the note where it should be. One last thing comes to mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter has ever been - okay, John is cool ... :) 2/10
