As for the movie, it's a sci-fi movie OK. It contains a lot of interesting things and quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some things are pretty far away ... <br /> <br /> As far as calling that, another movie-cube is completely amazing! This is the very definition of milking an original film awesome and inventive ... We can somehow translate this impression in the heart of the first film, but the introduction of people / androids in the team "behind" the cube him It's a little exaggerated ... <br /> <br /> I gave it a 3 *** because of the blows in the back of the original. This one should have remained sterile in so many parts of the film that there is neither place nor time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Visible to look for those who did not see Cube & Hypercube, but it's not recommended for fans of the series ...
