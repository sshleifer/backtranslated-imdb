If this film spoke of a fictional character, the film could be autonomous and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" shaded unfairly to Ruben Carter. Many minor facts were ignored (Carter was NOT the number one competitor at the time of the murders, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some the most important facts, such as apparently being robbed of a decision made by Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable for those of us who have seen the fight on tape and who is totally disrespectful towards Giardello. Why does Hollywood feel the need to make a hero of someone who, at best, was in trouble much more than a normal person should be (was arrested several times for beating women), it's strange to me. Ruben Carter has never been, looking at his actions in the '60s and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can admire. Everyone knows that Jewison can lead, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story because their vehicle exceeds me. Does Hollywood so badly need a black hero that they need to reveal the truth in all their organic photos to make them believable? (Here's a suggestion, why is Denzel filming himself?) It's now a source of inspiration.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest passing it on.
