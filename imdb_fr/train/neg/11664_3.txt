I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. He moved very slowly and was just boring. If it had been on television, it might have been 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? A superb cast and a photographer were working on faulty foundations. If this is vaguely based on the director's life, why did not he ask someone to see that the writing itself was "cowardly". Then he steered it with a turtle, which may have caused some people to fall asleep during the film. The music is skyrocketing, but for a different film, not this one .... for a soap opera saga eventually. There were times when dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone, because I heard some rumors about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood produce better movies? This one had the nugget of a beautiful story, but was just badly executed.
