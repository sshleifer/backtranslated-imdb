This is a typical slasher movie "Right to the toilet". <br /> <br /> In short, a group of teenagers / young adults find themselves stuck in the middle of scary woods and are crushed by nymphomaniac demons naked. <br /> <br /> This film contains all the basics of slasher cheese: <br /> <br /> the survivor being a well-built young woman who will always show her belly, but will never support less, - a terrifying man and crazy who knows the harm, - a lesbian kiss scene, - sex is a killer, - no plot <br /> <br /> Even then for a cheese slasher movie, it was really terrible. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to capture the interest of male and female audiences. Looking at him, one has the impression of looking at him with a big congestion in the head or a bad cold. <br /> <br /> Give to the demoniacs ..... 0/10.
