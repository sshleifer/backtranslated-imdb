A man takes his new wife home, where his ex-wife died as a result of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also VERY rich! Suddenly, she begins to hear noises and see skulls everywhere. Does she go crazy again or does the first woman come back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the end, so I will not explain it. I saw him several times on Saturday afternoon on television when I was a child. At the time, I loved it but I was young. Seeing him now, I realize how bad it is. It is horribly played, poorly written, very dull (even at one o'clock) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (including the director)! There are some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit scary and the setting with the huge empty house and the nearby pond is pleasantly atmospheric. There are also some scary moments (I jumped a bit when she saw the first skull) and a pretty effective ending. Overall, it's certainly not a good movie ... but not a total disaster either. He has a little worship next. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid its Elite DVD Drive-in edition (associated with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). He is in terrible shape with jumps and scratches everywhere. It did not even look so bad on TV!
