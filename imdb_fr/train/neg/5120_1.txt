It's not a movie, it's a 111-minute Christian evangelical sermon draped over America's number one US football, American football. Another of the most sincere long messages to converts who are then supposed to be motivated enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> A dialogue like "You won the big when you accepted Christ" loses all possible attraction of the camp by the disturbing intensity of the dark eyes plunged by director / coach Alex Kendrick. Then come the "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain, but only one prepared his field to receive it. Which do you think God has blessed? This rhetorical question is intended to prefigure the miraculous climax, during which the coach asks his fast-paced back-up kicker: "My son, do you think God could help you give this shot?" This is the kind of entertainment that would have been expected that would receive denominational funding ad infinitum, if only the hegemonic efforts of the evangelical Christian Bush administration around the world had convinced us to become "devotees" to their example. See this poor Giants coach in the apocalyptic finale, urging his team to shout, "Who's with me!" While the Eagles devotees on the other side quietly did the Lord's work. <br /> <br /> Do you think our terrified support is trying to defeat these self-centered Goliaths? We all know that fanatics can not lose. Formulate it as follows: transfer the playground to the deserts of the Middle East, replace Christian proselytism, and this virulent nonsense can easily be reformulated into a Taliban versus superpower parable, to which fervent worshipers of this waste might think. about a minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they do not care and do not need to: as the coach tells his team of empty ships before the match, the answers are given here in this book. And the Christian right will devour him on the path of the rapture, the final victory for which they have prepared their fields.
