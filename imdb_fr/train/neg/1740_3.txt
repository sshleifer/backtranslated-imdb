The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since he was led by Priyadarshan, he was sad to see such lamentable standards. A mediocre scenario (almost nonexistent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the strangest moments annihilate the humor offered by the film. some scenes were funny, but that was probably only 5 minutes of the whole duration. The editing was pathetic. Dismal! Overall, the film was disappointed because the lack of story was all too obvious. In fact, only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. <br /> <br /> We would not miss anything if we do not watch the movie. No need to spend precious money on this movie. wait until he appears on TV ...
