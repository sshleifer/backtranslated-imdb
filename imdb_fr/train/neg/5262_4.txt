We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said, "So you made me watch the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened." He did not "fabricate" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The body of the movie was pretty good. There was a lot of suspense. It made you think. Then came the end. The end was ... well, it just came out. You did not let people know what happened or why. Until the credits, I thought there would be something left to explain it, but it never happened. So I came here thinking that someone had understood and I was not paying attention. Nope. Four years later, I'm as helpless as Tom Sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what happened. I'm just glad I did not waste my money buying it because I would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I understood! The end of the film is what has disappeared! ROFL
