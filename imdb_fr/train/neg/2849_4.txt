Some compare this film with "The Last Detail", but "Chasers" is flatter than a portion of interstate highway in West Texas. And as the landscape in the desert, nothing really distinguishes it, not even the fact that a prisoner is carried by two escorts of the navy this time. Nobody in the distribution is doing too well; with this lame script it's not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not leave much room for this one if he ever writes a memoir, I do not think so.
