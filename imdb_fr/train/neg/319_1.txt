One of my friends bought this movie for Â£ 1 and the price was still excessively high. Despite the presence of big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredible talent of Burt Young, this film was as funny as taking a chisel and piercing in the ears. He uses tired comedy techniques at the bottom of the barrel - constantly breaking the fourth wall while Sandler talks to the audience and seemingly useless fixtures of "hot girls". <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship that wants to succeed as a comedian in order to succeed with women. When the resident comedian of the ship, called shamelessly "Dickie" because of his unfathomable success with the opposite sex, is presumed lost at sea, the character of Sandler, Shecker, gets his big success. Dickie is not dead, he is rather locked in the bathroom, probably sick of the sea. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his mouth has just vomited the worst film of all time.
