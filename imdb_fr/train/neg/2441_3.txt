I thought that "intensive care" was pretty bad and very funny without wanting it. But at least not as bad as I thought. Sometimes it's a bit suspensive, but never a good shock. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The pleasure lies in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment of all time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He moans in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks, "Poor Peter, can I get you a bandage?" <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. To save costs, all license plates are from the United States and the background of the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan. Very funny if you are Dutch and you are watching the original version in Dutch.
