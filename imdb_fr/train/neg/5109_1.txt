"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling of well-being", called "warming of heart", and an out-of-the-ordinary show that shows ABC has had time to prepare. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that these families experience. For that, I'm sorry. But do not you think that installing four large-screen plasma TVs, three flat-screen desktops, an in-ground pool occupying half of the backyard, and closets filled with expensive designer clothing is a little too much for any family? Of course, these families have gone through a lot of things. Of course, they deserve more enjoyable things than they had before. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his team have installed in these homes are ample for a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me in this series is the way Ty and his team always have something positive to say about every little thing about the family or the condition of the family. Tell a person in a wheelchair that she is "so strong" or "very brave" really gets older after a while. It may seem rude, but believe me; watch this show and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In the end, this show is overestimated. If you want to watch it, go for it. This comment is just a warning for what you are looking at.
