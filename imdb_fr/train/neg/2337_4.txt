I do not know what the hype is about this ... It's really a bad movie ... it did not do anything to me, the only downhill scene is the one where everyone meets at the party and where a beautiful song is played, an edifying and pleasant beat of cinematic scenes that move ... it was the best part of the film ... Otherwise, this film lacks everything to crack the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think about, as some people say, there is no cohesion of different stories ... it was more of an attempt to redo the 'Magnolia' of Anderson which was brilliant, but it flagrantly fails ... Well, it's light and easy to watch, but it's also MovieClips. Maybe you first write a story before making a film ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've seen
