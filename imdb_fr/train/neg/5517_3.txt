I only note this film as a pity 3 because it tries to be worth it. I like to praise a good movie and I'm not a fan of "male" movies. Legally blonde was a great movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written and unrealistic example of the worst film making. at the end of the movie, I did not care who was lying or if something was resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is weak and never develops (the fact that the subject is deep does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character undergoes a major character change and is prepared for that change during the movie. In Georgia Rule, character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many dynamic characters ATTEMPTING. Shooting a very good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (there are only a few hours left in a movie). This means that too many tempted dynamic characters will not have enough attention for their personal change. Even if I do not know the badly written story and the reach of dynamic and weak characters, I can not even say that I love anyone. Each character was a mess. It's good if you write American Beauty, but not if you're trying a drama. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no, I do not let her go because she was molested, shit gets to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). The Mormon kid from "Dudley Do Right" should have had the courage not to compromise his religion and his commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy does a 17-year-old girl who was assaulted to stay from time to time (unless he an actor or politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remember what a good movie is NOT!
