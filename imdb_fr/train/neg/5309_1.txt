I saw the movie late one night on the cable and I could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so shocking that it was not even entertaining. Among the highlights of this film are the absurd music that is constantly being broadcast throughout the film, the horrible special effects (when someone shoots with a laser gun, it turns green neon and disintegrates quickly) and the disgusting game . The acting game, in fact, is what I feel stealing the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film and I hope I never have to see them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can not imagine a video store carrying this waste) just so you can learn to enjoy quality movies after seeing this trash.
