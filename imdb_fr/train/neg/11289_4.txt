Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have pills for that now!) Is probably the weakest element in this series. This really continues the tired formula of the Highlander series - The immortal hero meets another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is a conflict and there is a fight at the sword in the end where you have a sequence of cheap special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unsighted 90s hero, with the typical scenario of "sexual tension". (Seriously, why do Hollywood guys think sexual tension is more interesting than sex?) It was a joint Canada / French production. Half of the series takes place in Vancouver, in imitation of New York, and the other half is in Paris. as did Highlander.
