First of all, let me start with this article by saying that I am a fan of Star Wars original movies ... I do not read books, play games, wear underwear and do not eat cereals (if there is one) I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> That being said, I have trouble understanding how people give this film such praise. By taking this film alone, without comparing it to its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say it's an incredible movie. Despite all the terrible shortcomings of the script - nerdy dialogues, artificial scenes (R2 is suddenly a tough guy, and long scenes of intense pursuit in CGI that have little human contact), HORRIBLE play, and the holes of the intrigue noticed ... how is it good? ? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; it just seemed that a switch had been reversed and that it had suddenly become evil. I was not interested in the film before the last 20 minutes (which was also ruined by Frankenstein's "NOOOOOO!" Scene). When you BOMB the screen with CGI effects extremely amazing and you fill the gaps with absolutely atrocious linings while others could and should have been said, this is NOT a GREAT FILM. For a film with a tone as "dark", the speech of ALL characters was too light. <br /> <br /> I end with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was about to unfold?
