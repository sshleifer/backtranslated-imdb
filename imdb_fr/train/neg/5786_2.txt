When you look at this now and you hear all the languages ​​here, it's amazing that it's been classified as "PG", but that's the 1970s scoring system for you. Peter Falk spits out the name of the Lord in vain six times during the first ten minutes only in this movie! Yet, few people consider this attitude shocking, and certainly not the scumbags that make movies, nor those who "write" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is a clue to the desecration of this film: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not actors you will not find in "The Sound Of Music ". <br /> <br /> I like burglary movies and a lot of director William Friedkin's films, but this script did not produce the desired results and he has too much to his credit the feeling of "Sleazy '70s", visually and audibly. For those who liked Falk in "Columbo" on TV, it was a shock to hear him use as much profanity as in the movies. This is far from the only case.
