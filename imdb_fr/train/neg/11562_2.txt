The rich widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic and British Lord lover. He brings sexy redheads to his castle, whipping and killing them. The black boots stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) moves away temporarily. Mr. Steffen is haunted by his wife "Evelyn", who died in childbirth. In therapy, he decides to remarry, after meeting the pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (under the name of Gladys). At the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more graves. "The night Evelyn came out of the grave" is at least an excellent title. <br /> <br /> ** Evelyn's best idea fell (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen
