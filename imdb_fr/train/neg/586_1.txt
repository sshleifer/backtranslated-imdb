After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It was just not the same without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas describes it. Perhaps he had recognized how poor the plot was - Jim returns after a prolonged absence to find Jessica pursued by another man. He could not expect a girl to wait so long without any contact from him and find no competition. For a Disney movie, it contains a vulgar language, plus the very useless part when Jim and Jessica mutilated themselves without being married - very LAME. An insult to the viewer's intelligence, according to the members of my family. I will stay with the first one, and try to forget that I have never seen more!
