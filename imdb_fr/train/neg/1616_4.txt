EVALUATIONS IN STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> This second part of the film Che takes the story to the next late 60s, where the man has now moved his resistance to the hills of South America, surviving without enough food and water and with increasing tensions between groups. Everything reaches its peak when it crosses the border with Bolivia and the government forces intensify their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without the gap between time and place of the last film, the second opus of Soderbergh focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even duller experience. And more pretentiously, the score has been drowned, which gives the second part an air of undesirable artist who proves just as alienating. There is just an air of immovable boredom in the film that never lets go. You can not blame Soderbergh's ambition or the coaching of Del Toro in the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production, things have managed to take such a disappointing turn. **
