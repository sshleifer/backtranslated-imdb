A black fighter ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 1/10. Obviously fiction. <br /> <br /> We are therefore presented with a nice title, a very nice slogan and even a beautiful plot .. That's it, that's where it ends .. We enter the fiction that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, the black guy, do not get me wrong with his name .. represents a black man .. Umm, that's all there is to know .. <br /> <It's so hard to find decent help, it took hiring black friends to help cause the small budget, the low inaptitude of this film, the shadow of the camera hangs behind the first scenes ... dude like you and me .. but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. submitted examination,. if you paid to watch this movie, you got fooled.
