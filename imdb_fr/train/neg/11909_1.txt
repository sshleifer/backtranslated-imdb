I think I found the most misogynistic movie of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The Essence of the Movie - Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banned from the Garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's. equal and refused to submit to him. You see, I took those words directly from the script. Then the film continues and although she is the heroine of the film, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith - an all-male band! <br /> <br /> Other than that, the scenario was predictable and FX effects terrible. Apart from the obvious hatred of women who is generally much more subtle in modern films, Darklight is not original.
