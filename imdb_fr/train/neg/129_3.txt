I'm curious is really two movies in one half - it's Lena's experimental sexual side and the other half is his curiosity with politics / socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two do not really fit together. The director should have stayed with Lena's romantic side and made a separate film for politics. There is a strange mix of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, overflowing breasts and pubic hair. The film is more like a fiction documentary than a movie. In addition to the interesting sex scenes, you will not be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other critics, I think that nude / sexual scenes are exaggerated for what they are. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. Ubiquitous nudity is a major distraction from the plot. I think, however, that the actors have done a good job. They played their roles in a credible way. I am so used to seeing American movies during this period.
