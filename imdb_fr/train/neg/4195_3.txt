Given the people involved, it's hard to see why this movie should be so disorganized and so boring. The writer, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film "The Sting" two years later. Jane Fonda had just won an Oscar for Klute and Donald Sutherland had just done a remarkable job in films like "Klute", "Start the Revolution Without Me" and "Kelly's Heroes." Basically, the film is a story of capers, with a small group of clumsy outsiders planning a big holdup. At the same time, the film is intended to satirize the hip, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the television series "Saturday Night" of NBC would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy pieces look clumsy and forced and the disconnected comedy pieces destroy any kind of suspense the thief might have. It's literally a film that keeps crashing, just as the cars in the demolition scenes intersect. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was to watch Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a light version of her dramatic prostitute character Bree Daniels in "Klute". Yet, we do not believe it for a moment. It's always Jane Fonda who masquerades as a prostitute we watch. It is a performance as terrible as that of "Klute". It would be a good lesson for theatrical teachers to shoot both films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that actors are only worth their authors and directors.
