Considered as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty, which speaks of unemployed in Sheffield, this film is a fake. <br /> <br /> As a person born in Sheffield and still connected to the city, I was extremely disappointed by this film. Someone said it could have happened in Oklahoma, which sums up pretty much everything for me. It sounded like a romantic vision of the North of England made for the American market. Many Americans - and many people in southern England - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of about half a million people with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants, he was portrayed as a sullen, dead-end, semi-rural town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to be drinking in the same old-fashioned pub and where the idea of ​​a party was a catchy one in a village hall. look alike. It was a small united community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The men of Sheffield's working class were totally different from their real-life counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and briefs. dry remarks. They do not argue and certainly do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even rural areas, supposedly located in the Peak District, seemed foreign to me. I recognized a few places where I was hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons in a dark landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end, I spotted a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, in summer, creeping with walkers and tourists by car. It is located between two major cities. It's not a kind of desert. <br /> <br /> As for the idea that a young woman could fall in love with Pete Postlethwaite and lust after her, it was ridiculous and could only be a male dream. Her reasons for becoming her lover never appeared. None of the men were shown to have a partner or families; they existed in the void. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wanted to see a film about the unemployed Sheffielders would have been lost. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its writers and filmmakers of the middle class. <br /> <br /> It was a gigantic fake! <br /> <br />
