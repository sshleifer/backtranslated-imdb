Michael, five years old, sees his mother being put to death by his father, the serial killer "The Highwayman", who commits suicide later. "20 years later," Mike (Gordon Currie, of PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invited seven of his friends to his isolated grandparents to "control their own fears" at a Halloween costume party. Morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman, becomes possessed by the deceased father's spirit and kills them using their phobias. The characters are thrown out the window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, exploded, etc. Morty turns into a dad and a tree, walks around and does silly stupid things. After finding a girl chopped and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay in the house, play with gaiety, joke and make love. <br /> <br /> Morty's drawing is good and Betsy Palmer (Ms. Voorhees from The Original Friday, 13th) is astonishingly delightful as a grandmother, but this thing is even more insane and confusing than the original and full of false scares, bad actors, stupid characters, repetitive flashbacks and annoying camera problems. Moreover, the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. BLA BLA!
