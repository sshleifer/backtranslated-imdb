In the standard view, it is a purely awful movie. However, he attributes an almost perfect score to the scale of unintentional comedy. I can think of some comedies that make me laugh as hard as I watched this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith wearing a Native American dancer dress makes me fall into hysteria. I would not waste gas or energy by going to the video store to rent it, but if you're lying on the couch at 3 am and playing it on TV, throw it away. 'eye.
