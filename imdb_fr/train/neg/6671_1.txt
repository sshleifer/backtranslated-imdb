I felt that the film had started well. The acting was perfect and I felt the situation of all the characters, even if the real family unit was not completely revealed. We never had enough information about the father to really feel the pain of his involvement or the accumulation of his animosity with Tobe. I mean in one scene, we see him admire it for his tension and in another scene, he disguises it. Another problem with the movie was that he had just unraveled himself and had lost all focus at the end, and I just begged him to finish. Any movie with such a long and painful end should never get an automatic score of 7 or more just for the acting. We examine the overall quality of the cinematic experience. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously considered going out of the theater. This film caught me inside and spit me out.
