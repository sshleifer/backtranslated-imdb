I can not believe I watched it last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago, I watched 6 of Fu's movies afterwards .. Boris Karloff and the 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both directed (and I use this word vaguely) by Jess Franco, were abominable. At the time, I skipped this one, reminding myself that in some ways it was even worse. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it. Never again. You know what's worse than an awful movie? A piece of S *** really well done. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. It's a very beautiful film. GREAT conception of production, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good distribution, some decent actors ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, one of the worst scenarios of the history of cinema !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so misleading ... we could take it for a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and the music gets worse. Having Burt Kwouk (whose owner says "Your face is familiar.") Accidentally spill Fu's elixir vitae to extinguish a fire, thus condemning him to torture, burial, and one of his cut ears, was the closest funny thing they had. It was as if someone had decided to make a movie "campy" - so ridiculous that it would be funny. RIDICULE is ... funny ... it does not work. At all. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a LOT of research on the Fu Manchu series in order to get as many "correct" results. With a different script - either really funny or serious, they might have - should have - should have had a classic in their hands. A film that could have forgotten the horror of these atrocities of Jess Franco ... instead of making them want to discover them as masterpieces, by comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 70s when a whole series of classic characters from the 30s were revived in universally terrible films. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure, this one is perhaps the worst of the lot. It took a lot of self-control not to move fast on large chunks, especially the scenes containing Sid Caesar (the FBI leader who was also Al Capone's cousin - you know what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the movie are not funny ... they often make NO SENSES. Like when they "audition" police officers to imitate the king and queen, we end up seeing people "auditioning" dance hall routines like singing, dancing, and riding on a unicycle. How many medicines did the authors of this thing have to take for it to make sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a shame ... and a real waste of all that talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who plays both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who was in a film of Chris Lee Fu in his day), Helen Mirren (the policewoman who falls in shock at the thunderbolt for the villain and steals almost the last half hour of the movie!). I'm starting to wonder if anyone will ever make a "good" Fu Manchu movie, or if fans will have to settle for Karloff being almost ONLY.
