I wandered in this movie after watching "Borat" for 82 minutes tonight and left rather disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit and I regularly went to see animated films. That being said, I found myself sleeping and at one point I was almost gone, but I was waiting for the improvement of this movie. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The graphics are breathtaking and the vocal work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remember a few times that the wicked bulbous lizard was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that it's one of those animated features for the ADD set. He registers afterwards as a zany wacky routine after another, weighed down by a plot filled with molasses that ends all the steps to try to transmit an "important message". For the animated category, it looks a lot like a flat Oscar. And considering the way he counts critics, I would not be surprised that the Academy is wrong and offers his equipment. But if you're looking for an animated feature film about rats, follow my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
