POPEYE AND LARGE FOOT **; POPEYE MOTOR COMPANY **; GETTING POPEYE GOAT ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used to make rabbits with that, but, grabbing an episode of the series that included three caricatures, many years later ( they preceded the theatrical projection of the pirate sons RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they do not resist very well! The character of Popeye is not quite friendly at first, Olive Oyl is distinctly domineering and the antics of Bluto have not aroused much interest either ?? In short, the scripts were extremely fine, quite horrible and generally not very funny. They are strictly reserved for minors, but I doubt that today's children even have the patience to stay with them! moreover, the animation style is unattractive. <br /> <br /> By taking each short film, I guess they were improving from one to another: after the initial shock, one was adapting to its poor quality, so that the third comic strip easily translates to being the most enjoyable of the lot? Popeye is entrusted with an army goat, mascot, whose immense appetite does not cause him any harm (not original, I know, but always a fun ploy). An interesting element here is that the short films were delivered with Popeye offering pieces of moralistic wisdom to the children in the audience.
