Despite a decent first season, this series has never achieved its full potential. This film, which foreshadowed the original "Star Trek" series, was condemned from the start by executive producer Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and narrow the definition of what could be a "Star" series. Trek "this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The presenter, Brannon Braga, did not solve the problem by repeating the previous episodes of Trek without fatigue and tiredness, and carelessly neglecting the internal mythology of the franchise (it was painfully obvious at the beginning that he only participated in the paycheck). I have never seen a series that hurt such a talented group of actors (except Jolene Blaylock) so badly. It is as if this entire series had been produced in an existing bubble outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) was more demanding and sophisticated in its desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems that Berman and Braga managed to convince senior Paramount executives that "Enterprise" was suffering from "frankness fatigue" and that its main audience had not left but had been hunted. Produce a quality offer up to the ideals and high standards of its predecessors and they (the public) will come. <br /> <br /> In summary, in a TeeVee universe where shows such as "Battlestar: Galactica" are proposed "and" The Shield ", the powers in place must offer viewers a" Star Trek "to the their height and extremely competitive.It's just that simple and easy.
