After several years of looking for mediocre films to rent for my children, I developed a sixth sense by highlighting the really ridiculous and video-driven efforts that are really painful to watch eight). I dropped the ball on this one and the children spent half the film asking me "why did she say that?" and "why did he do that?" and I hurt myself by having them rolled every minute or so, even though the characters were very bad at introducing complicated script changes. And the next time someone decides not to master a sword, it's just "bring realism" to a movie, run it with a blunt butter knife. "Préhystérie" was the head and shoulders above that. Arrgh.
