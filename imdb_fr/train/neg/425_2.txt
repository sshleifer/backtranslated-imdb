I can not believe I'm so angry after seeing this that I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing less than a dreaded planet on the planet Earth. I knew now that it was announced "by those who brought you planet Earth," but I did not know they were going to blatantly use the same scenes as the revolutionary documentary miniseries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already have on DVD. Shame on Disney for failing to warn people that there was absolutely nothing original here (except a James Earl Jones voice-over and 90 seconds sailboat which, I do not think, belonged to the planet Earth ). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime of all is that while planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as proof that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for change Ecological, Disney has taken this story to turn it into friendly tripe for families. After the disappearance of the male polar bear, they show his grandchildren significantly a year later and say that they are ready to perpetuate his memory and that the Earth is truly a beautiful place after all. No mention of the imminent death of small adults due to the same fate their father has endured, no warning of trouble for future generations if we do not take things in hand, nothing. Just a montage of things we've seen throughout the movie (and so much more, if you're part of the billion people who have already seen the planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I have never left the theater with such emotion. ashamed and deceived in my life.
