I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe and I really went looking for this movie (I needed a DVD of Region 5 in Chinese!). But it's really one of the worst I've known for a while. <br /> <br /> The acting game (with the exception of Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this film (although it is not credited as a director), and they have NO discernable talent for writing or directing. (Stick to Willem's acting, Giada get out of the deal, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Except for a series of totally unconvincing acts, totally devoid of credible motivation, on the part of these two people (who have just met) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I do not care about any expression, her form NEVER changes. And the sex scenes are downright lame. In fact, I cracked twice against one of them. Yuck! They are certainly not in the least erotic, and yet, this is the only time the film does not go to sleep. Then he's busy pushing you away. <br /> <br /> It's horrible.
