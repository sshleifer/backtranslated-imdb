whatever you do, do not waste your time on it. movie. A remake that does not need to be redistributed. All those who left the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I have ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage cycled through the hills, swimming in murky waters and down the hills while being attacked by bees. Still, his suit was always in a hurry and his shirt a flawless white very last scene. <br /> <br /> Even though it was a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the acting was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. Do not they receive a copy of the script first. If you still want to see the movie, wait until it comes out on DVD.
