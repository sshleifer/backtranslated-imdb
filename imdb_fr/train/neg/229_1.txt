I was surprised by the IFC yesterday and I can not believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one to think that these "ladies" were anything but? Kate tells Jed that she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but she's withdrawing! Can they suddenly decide that they are in love? And she is so devastated by her death, she does not go to her funeral, much less, announces the "good news" to her family! By the way, how did an American become the director of a very good British school? Janine should have been expelled from the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up screwing up a scammer she brought for interrogation! And the less we talk about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> Regarding the guilt that Janine and Molly feel towards Jed, please! It's the fault of punk, it has been turned into roadkill! Where is the guilt vis-Ã -vis poor Gerald, who is vomited? If only I could do the same thing with the bozos behind this "movie"!
