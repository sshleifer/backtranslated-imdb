It is difficult to describe this film and we want to try not to reject it too quickly because it seems that this film could be the perfect film for a 12-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> This film has a beautiful concept - the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It contains rather dreamy images and pretty drawings of the relationship between a young boy, his working single mother and his classmate ... a good start, one would say, but it became a bit greedy, very greedy, he was trying to be a science fiction, drama, thriller, possible romance romantic story, fairy tale, comedy and everything under the sun. The result has just left the public feeling rather inadequate. For example, the scene where the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke up with her kiss (Yuki Kohara) kissing, instead of being romantic, she tries to be scary to make us laugh after .. It's a cheap trick, because it spoils all the anticipation and emotion he was trying to build for the better half of the film. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story on which the film is based (this is the work well known by cartoonist Osamu Tezuka is famous for his intriguing and complex stories) I wonder if all the problems exist in the original story or did it occur during the adaptation? It's quite illogical, even for someone who is used to the "capricious logic" of this Japanese comic book. For example, how did Yuki Kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant (even though it involves a long bus ride) to flee Risa Goto's character in front of the TV cameras right after to have seen it live on his TV interview? <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that are directly copied (not very creative!) other films and that all seem rather boring, for example. the famous scene "the mouth of the lion has my hand" of the film "the" Roman festival "<br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing ... it is not a fairy tale of fairy and did not have enough jokes to be a comedy ... and strangely, there are scenes that even seem to be an unintentional "ghost" movie, but we must pay tribute to him for having managed to capture part of the feeling of the Japanese teenager. <br /> <br /> It is while watching this film that I feel that some films should have come with a warning label stating that "this film could only suitable for a person under 18 ", this would definitely have been on the poster of this film. <br /> <br />
