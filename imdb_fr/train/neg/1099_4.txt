I was shocked by the ridiculously incredible plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal fantasy of what the army should be. The dialogue was hard to swallow as well as the silly things his senior officers left to Colin Farrell's character. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason why the training camp is tough, it's supposed to put the soldiers in combat and turn them into a coherent unit. There is no room for arrogant attitudes and men who will not follow orders. "I was motivating Bozz to get his butt kicked because it was so dangerous for his fellow soldiers. I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in the war because he was more concerned about people's feelings than about what it was necessary to do to protect his unit. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
