It's an extremely stupid and little-seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it features Puddy from the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this artificial film and he is remarkably slimmer here. Oliver Reed was first, but he's just a part of the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it is amusing to see all the young and excited brides of wealthy old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the role of a brothel owner and it's so much nudity in the movie. If they are not drunken orgies at the brothel, it is the young women who have it in their turn. Then, of course, towards the end, the slaves revolt and the bloody confrontation. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another way invented to advance the story. Incredibly they did a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! I hope they were well paid because this first film is pretty bad. Nudity makes it visible and Warburton's lack of accent makes it sometimes laughable. Very bad movie but I must admit that I want to see more.
