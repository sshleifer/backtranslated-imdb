Band Camp was awful, The Naked Mile was a bit better, and this third DVD sequel in the American Pie franchise seems to have the same quality as its predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity. Today, he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join Erik's cousin, Dwight (Steve Talley), at the university. With the promise of many parties, lots of alcohol and enough hot girls at the Beta House, they have only fifty tasks to accomplish to become official privileged members. GEK ("Geek") House, led by the power-hungry nerd (and the sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), offers bigger and better than Beta offers. To settle it once and for all, Beta and Gek fight against the banned group, for forty years, the Greek games to fight, the loser being eliminated. The latest champion of the games, Noah Levenstein, aka Jim's Dad (the only regular of Eugene Levy), directs the show, which sees the people detach bras, a duel of gladiators floating on the water, catch a greased pig , a Russian roulette in the mouth with cartouches of old horse sperm, woman carrying and drinking a barrel full of alcohol (with non-disqualifying vomiting). All this comes to sudden death, with a guy doing stripper rides, and they have to resist the fuck, Beta House wins when Edgar enjoys with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. In addition, Christopher McDonald of Flubber as Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is very slightly increased, as is the rudeness of the jokes, and I guess it's rated one out of every five stars, but I like it. Adequate!
