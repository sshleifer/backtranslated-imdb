It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have studied the subject mainly out of morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I had not done it. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, but I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I would like to have. He neglects the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the film manages to redeem itself in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it under any circumstances. It's an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. As many people say, I do not think "The Bell Jar" is necessarily infiltrable, but this restitution could have been achieved without. I would almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice.
