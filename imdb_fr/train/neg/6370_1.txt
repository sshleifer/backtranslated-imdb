For some reason, TV Guide has awarded this star two and a half stars plus Faye Dunaway, making it a must see site. My, oh, my, it's maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Already. From her horrible acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, I scream on TV: "I can not play!" When she asks him what he needs, I scream : "I need play lessons!" Dialogue ("Give me back my organs!"). <br /> <br /> And the expected end of Brian DePalma, too, was just terrible. Dunaway is one of the best actors of all time and the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But wowzers, that made me laugh, laugh, most of the time. br /> <br /> Do not worry even out of curiosity, This was my first mistake, staying my second, third and fourth.
