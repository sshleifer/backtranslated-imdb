I watched the movie recently and it does not look like the book. I blame this on a mediocre scenario and direction. Some pieces were forced into the scene (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. In fact, I read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and a bit awkward. Too many disparate ideas introduced without any benefit ... other than sensational parts for the moment. As it covers things considered "sensitive", to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination that it produced at the time. This is no longer the case however or maybe I see things differently now or a little bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, the result being a mixture of scenes that can make sense to the person reading the book. Still, this is a hard-to-see movie that may never have been done.
