Cavemen was by far the biggest crappy load I lost time watching. This show based on Geico's commercials is less fun than a 30-second commercial for Geico. The makeup was half ass-ed to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth, even after going to the dentist. This show may well have potential for a fun series if they could get the casting of commercials, which in itself would make an ugly show. Maybe if the authors were identical to the Geico ads, that might be a chance, but the pilot lacked a good script. I give this show a 1 in 10, I would like to put a zero on 10, but it was not an option. I pray for a quick death of this show, I would give him less than 5 episodes before his death is deserved.
