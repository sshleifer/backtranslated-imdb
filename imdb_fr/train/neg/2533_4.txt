I agree with most, if not all Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com) of the previous commentator. The Zatoichi series is an excellent study of character combined with great sword fights and great excitement. <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 was not released on Zone 1 (United States). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The scenario was complicated and seemed to be a mix of many previous Zatoichi stories. At one point, I wondered if I did not see a remake of a previous film of Zatoichi. <br /> <br /> This film was disappointing because it was beginning to depend on effects (head rolled, limbs cut, blood) and less on the nobility of the character of Zatoichi. All the previous films were successful on the basis of the script and the action, and conquered a large number of spectators without having to resort to effects. <br /> <br /> I only hope that the remaining Zatoichi films will NOT follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I highly recommend all previous Zatoichi movies - and recommend them.
