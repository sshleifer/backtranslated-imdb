I suppose it would be an excellent film for a true supporter of organized Christian dogma, but for all those who are open-minded, who believe in free will, rational thought, the separation of Church & State and GOOD science fiction, it's a terrible joke! There are known actors who either had an urgent need to work, or a need to share their personal convictions with other pagans. <br /> <br /> I had fun about it movie in the same way I was entertained by "Reefer Madness". This film has tried to teach drug education through alarmist tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach the "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It made me scream with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people really believe that our society should go back to the good old days of the 19th century!
