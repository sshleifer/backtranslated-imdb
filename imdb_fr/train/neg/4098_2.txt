Although it is "better" than the first Mulva (who does not say much anyway, I would rather watch the paint dry), it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything of these Low Budget Pictures guys. I was persuaded to buy some DVDs to support independent filmmakers and I regret it. Some have not even been officially released yet (not bootlegs bought by the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even say how bad they are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them, as they appear in other small independent movies with which they are friends. If you're friends of these guys, chances are you're in their movies and have fun making them. But for those who had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad sound, bad acting, bad plot, etc., etc. They are not even funny. I gave it a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is there and that's about it. Maybe it does not even deserve the 2. About a star on 1 1 / 16th to show that it was slightly better than the first (which I would have liked to be able to note in the negatives). If you want a decent film without a budget, go get something from LBP's "friends" at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. These are really decent.
