There are a lot of good things in the new GSO: there are multiple Cylon roles for the 8 and 6 models, for example, that both actresses have superbly played. There is the old school of industrial design aboard Galactica ("My ship will not be networked, on my corpse!"). In addition, all space battles, special effects (though the veteran sci-fi observer will recognize the cartoon characters Darkness of the characters, their essentially imperfect nature. <br /> <br /> This is as bitter as the end was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the raid on the Cylons and all that was very good But the end confused? I always watch movies and shows these days with the hidden timer, so I never know how much time is left before the end, so for me it was a particular type of torture, see the end being repeated over and over again, every time I thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, I have one more, and every frakking character has a complete ending, it was not really necessary. > <br /> What really showcased the amateur amateur schoolchildren: the scenes of the young Roslin.Why is it Is it important for us to know that {a} she lost her sisters and her father in a horrible accident and {b} holding an overnight interview with a former student? What does this bring to the story? Where was the link? Now, I'm all for a more European-style approach, and random acts of madness in movies and shows, etc., but it was just ridiculous. This brings nothing significant to the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw the "Last Edition of Frakkin" in which Ron revealed his own ignorance of the plot: he could not find a solution. a good ending for the story, so .... he did not do it! It's never as much about the characters as the last episode. The whole idea "it goes back thousands of years in the past," the idea of ​​mitochondrial Eve, was also used in the Galaxy Hitchhiker's Guide, and believe me, many observers of BSG know this particular story of H2G2. And speaking of Hera, there is now a scenario that has NOT been worked well. Instead, Roslin makes his former student who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. The most power for them. But that ... just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In the end, this series is as imperfect as its characters would like. It goes even more for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 are better with their finals.
