I saw this movie when I was really small. This is by far one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Now, normally, I like strange movies, but it was a bit too much. <br /> <br /> The plot is not big. It all starts with Toy Story, where the toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to save their new friend, Babette. From there, madness ensues. There are the Greedy, the Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks and a group of pirates who sing the tunes of TV series, which makes the film even stranger. In addition, I can not help but think that Babette is annoying and a little too moaning. She certainly did not help the film. <br /> <br /> Now, even though I did not like this movie, there were some cute parties. I liked the song of the camel. Even though it was a song about loneliness, it was a friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most Looneys were just crazy, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little backpack that gave Dr. Evil a real bad guy. In addition, there was Andy Raggedy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was really a good song for little boys who wanted to be tough. But honestly, even those things did not improve the movie. (But remember, this is just my point of view.) <br /> <br /> Even though personally, I would not recommend this movie, even if I have to admit it, it has its lovely moments. See if it interests you, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
