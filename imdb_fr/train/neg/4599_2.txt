The proverb "Never judge a book by its cover" was coined as a warning to those who fail to look below the surface. <br /> <br /> While I was watching the drawing, "The king of the ants", I immediately told myself HORROR! The mysterious images displayed proudly on the cover and back evoked a dark vision. The synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and revenge. Instead, what I discovered beneath this surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. <br /> <br /> "The King of Ants" introduces Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an ordinary guy who is ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it is 'a murder. Except that Sean Crawley is someone you do not care about, never once did I feel compassion or sympathy for that character. In fact, it is downright unlikely, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who interprets an uninspired performance as a spectacle made even worse by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. Add Kari Wuhrer as a widow in mourning who apparently has unconditional trust (especially in the homeless) and little or no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, who is basically a sober standard of Cheers but ME Mean! <br /> <Now, there are some interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images), but this film never goes deeper into this world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue and unlikely event after improbable event. Oh horror!
