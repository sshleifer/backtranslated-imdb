The DVD was a joke, the audio of the first minutes was terrible with a desynchronized sound and the voice of Segals was not even his! Pathetic! When the audio sync was better after about 5 minutes, the plot, lines, and actors had to move to another position because the movie business is not where it should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had good films in the film the first few days, the last ones are a joke and should annoy him, as well as the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Segal were the one to deal with it, it would be better for another party to lead the show, because he has no talent in this area. <br /> <br /> This film is a total embarrassment for all those involved in its production and a shame for all who watched it. I turned it off after about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask for my money back to Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
