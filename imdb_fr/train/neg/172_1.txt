Back to Cabin at the lake does not resist in any case to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the escrow, the movie is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the story and the acting were really good, but it's a movie I will never watch again. It is basically equal to what the suites of Urban Legends and Blair Witch were, but with a much worse acting game. I have personally seen better acting in soap operas, it's so pitiful that you have to laugh. In any case, I do not recommend this film to anyone, watching it will hurt the first.
