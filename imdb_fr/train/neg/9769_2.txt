I read that Thornton Wilder played last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation on the screen. Let me tell you that this is not a fantastic game, it is easily overwhelmed, but it deserves a much better shot. The actor's play was really lacking, the landscape, honest to God, looked like it had been designed in cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if that could not get worse, the sound quality is mediocre ... there is this "buzz" that numbs every time an actor speaks ... Well, is nonexistent. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is black and white, which would be nice, but it brings out even more cheesiness. In any case, I think that if you want to see this film, which I do not really recommend, do not aim for your hopes. The piece, as faithful as it is, is probably better.
