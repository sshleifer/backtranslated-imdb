Western society has been nourished by ideas that India is a poor country. Films like these only reinforce these beliefs. Such illustrations make the acceptance of Indians abroad all the more difficult. I agree that there are poor and homeless people in India, but why is there no representation of educated people other than those who have succeeded? <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the movie featuring Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion, this film showed India in a very bad light by giving false notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. That's exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right in front of the airport so we do not have to walk on roads so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should look at "Wedding at the Monsoon".
