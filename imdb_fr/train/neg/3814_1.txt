I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling a family show is ridiculous. I am amazed at how much we remember after all these years. This is an extremely stupid and stupid show about a widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid school friend, and others over the seasons. All lines of the plot usually have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else and each episode is invented and ends with a slight joke. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unpleasant as a father of the mother's responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a 30-year-old joke that makes cartoons and behaves like a kid, and it's horrible. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but he was so cliche that it was hard to watch. The oldest girl, DJ, was a real actress and showed no emotion. Stephanie, the girl in the middle, was too cliched as the annoying little sister. The youngest of the girls, Michelle, showed what was the bad actress of the Olsen twins. You can always know when they turn them off. The intrigues of too many stories were so stupid that it is worth it. This is a "family" show that has tried to replace any good substance with kindness and love. Although these are necessary for a show about a family, they have done too much. It will be remembered as my favorite sit-com of the '80s and' 90s. <br /> <br /> My note: Terrible show. TVG 30 minutes
