The images are beautiful and reflect the landscapes of Canada. The story was, on the other hand, rather boring; In my eyes, it was a love story in the woods, just like Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not think Gray Owl was an excellent environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
