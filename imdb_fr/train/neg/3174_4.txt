Jeff Lowell wrote badly and directed 'Over Her Dead Body'. The idea is first, is as bland as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker There is almost nothing interesting in this film. Eva is still beautiful and offers a remarkable performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks jaded and the least interested. Lake Bell is a total mistake. She looks manly and offers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is lost, as is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more entertainment with this movie. Unfortunately, I did not have fun.
