What a horrible movie. I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this recreation. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer played in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is awesome in E.R. and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel bad for them. The background music, I must say, did not fit the story and it's amazing how to find those directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced film. I hope that in the future, no director as horrible as this one could ever lose such a great classic film. This film should not have been done in the first place. A tip to all who have seen it, please tell me that I am right, because I could not be the only spectator not to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 of 10.
