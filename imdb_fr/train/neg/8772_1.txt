There is nothing new to say: 4 hours of people dying constantly in the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / publisher / God has gaffed. He should have eaten a modest pie (if not for his own sake, but for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of those brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real publisher, hired a musician somehow so (and who seemed to have listened to a bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on a cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional crew, threw out all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, like the bigwigs of the Indian army, he made terrible decisions for his actors and his audience. We are all dead several times. <br /> <br /> Please do not do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha Regiment, I suggest hiring more than one Nepali to represent the team. There are surely many Nepali men working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
