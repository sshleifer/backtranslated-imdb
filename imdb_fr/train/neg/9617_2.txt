Three years ago, Rachel (Thérèse Fretwell) was celebrating at the lake with her friends when her brother fell from a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop beating herself up and blame for something she has no control over. So grab the beer and something to chew and head to the same lake that has been in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already begun when two friends are splashed before even going to the party. This film has the feeling of a play in high school where everyone has forgotten his lines and "winged" ... very badly! Writer Marcos Gabriel has the most fleshy role of Rachel's boyfriend, Leo. Apart from Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty actresses and some characters you'd like to choke out before they're "offended". Draw attention to a few other players who have had the nerve to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a memorable day you would like to miss.
