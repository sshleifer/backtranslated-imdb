Enough is enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making movies based on a long-dead concept. The first Tremors movie was awesome. The second was ridiculous. The third was nauseating. The television series was terribly awful. And this film only pushes the issue deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically, another excuse for computer effects and cheap puppets. We now have the series in the Wild West, in the nineteenth century, and they are fighting graboids. As in the case of the first, they must learn to beat them again. Slightly entertaining I suppose. Otherwise, this video version, like Tremors 2 and 3, goes way too far. Oh and I keep wondering how there have ever been any traces of these events ... have they just forgotten to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be a story, so our friends in the first movie would not be so badly prepared. <br /> <br /> Films like this that ruin the original make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
