Despite the rave reviews that this film has generated in New Zealand, all the hype surrounding the production is unfortunately badly deserved. Apart from a plot reserved for clichés, the film is disappointing due to weak actors, accents and a general lack of tension. <br /> <br /> While having the appearance of a big budget (for New Zealand), the sensation is definitely a small Kiwi town ... <br /> <br /> Is it someone did not see The Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who will choose the similarities immediately ... I heard that scenes like those boys playing basketball, etc., had been filmed to make fun of the clichés "boys talking" shit, but that seems to be forced ... <br /> <br /> I think Oscar Keightley considers himself deeply ironic, but again, his presentation always seems simply vaguely self-aware. <br /> <br /> Those who still have doubts about the fact that the culture of Samoans living in New Zealand has been deeply, hopefully, not permanently , affected by the discourse, culture and all American culture, and that everything in between will certainly have his opinion taken at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Robbie magazine has always a beautiful appearance on the screen, but the script lowers it. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me in the wrong meaning when a "comedy" has scenes so obviously configured, you feel as if you had a good moan at the line of typing - see you want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this hilarious e, however, this person has the brain of a tadpole and would have trouble spelling his name if he was offered a million dollars .... <br /> < This summarizes a little the mentality of this film, OK but not great, fun but not funny ... Wake up in New Zealand - This is not a 5 star movie despite all the glimmer (guilt White of the middle class?) :-)) Critics .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you look at it, drank first !!!
