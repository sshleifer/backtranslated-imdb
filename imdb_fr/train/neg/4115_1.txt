"Power Play" starts interestingly, but it goes down quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small role. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California in a year. The scene of the earthquake in the mall is so artificial and completely incredible. And all the scenes of action look like a group of third-year students staging a play. It's awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, if "Power Play" was created in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a bad movie of class "B". The fact that "Power Play" was created in 2001 is really sad. Is there a class "D" movie? If so, "Power Play" launches the mold.
