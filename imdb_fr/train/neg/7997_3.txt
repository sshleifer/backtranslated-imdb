Even for a tired movie model like the nature / man cycle that prevailed predominantly in the 1970s, ants are far from effective (though they are fun for reasons that it was not intended to make). It's so ridiculous. Apparently, these bulldozed ants near an inn have been eating toxic waste for decades and have adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of them deadly. To watch actors of a certain notoriety falling awkwardly in the middle of tiny black dots is painfully funny, not so good but very bad. So many scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers shrieking in horror while lying in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through bits of wallpaper, Bernie Casey feigning a leg of gam the list goes on and on. The dangers presented range from ants that crawl from a black ant drain to all walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seems to believe in the matter. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair during this horror. I hope she found a good use for the money because it is obvious that this was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although this is a very bad film, it is watchable - once for me, and has many of those bad qualities of the seventies - overflowing actors who get in the way, this TV sensation, and the dreaded creatures of nature who take revenge on man. This time, the man has to push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected. Really terrible.
