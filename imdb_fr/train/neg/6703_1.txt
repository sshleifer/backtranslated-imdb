I noticed that this movie has suffered many insults. It was probably worth a part, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film could work very well. I just think that the filmmakers have misjudged the path to take to do that (they should have added more fun elements if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a good movie. But as a satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene does not make sense in the story. Still, it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it in the top 10 worst? It's debatable.
