A great slasher movie - a pity that it is the producers and not the script. Basic plot summary - a man with a red fetish will invite such women into his apartment and then enter into a kind of weird coma and proceeds by offering them varying degrees of success. Only the behind-the-scenes editing team must have thought the movie was as advertising as me and cut it into pieces. Nothing flows, we get lost on what red hair he is at that moment (he did not care sooner ??), and most of the time, it seems that the cameraman fainted and took over filming when he wakes up. Not that I can blame him, I fainted 2 or 3 times and I had to rewind and resume to try to recover the little plot that exists. Warning when you see the end DO NOT try to connect it to anything that's happening before - you'll just have an aneurysm. Not worth the time, the effort, or that God protects us from money. The only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slight chance that piracy will occur between the release of the movie and the horrible version I watched.
