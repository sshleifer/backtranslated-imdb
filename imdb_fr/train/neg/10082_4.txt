I laughed all through this rotten movie. It's so amazing. A woman leaves her husband after several years of marriage and breaks down in front of a real estate agency. What happens? The head of office goes out and offers him a job !!! Hilarious! The next thing you know, the two women go there. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing sounds right in this movie "For life for women with nothing better to do". Clumsy dialogues such as "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I have a chance to be happy and did not take it" do not help. There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A Sassy Dark Housekeeper - amazing that in 2003, a film was shot in which a sassy dark-room maid appeared. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who panics and wants custody of teenage children. Sheesh! No clich√© is left unprepared.
