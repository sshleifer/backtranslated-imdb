I live in Ottawa where this film was shot and I really wish it had not happened. It's a horrible film. I really try to support independent films but there is this stigma attached to something indie and this stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to ward off this curse. Actor, screenwriter and director Brett Kelly contributes little to the genre. He rather rediffuses clich√©s tired of the past. I'm really tired of threatening evil characters who hide in the shadows and attack the disturbing, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I remember one particular scene near the end of the film, where the whole scene is lit by car headlights. Some might say that it was an effect used to create an atmosphere and a tension, but unfortunately, it was to show the minimal budget of this film. Similarly, for a film that dares to be called horror, a spectator will be in a difficult situation to find a gore, except for a few scenes with corn syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br /> What mainly holds this film is the pace and lack of character development, the basic plot is that the kids are kidnapped and the parents have to find this comrade Bonesetter before a while in order to get their children back. Not that this concept bothers me, but I did not really believe that when the two main characters, the two who lost children can find the time to face each other. This is done in such a short time that it is inconceivable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the woman before meeting us. <br /> <br /> The last point I have to say is .... and I will not get back to Kelly, but the whole movie is shot on a boring, unemotional video, which really distances all the moments of tension that would have just oozed the style on the film. Although this film had been redone to a million dollars and made history again and the game boring and lame theater, all could not maintain this film afloat. My only hope is that something prevents Brett Kelly from doing a sequel, which was reported on his website, a sequel that was half written in one sitting. <br /> <br /> Lord, help us all.
