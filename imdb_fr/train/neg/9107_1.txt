I was angry that anyone made this movie. I was even more angry, I lost precious minutes of my life, still, watching this. I could have had a wax job and be more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a little confused at first, but I understood and understood what was happening. At that time, the film was halfway through, and yes I am a procrastinator but I still want to see things through. So I stuck it, I looked at everything. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, they are simply not convincing. I saw my nephew calling the attention more convincingly than the supposed desire described on the screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad play, look at this.
