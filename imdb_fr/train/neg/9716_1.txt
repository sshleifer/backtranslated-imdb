This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is full of holes, the story looks like a bad remake of a bad movie suspense and its actors seem to read directly from the manuscript for the first time. Steve Guttenberg is the worst of all. He embodies his character as in "Police Academy" - the same female idiot - and that does not suit a prominent man in what should have been a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson does "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague ...
