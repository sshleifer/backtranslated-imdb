How this movie gets a rating of 6.7 is amazing. It deserves nothing better than 2.0 and should clearly rank among the 100 worst films of all time for IMDb. The National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and has just been a new assault imposed on the American public by Hollywood. Critics said that it was possible to run a 16-wheel vehicle. <br /> <br /> I like the reasons why this movie is good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on people, no wonder people in the world think Americans are stupid. This must be the most stupid and insulting movie I have ever seen. If you want to see a really decent movie this season, think of Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The National Treasure unfortunately had a lot more publicity than these great films. I bet most people who read this have not even heard of them because some have not been widely broadcast yet. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - in good movies. Time and time again, I have seen Cage squander his tremendous talent in such dreadful, numbing movies as Con Air, The Rock, and Face-Off. When his talent is put to use, as in Charlie Kaufman's adaptation, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> Result - I prefer to give my hand to a wood chipper than to undergo this visual atrocity again.
