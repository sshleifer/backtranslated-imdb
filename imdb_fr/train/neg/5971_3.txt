A friend of mine told me that this movie was a cute story. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back, because I could have done SO MUCH more productive things with my time ... like, for example, turning my thumbs. I see absolutely nothing to buy about this film, apart from its playful aspect ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and it's generous)
