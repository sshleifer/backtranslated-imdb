I have a weakness for this Kari girl for a while, and in terms of her appearance in this film, nothing to complain about. But after seeing it last night in high definition, I'm sure: it's the only thing in the film that is not substandard. The scenario is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad, you can just turn it into softcore porn, but instead, I can see a pasty white guy stopping me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that do not offer me anything, except teasing. They should have just gone to the movies so that the movie would not be a waste of time, but no. With such a horrible scenario, they should have capitalized on the look of Wuhrer, since it is the only pro of the film. 2/10, just because she looked so hot.
