Just Cause is one of those films that, at first, leaves a lot to wonder why it was so heavily advertised when it was released - nothing special, but quite competent and supported by Ed Harris. Then you reach the last third and everything starts to get more and more stupid until you get a killer with a flashlight hanging on the threatening forehead to put Sean Connery's wife in a net (a Kate Kate usually very handy and unconvincing) and a child (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner hut. <br /> <br /> The kind of film that we probably see best in an airplane, and even then only once.
