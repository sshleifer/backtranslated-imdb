I really wanted to love this film because the critics were cruel <br /> <br /> to say it ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. <br /> <br /> misbehaved, a meaningless scenario, a sensible direction ... Watching this movie was like <br /> <br /> watching a car accident, you want to look away but you keep going to watch <br /> <br /> because you want to see how much it will become messy. Well, the car is <br /> <br /> in ruins and there are no survivors. On the positive side, the film <br /> <br /> was nice, made me want to go on vacation, if only to cleanse me of <br /> <br /> this hell
