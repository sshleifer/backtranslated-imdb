I will say that at least the film makes sense, but it's bad. Playing most of the time is not good (I think only Sky has promised) and you feel bad about listening to it. All the scenes that should make sense are really superficial, like when Ng comes to see his parents. There are a lot of tacky details, like the kanji tattoo on the shoulder of the Sky, the magnets on the fridge of the girls and the horrible decor on the sets ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and all. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point "I'm gay, not nerdy." And not aware. Even the comment is awful, I turned it off after Ng recounted how weird it was to play a lesbian.
