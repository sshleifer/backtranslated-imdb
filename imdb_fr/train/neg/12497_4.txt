I'm sure the people at the border between Texas and Louisiana had a good laugh when the unit photos B Paramount inflicted it to the public in times of war. Quite simply, the region of the Sabine River where the film begins is a cotton country, just like the rest of the Great South or at least the Great South, the post-civil war. There is no cattle empire, they are much further west in Texas, further than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could not climb to establish their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with their partner in a river boat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services by not paying for the transportation of cattle, they keep it. And it's the beginning of the big ranch they start like Ponderosa. <br /> <br /> On the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, incarnated by Frances Gifford, and quarrels with her much smaller neighbors. They also have more in-depth contact with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Easterners who love Westerners are not usually bored with geographical trifles. these Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount. The highlight is an outbreak, and I mean literally, a battle cannon that might have been used in a production A. But I do not want that Western fans watch it.
