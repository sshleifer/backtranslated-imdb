This film is a shame for the franchise of the Major League. I live in Minnesota and even I can not believe they threw Cleveland (Yes, I realize at the time that the real Indians were pretty good and the Twins had taken their place at the bottom of the American League while still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first major league, loved the second and looked forward to the third, when the Indians finally go up to the series. You can not tell me that it was not planned after the end of the second film. What happened? Anyway, if you are a real fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and do not look at these nonsense.
