The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Dunaway Gold (old version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as soon as possible (successfully), do not ask him how is going Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment at this lousy thing. It offers an endless, meaningless dialogue and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful entrance halls with elevators, a Bruce Goff art deco church and a charming Frank Lloyd Wright mansion. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. This does not do justice to the location.
