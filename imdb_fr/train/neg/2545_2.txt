There are laughs in this film, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he was funny (before deciding he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me a lot in this film is how almost all the characters are inimitable. Apart from the two main tracks, everyone is a fool. I mean, these losers in small towns are about as rude as you can get. You just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. In addition, the American factory worker is described as a lazy and ungrateful slob. I wondered if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, of course, in the end, they are all alike, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
