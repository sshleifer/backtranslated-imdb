He is a candidate for the most disappointing film experience of my life. Cool title, excellent director (I've already seen "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before) and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, it's a question that was trotting in my temples for hours after watching this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disjointed and hopeless in an attempt to be shifted, this is the dead zone of a film to avoid at all costs. His critical criticism was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redemptive quality. Zero on ****.
