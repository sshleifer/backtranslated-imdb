I can not really say anything bad * or * good about this thing. His characters are quite friendly, he is skillfully produced and crafted, and of professional quality (with the exception of this nerdy monster costume). However, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing that you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, the cookie cutter, "dark body drones in deep space against unstoppable monsters". Pretty much a waste of time.
