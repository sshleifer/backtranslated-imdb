Daddy's daughters, Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West, receive terrific news at the local post office, not realizing they are stalked by burglar Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from the young Robert Harron) requiring Daddy to leave the house; so when young women come back, they can be ?? alone at home. As the vulnerable couple goes to bed for the evening, the local Grand Ball begins; and, a dark-skinned drinker portends additional danger for D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his best roles in Biograph, stealing the movie from "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-eyed extras at Black and Tans. "Biograph Girls", Lawrence and West later suggested the "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, notably in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and, they are excessively affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate because the story of a burglar bought back by saving his potential victims from greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dad (01/02/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
