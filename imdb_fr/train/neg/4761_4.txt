Harold Pinter rewrote Anthony Schaeffer's classic play about a man who will visit his lover's husband and who will do everything wrong. The original film featured Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has the role of Olivier in this version and is associated with Jude Law. The film is made here by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The acting is spectacular. Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like chemistry and the shock of personalities. It's wonderful and enough reason to watch when the direction of the script goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is sharp and often very spiritual. I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the room (which is updated using surveillance cameras, etc.). The problem is that the way the script moves the characters is horrible. Michale Caine walks Law in her strange modern house with sliding doors and panels for no good reason. Conversations take place several times in different places. I know that Pinter did it in his pieces, but in this case, it becomes tedious. Why do we need the couple to constantly repeat that Law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be nice if, at some point, Law said enough that we did that, but he does not do it, he acts as if it's the first time. The scenario did not upset Caine in his handling of Law either. For starters, he is blindly angry, so he has no chance to turn around and scare us. (Never mind a late revelation in the game that makes you think of the reason why it was bothered). we are there and although it gives us an advantage, it also seems false to us, because it is so clear that we are forced to ask ourselves why Law's Milo does not see that it is being set up. There are some other cases, but to say more, it would be too much to give. <br /> <br /> Thinking of the movie in hindsight, I think it's a movie of missed opportunities and missteps. The lost opportunities are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law. The faux pas in the sense that the choice of a screaming scenery and strange scenario changes mitigate the creation of a tension and a credible thriller. Instead, we get some intelligent dialogue and excellent performance in a movie that does not leave them real. <br /> <br /> despite some great performances and a witty dialogue, it's only a 4 out of 10, because the rest of the script does not work
