Personally, I found this film appalling. It was primarily a non-objective objective, which provided a part of the debate. The only people who were presented as on the side claiming that it existed were a group of people from a Billy Grahm Revival. Secondly, Jesus (Yeshua) existed very differently from the violence of Christianity and presented scenes from Mel Gibsons "The Passion". In the end, the director convinces his former conservative private school principal to be interviewed and tries to trap him to teach the faith to the children. Oh, and the techno music just made the movie harder to watch.
