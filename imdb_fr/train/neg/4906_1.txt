Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously, it was a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but everything that happened before or after seemed to be a kind of film in numbers. <br /> <br /> And talk about a bad chemistry between the detectives of the turtles. .. <br /> <br /> I would like to go deeper, but this movie does not really deserve it. Grade: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
