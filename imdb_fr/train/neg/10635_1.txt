It is noted that one of the heroines was raped by Russian soldiers for "drunken rampage", which is completely false. This film should not be shown just because of that. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone who claims that the KGB has pursued "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis". The KGB was looking for so-called "Zionist" agents, who were imperialist agents (according to the KGB). It's totally different from targeting the Jews as a nation, as the Nazis did. Gypsies have never been prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool used politically, but from an internationalist point of view. The Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole film stinks like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the general of the KGB looks totally phony. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are totally invented and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch it - this movie is full of lies and bogus stuff. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
