The word "1st" in the title has a more disturbing meaning for the audience of this film than for its victims. At least they do not have to stay and watch this endless film reach its own demise. <br /> <br /> The first must refer to: the first draft of the scenario; 1st shot used in each performance of the final film; 1st edition in post production; etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The film is not too badly interpreted, is that everything in the film is worse than the third, from the wacky scenario to the performance in wood. And while you suffer through this paved film, after two hours you want to be rid of your misery. After 160 minutes, it is obvious that it should have been changed in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Go into details about the lame scenario and play is useless. Even in the same case, Lake Placid, at least the performances that Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from an extremely low scenario, were sufficiently nuanced to make you laugh at the movie. In 1st to Die, one does not end in mourning only for the time lost waiting to see what will happen after the opening scene of the preparation of the suicide of the leader. <br /> <br /> The editing is so bad that it is never presented to one of the main characters, which I think (I've never been told that quite) is a DA It just appears in a scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene where it is presented to the viewer has been left on the writing floor. And no one realized that a character appearing from nowhere was an unusual ploy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, do not waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we did not have it. But at least we created our own entertainment by commenting on different parts of the film, as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "In the meantime, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
