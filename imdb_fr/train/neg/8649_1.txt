This film fails miserably at all levels. I have an idea, take all the people involved in this film and send them to a hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, they'll all be shot and we'll never have to waste our time again. Did I mention that I had never been so bitter about a bunch of shit at the movies in my life? God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen so serious. I would rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row rather than sit for 10 minutes with this excuse for a movie. If I happen to meet people involved in this film, I will spit in their faces, then I will beat them without any sense. That's my two cents.
