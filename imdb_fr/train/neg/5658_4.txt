"Laugh, Clown Laugh", released in 1928, plays the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and named her Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in circus life and she became an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not forget that Tito, who is now very old, is favored by young Simonetta. Although he is not his biological father, he raised her as a girl. This kind of "fool" factor permeates the whole movie. Tito is competing for Simonetta's affections with the young and handsome 'Comte' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilty for giving up Tito (out of loyalty, no romantic love). The principle of the movie is ridiculous and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito what a stupid idiot he is (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film deserves to be mentioned only by Loretta Young, who had a great career. Although I love Chaney's talent as an actor, this whole movie just seems scary.
