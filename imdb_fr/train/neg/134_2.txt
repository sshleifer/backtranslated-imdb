This film was far from intelligent. It's a theme that rhymes with all the horror movies ever made. Valentine tries ZERO to be original. What is Valentine's Day? It's a group of people who are passing the same lame messages to one another a year ago. There is nothing original about Valentine. <br /> <br /> I have only seen it once, and some of the films that it tore up are here. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there are more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk. could not catch them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of becoming a good movie. How is it that each horror movie has a "surprising" killer, people who do not interest you because their emotions take a different turn each scene. One minute, a nice girl turns into a diabolical B-ch, then she becomes an uncertain woman, and so on her son. Once again, Valentine does not have that. It was as if they were trying to do the PG-13 but were failing, so they left the edition. <br /> <br /> Do not see this scam too inspired, unless you hate and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
