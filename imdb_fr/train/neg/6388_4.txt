The Quay brothers are directors, judging by conventional thinking, should have remained attached to the production of short films. In fact, I really loved their first feature film, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their second year effort, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I totally agree that they do not are not as close as their past genius. Piano Tuner is without a doubt a wonderful movie to watch and often to listen to. Unfortunately, it is extremely painful to sit with its convoluted narrative and its icy rhythm. When reading the plot summary, it looks like a very good story. But the brothers fail miserably to make it live. One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's awful here. A huge bust.
