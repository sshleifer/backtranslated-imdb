I was very disappointed by this 1970 film based on a story by Bernard Malamud. It is essentially a story of possible redemption, racial prejudices and unfulfilled mistrust. <br /> <br /> A black and Jewish angel is sent to help a troubled tailor and his seriously ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and simply refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes it, Fanny improves, but in the end he doubts and Fanny suffers as a result. It would have been great if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny was talking to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully directed the brilliant performance of Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nomination in 1966 "The Shop on Main Street" also directs this film. Kaminska is reduced in the film most of the time in bed and her kindness in her speech does not really reflect the desperate situation she is facing. She continues to call Ruthie, their daughter, who has disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the appearance of the Angel in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confused and the scene where the Angel's girlfriend confronts Belafonte in their apartment is memorable, but all too brief. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
