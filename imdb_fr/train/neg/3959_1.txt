It's not one of those movies, it's one of the biggest pieces of guts I've ever directed, the camera work is trying to be brilliant, but it's really just that it looks like diaries of red shoes, but without sex, the only reason I bought this software was because I wanted to try the dvd. It's the cheapest I could find, probably the worst purchase of my life. composed of endless rehearsals of clips from the first two movies, why would anyone want to make a film as horrible as it is beyond me, if they had really tried to make an original film and failed, I would be nicer in this criticism did they not simply get the rights to reproduce the elements of the first two films, then put them up and repeat them in this film with perhaps less than a third of the original footage, which corresponds to the standards of the students of the film schools; do not buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you have to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER Incredible waste! 0/10 if only the voting system allowed it.
