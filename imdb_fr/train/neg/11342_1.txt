I should explain why I gave this "work of art" a star out of 10 possible. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to evaluate it without bias. It would probably have been the same if I had given him 10/10 - explanations would have followed anyway. <br /> <br /> I'm not fond of these useless movies and gores like HOSTEL or other - I think it's disgusting and pretty terrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I discovered after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" - and it probably would have been 10/10, because it has a lot and Tarantino would have been more than satisfied (and made Kill Bill 3 pour even more blood on the screen only here to show that it is possible). but the thing about the genre "historical drama" is that it's a subcategory of "waste films" where John Romero is the emperor of the undead-emperor guts and so automatically he can not be categorized as your default movie - these are deliberately poorly crafted movies and you do not really know if the comic moment was supposed to be, or if it was just bad. it's for people who like to enjoy the bad acting, the bad story and everything else. And by a tour of faith, I am one of them too. There are days when I want to see a very bad film, to look for rubbish and voila - the day is won! but it is certainly an opinion which belongs to me and which does not correspond to that of others. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say is that if you want to watch a horrible movie, Casellova de Fellini is definitely the choice. but consider my advice and do not write it down.
