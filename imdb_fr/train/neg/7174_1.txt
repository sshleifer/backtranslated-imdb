I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my comment and the majority decides: This film is bad! From play to unrealistic animation to innumerable mistakes. I was hoping that the shutters would have been lengthened by an effort of imagination (we can not extend the shutters without engine). The landing gear can only be lowered if you have electricity. This tiny fan running was by no means sufficient to lower the landing gear. The only thing I found strange was when they landed, the rear wheels landed and the nose broke, suspending the plane with both tires in the air. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes on tires that did not touch the ground? Have they forgotten the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out everything you can about planes before trying a movie "Plan". Sorry for the technical shot, but I give this movie 1/10.
