Let me begin by saying that I completely agree with the basic thesis of the film, that there was probably no historical Jesus and that Christianity is a sham. That said, this film does a very bad job of proving this thesis. This makes good arguments - the gap between the theoretical life of Jesus and the writing of the Gospels, filled only by the writings of Paul, which does not indicate a historical Jesus - and fails to argue convincingly. He makes grand statements without presenting the evidence on which they are based and resolutely ignores the counter-arguments presented by Christian apologists. Intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning. The only Christians we hear in the film are the head of the filmmaker's old school - who behaves like a reasonable and rational person who tries to treat a twit with a flea on his shoulder - and various Christians encountered at random in a car park. I'm sorry, but to reveal that ordinary Christians do not know much about their religion is not overwhelming evidence of Christian fraud. You can also say that Jay Leno has refuted the existence of Michael Dukakis in his Jay-Walking segment. Interviews with experts may be interesting, but the film is full of things, let's be honest, the filmmaker becomes sneaky. In the first five minutes, the film has already confused Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the writers of the series Left Behind with Branch Davidians. And in the end, the film becomes so egocentric that there is no rational argument left, but a furious old Christian attacking the people and places he blames for his spoiled childhood. You know, maybe this movie might have been interesting, but it's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of Jesus, and it's so complacent to dispel any sympathy. It's a Michael Moore film without the humor or cinematic insight associated with a Richard Dawkins book without mind or intellectual rigor. Jump.
