My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> It puzzles me to think that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would create a movement like the "new wave". Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and intelligent philosophy. But as soon as you hand them a camera, they begin to behave like WOOOHOOO LOOK: WHEN I CAN BE! GROUND? THEME? POOH! SHOW US ON A PARK OF FUN! At least, it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of people's heads - oh, who's that artist). No, Truffaut maintains a certain degree of visual clarity. But the security camera in a quickie-mart does the same. Both are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just like a side for all the school movie crazies: I bet the vein gushes from the side of your neck right now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my report. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you will HOLD it. People who love this movie have probably never read any book besides the rumors of Jack Kerouac or perhaps the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they've read the lyrics of The Doors songs and think it's deeply moving. All that floats your boat. I find it ironic that this film injects (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the most important and significant writers who ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you are not near the stadium. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a syringe infected with AIDS. <br /> <br /> If you are the type to think of yourself, stick to the Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, have fun with Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for Pete's sake, push that vein back into your neck. You look like a cabbage.
