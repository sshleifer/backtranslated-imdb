This movie was not great but it was not very good. I'm a big fan Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins about Robin Williams, writer and who wrote a 14-year-old kid's book. The book is excellent and he can not believe that a child has written it. Toni Collette plays the guardian of the children that you do not know if this child really exists or if it invents everything. I will not spoil the film, but I will say that the film is not scary. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good and the performance of Toni Collette was amazing, as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge disappointment. In my opinion, I would wait for him to come on DVD.
