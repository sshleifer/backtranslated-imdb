Ok, let me write a new word here: polyphobia: the fear of polyamorous relationships. This is another example in a long series of films that start by moving the audience about a kind of three-part plan, then launching a soap opera and claiming how much it is so necessary and the only moral thing to find a solution monogamous. One in a thousand people understand the pleasure of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in a few decades, polyphobia will be a false step as heavy as homophobia, but guess who was too narrow-minded to realize it? Okay the first time: the producers of this movie. And many like that. Why even make a kind of ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned movie like this? Proud to be open to the gay spirit to the infinite, he completely forgets the fact that we live in a time when monogamy turns into sequential monogamy, which in turn turns into swing and polyamour. Open your eyes, please, people! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing and banal chick film. (But damn it, I must say that Heather Graham is the cutest thing in the world.) 3 of 10
