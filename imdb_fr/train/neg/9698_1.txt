There are many extremely talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of them are associated with this "film". <br /> <br /> Why are producers in the world really investing in something like this? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this trash! It's not fun to have seven adult men running like dwarves pretending to be funny. What's funny is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest in the band) plays the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments that scream at legends saying supposed to laugh now! It's hard to believe that this shit is supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people got up and left the cinema after 30 minutes of film. I should have done the same thing instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
