Too Much Borrowed Grade B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in a movie theater. For this reason, movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budget movies this weekend. Every two or three years, a studio publishes a film featuring a counter-programmed woman ("The Wedding Planner" of 2001) in order to compete with the big game. This weekend of the Super Bowl, entitled "The Wedding Date" will also try to find success and attract viewers who do not watch the game. <br /> <br /> Sick of anyone sorry for her, single woman Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, "Will and Grace" on TV) hired Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt "), who accompanies him boyfriend for the wedding of his sister in London. Her family makes her go through difficult times so that she is not married and her seven-year-old ex-fiancé, who threw her away for no reason, is the best of men. To make him jealous, Kat scrolls Nick around his ex to show him what he misses. But finally, Nick helps Kat understand that she can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The film borrows too much from similar wedding films. It's almost an exact copy of "Picture Perfect" from 1999 and mixes scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has an inverted theme "Pretty Women" and, knowing its audience, the director makes intelligent references to this film and other films. <br /> <br /> "The date of the wedding" contains all the clichés of a typical wedding film, there is the dominant stereotypical mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and practically plagiarized wedding speeches of family and friends at the wedding dinner and rehearsal. The twist in the end was done before, but it was something that was not fully expected. The real reason why Kat was dropped is a surprise and changes the direction of the film in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Even if "The wedding date" is predictable, it is able to remain autonomous. Debra Messing, in her first lead role, proves that she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogues were too tacky and unrealistic. He is able to make the most of what is given to him and save the character. <br /> <br /> By using many intelligent word games (often sexual), the movie is really fun. Although the film is primarily a female film, everyone can enjoy it. Good history and humor make it the best date film ever released.
