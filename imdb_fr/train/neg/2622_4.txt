102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Cruella to be cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and is preparing for a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella who is helping homeless street dogs. When Big Ben rings, things go wrong. The hypnotic healing is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that polka-dot coat she's always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close takes on the role of Cruella de Vil and is once again the highlight of the film. Each scene with her is worth watching in this sad sequel, which looks more like a rehearsal of the previous movie than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
