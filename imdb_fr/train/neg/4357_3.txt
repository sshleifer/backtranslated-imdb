A group of friends are face to face with a family of hideous cannibals as they camp in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of "family of mutant cannibals" is almost as old as the hills that the bloody consanguine often calls home, so any director who tries to breathe new life into the genre must come up with something special enough to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give a Teutonic twist to the well-maintained routine, transplanting the action in the Black Forest and giving it the low-budget German splash-proof treatment. The result is a bloody effort, but quite unoriginal, made almost unassailable thanks to the terrible decisions of the management - in particular, the non-stop use of sophisticated filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> Had Timo Rose did not use all the tricks offered by her editing software, so Barricade could have been a pretty entertaining festival: her inexperienced actors are doing pretty well; bloody effects are appropriate for stomach ache; and there are one or two fears and even scary moments well designed. All this, however, is completely ruined by the horrible camera work, the hectic editing and the crushing barrage of visual gadgets used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular among today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 just for the weird gore, which includes a clever scene in which a guy is forced to drink acid, tons of nauseating wounds caused by a variety of sharp tools and some pretty decent shotgun damage.
