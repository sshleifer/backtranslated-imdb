This film seemed to be good at first, but never met his expectations. The director is talented and has good shooting angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story that goes with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in all directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable and interesting angle. Basically, the film never matches the explanation of press releases. The acting game was very good, though. All the actors gave good performances and Jude Law was remarkable as it always was. It's a pity he chose to make such a weak film.
