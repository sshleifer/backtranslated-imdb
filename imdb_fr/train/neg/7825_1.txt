I guess this movie is a fitting homage to Superman's first film, as it is as shabby and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After an opening scene composed only of obscure intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage. to the futuristic credits of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are darker things. My Kent sees a kind of murky heckling on the farm and spends a good part of my life walking slowly toward debris in the cornfield. Then Superman approaches her and faints. <br /> <br /> We then join Lex Luthor in a scene featuring many glaucous close-ups of an old lady who dies. We will not see Luthor's face before the end of the scene, a recent example of the film's desire not to leave any stonework behind. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he is not human. In addition, he probably does not like humans either, because the film sometimes presents a sort of plot on the fact that Lex Luthor plans to kill most of the Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent returns to his place. old job (I forgot to mention, he had gone on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then he discovers that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and goes out with Cyclops. It annoys him so much that he loses control of his super force to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Miss Lane is on a kind of jet attached to a sort of space shuttle. It's a kind of important event because of that, it's on television. We then learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching him on television and pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved in cutting themselves off most of the summer. <br /> <br /> While the events that preceded the inevitable disaster accelerated, I apologized for getting a soda. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and watched this movie on Al Gore showing slides in full. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but ended up in Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to stop playing. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, I found my seat and I looked up to see that the impending Space Shuttle disaster Lois Lane was about to happen. Yet it seemed like an eternity, so I walked around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son, and sent him to college. As I was studying at my son's medical school, I remembered that I probably should be educating myself for Superman's return. I apologized and went back to the theater to learn that there was no need to hurry up. It still took about half an hour before things went bad for the Space Shuttle Lane. At that time, Superman saved everyone, which was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. And then there's a subplot where Superman gets really terrifying and starts hounding Lois Lane and her family with her X-ray vision and super-audition. Then he tries to convince her to deceive Cyclops, who seems to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in a sort of contest to display all the possible generic behaviors of the bad guys before the end of the movie. . I forgot to bring my dashboard back with me (they gave you one at the door), but I think it was close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things are starting to get ready for the grand finale trouble. I think maybe the projector was broken, because the movie seemed to be kind of looping for a while here. I remember seeing obscure things coming out of the water, Superman getting sick, getting better and better, getting back to trouble, he's still sick, no waiting, he's still going. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor unleashes his final. wicked move: shout a little to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over and I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the retirement home where I lived was a bit cold. I realized that I was leaving my sweatshirt at the theater and I went to get it. When I did it, I was a little surprised to find that Superman Returns was not finished yet. I tried to ask viewers what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with a long gray beard. <br /> <br /> I sat in my old seat and saw Lois Lane wandering around her house. for a moment. Then Superman arrived and began to quote the beginning of the film. Since I already saw this part, I thought it was okay to leave. <br /> <br /> That's what I wrote about Superman Returns. <br /> <Oh, too, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about a dog eating another dog, you'll love this movie. Because of that, there are two jokes like that.
