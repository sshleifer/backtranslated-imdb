DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU LIKE THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL DISAPT YOU BAD! First, this movie starts with Bo and Luke looking for Moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would never do that on the real show! This film describes unimaginable characters doing things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and law-abiding. In this film, he is a criminal who makes the moon and smokes cannabis with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if it was an extension of the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Hazzard dukes in Hollywood, I have a question: how can JESSE ONCLE DO MOONSHINE WHEN HE HAS DEATHED AT THE HAZZARD SON IN Hollywood? AND HOW BOSS HOGG IS LIVING WHEN HE DEATH BEFORE THE MEETING MOVIE IN 1997! FILM AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? It seems magical that these characters came back to life, when they died for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, it should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they had done in 1997 and 2000 and make a family friendly film with the original characters the show what it was and is still compared to this disgusting and disgraced movie! If you want to see good movies from the Dukes, buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy the DVD game that includes Reunion, and the Hazzard Dukes in Hollywood movies! They both play in the original cast and are family friendly! Do not waste your time on a movie that is not worth the CD on which it is written!
