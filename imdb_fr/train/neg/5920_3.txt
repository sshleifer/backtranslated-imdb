Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual frame for an American movie dating from the war, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual subject, four sisters and their relations with the American soldiers, one of them carrying the illegitimate child of the son of a deceased senator, to another living with seven Marines (one to at the same time) before being murdered by her husband of returning New Zealand prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see Paul Newman perform such a bad performance so soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant movie "Someone on top loves me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for two beautiful "stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves on a film. <br /> <br /> Unusual that I can bother to write a review of such a mediocre film, do not miss it!
