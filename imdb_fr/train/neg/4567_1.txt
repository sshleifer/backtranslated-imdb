What a mediocre picture of professional police officers is displayed on television when watching this supposed reality show. One can only hope that the reasonable suspicions that lead to a probable cause lead to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a "stop", then the "Pat Down" from the outside of his garment, then to be able to explain why the officer went into someone's pocket and recovered contraband, was cut off the backstage, because otherwise, the arrest in most places will be thrown away, even if they happened in front of a supervisor. Signaling a warrant on the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person sending the document has the original warrant in hand. If the dispatcher reads a printout from the computer, that is enough for an arrest, but that does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in effect. Since I have not seen a CAS claimant (I may have missed it), CAS could be in trouble.
