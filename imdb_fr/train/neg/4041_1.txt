Like wearing a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without a doubt one of the worst movies of all time. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. A long, tedious, laborious, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and majestic scene. Destined to be dreamlike and impressionist, the soul laid bare, it is on the contrary morose. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son grope and murmur as lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. Okay, so what? <br /> <br /> The son repeats more than once the line, supposedly lifted from "Lives of the Saints", "The love of a crucified father, a loving son is allowed to crucify." The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is heavy, unimportant, and dazzling, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some references on the theme of Russian filiality: "Mother and son" (1997); "The return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "The Karamazov brothers." <br /> <br /> The credits in English indicate a planned international distribution, which means that the excuse can not be invoked that one must be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> It is far from being as successful and convincing as the last "Russian Ark" of Sokurov (2003). <br /> <br /> As in "Mother and Son", an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors, but not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, filmed from beginning to end through beige filters, which makes it as visual as it is very numbing. A fuzzy veil only adds to the drug sensation. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack on which buzzes, never closes, like a band loop. An old radio plays constantly in the background. Russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "themes based on Tchaikovsky". The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that all these irritating little sounds, static radio waves, noises, distortions, etc., are "designed". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. All this seems as arbitrary as a traffic, as improvised by bored actors, rising from nothingness to nothingness. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to signify the thing without being the thing, so what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, just the idea of ​​a shell. Can we ask for a better definition of decadence?
