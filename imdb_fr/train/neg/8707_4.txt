It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I praised it as a joke, expecting to make the first scenes laugh, and let me just say that I have never laughed so much in my life. The first scene where ninjas pop up randomly in the air and start a huge and ridiculous battle of fire is one of the funniest moments of stupid action movies in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but rather a movie that makes fun (and does not mean at all) of the action genre. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed it too much. If you want to see a film that goes very well with a six pack or herbal remedy, then please rent this movie and sit back and watch 100 years of progress in the cinema throw in the trash and get heckled by Carnosours
