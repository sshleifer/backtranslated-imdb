Words can not just describe how awful this movie is. I watched it on video last night and I just could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" talks about a former soldier (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who was held captive by Rednecks at the Deliverance. The film, the script, the writing, the production, the photography and the editing are deplorable, as well as a song called "Soldier" which must be one of the worst songs of theme of all times! <br /> <br /> However, there is a treat. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) of "Welcome Back Carter" plays in the movie a nasty laughable character. Otherwise, avoid this mess at ALL PRICES.
