- A little bit of time is misleading the head of the local mafia with a lot of money. Of course, the mafia boss wants to get his money back and does not care who he has to kill to get it back. Punk recruits his friend and an old gangster to help save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it sounds ridiculous, it's true. It is simply ridiculous to think that this punk, dressed in Izod and carrying a buggy, could retain one of the most powerful monsters in Rome. His friend may be good with a gun, but he runs into a group of trained killers. The old gangster is only a comic relief and no real help to face the crowd. There is also a subplot about how the mafia boss killed this friend's father years ago, but it does not help much and it does not help the film. <br /> <br /> - The mafia boss, Mr. Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I guess he got the name because he has what looks like a shave on the cheek. Palance is as inefficient as the rest of the cast, doing what it takes to earn pay. <br /> <br /> - I recently saw very good Italian police / police films, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Discover rather Syndics Sadists or Revolver.
