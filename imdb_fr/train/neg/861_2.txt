A disappointing film. <br /> <br /> The story establishes that our protagonist is Chrissy, a "young" person, rather sullen adrift, who drifts and does not do much. In fact, she does very little to advance the story, so it did not surprise me to see that attention was shifting to her loved ones. Too bad though, Chrissy seems to be an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes quite formal. The question now is: when will we see Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori with captivating stories told in a cinematic way that will inspire rather than entertain for two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting filming film.
