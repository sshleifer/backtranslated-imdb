I realize that this is not supposed to be BSG and that I can handle slow-paced shows if they are interesting, but I find myself completely indifferent and bored by this series. <br /> <br /> BSG's formula seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Scifi Moderate <br /> <br /> Maybe it will become more interesting but from episode 3 I can hardly watch it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my watch list for the week. It's a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night programming. What has become of the glorious days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
