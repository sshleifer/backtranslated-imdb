This is a tame bit of fluff about the codes of the Second World War being broken, stolen, etc. The actors' game is what I expected from this cast of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> A big congratulations. Jean Rogers, who played so sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon series, is awful in this movie. His character is extremely annoying. She absolutely never lets down with her overactivity. We are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war, in what would obviously be a top secret code installation, she would be allowed to enter and leave any office of her choice even though she did has no official function. From this point of view, I'm sorry I have never watched this movie. That changed forever my perception of Mrs. Rogers. In terms of talent, she is extremely light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is as usual, which means he's just good enough. <br /> <br />
