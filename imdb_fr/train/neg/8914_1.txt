I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious viewers) twenty minutes because it was pretty mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that I was soon on the verge of tears about the 3 , $ 99 I lost at Blockbuster. The acting of Joanna Pacula and her dramatically restored Slavic accent are terrible enough to make us clench our teeth. I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by innocent actors with remarkable talents. While we are talking about talent, Breuer's excessive assistant seems to have been removed from a local theater troupe. She clearly did not learn her job. In fact, she is really awful. All the public scenes appeared to be staged, the extras moving mechanically under their best Sunday. Disabling this movie was much more satisfying than activating it. Do not rent this terrible movie. You will be sorry for spending your money.
