It's the worst movie I've ever seen in Billy Zane. I understand that this film was primarily intended to introduce newcomers, who did very well for beginners, but overall, the film was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all the gunshots, one would think that the police would have intervened. Even the room being an insect on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is the bug, was unrealistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie was slapped fast. Bad work. Get a better copywriter. <br /> <br /> The countdown has not been synchronized with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy explodes Sean, he will run out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character was clumsy. It was so stupid when Sean hit him in the end. It was like a comedy. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
