Is Miike like Chabrol, alternating art and shipwreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does it correspond to the fifty / fifty rate some claim for Chabrol? Do we see here too much or too little Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines by quoting the flights, allusions and clich√©s of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call). Others here will affect most of them, but not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the shady television broadcast disturbing supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi took the mother-like zombie in one arm, One One Missed Call surprised me a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (who looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in Audition, in the unfathomable story of Assition, and as Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki in the drunk drowning tank and more, is perhaps the most compelling character actor I've ever seen never seen. So here's a cop.
