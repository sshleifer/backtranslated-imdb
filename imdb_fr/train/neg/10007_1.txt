This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her dog-like behavior of "Law and Order" continues in a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one to have escaped this horrible anti-comedy unscathed. The marriage of Charlie and Denise is the only positive thing to get out of this mess. Hope this effort will produce better results.
