Movies like these are at the origins what Album Oriented Rock stations are what the music was once - repetitive, boring and drained of all the original energy by a company drone board. I am happy that Aragorn has not been cataloged as a future psychopath by this P.O.S. Return to the 1971 version, count everything that would NEVER appear in a modern version and thank the deity you worship if someone loved to have the bomb to write and turn an original concept that was not based on ideas from someone else, and was not passed on to a board of directors until it was created.
