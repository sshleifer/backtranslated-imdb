About halfway through, I realized that these characters did not matter to me; However, I watched a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I should not have worried. <br /> <br /> If you know * something about the movie in advance, you know that the main character will be a survivor of a plane crash - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what is it going to happen after - he will call and call people about it! It was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane". <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an old movie and that the style of play was then much less naturalistic than today. But even at these standards, the acting was embarrassing. They were not characters, they were stereotypes. I guess this film was primarily an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). In vain have I seen oaks manifest an emotion more sincere than him. <br /> <br /> Davis' role in the merry crippled (ie, non-glamorous role) was probably perceived as a bold and daring career change. It was not. It was just boring. She was a kind of little Tim in the movie, leaving Trask (Merrill's character) to understand the truth about love and forgiveness (even though she was less seductive than Tiny Tim), calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without suggesting that her beloved husband has just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene, where Trask recalls his wife in Iowa to reconcile, was so touched and acted too much at both ends of the phone line that I almost collapsed. I had to remember that these people had actually been paid for what they were doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people seemed to have enjoyed this movie. If you found that uplifting, it's great. But frankly, I just found that bad. There are many old movies from the Hollywood Golden Age that were much better written and performed.
