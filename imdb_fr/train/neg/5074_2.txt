I saw this film two weeks ago at the festival of new images of Japan in Paris. Although I did not expect much, I must say that I was disappointed, like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to sum up how I felt, I would say that I compared it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's silly. But I could not help it. The stories are quite different, but the worlds represented are very similar. And from this point of view, "a palm tree" certainly can not stand the comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if he's good enough technically, the boredom remains ... in the end, his total lack of originality makes me advise not to watch. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a little hard, I guess it deserves 3 or 4)
