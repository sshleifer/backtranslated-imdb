While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is stung by a bat, which causes alarming side effects ... <br /> <br /> An atmosphere sometimes gloomy and decent makeup effects (well that underused) do not save it B horror movie to be a tale of the human-becomes-creature tale. The Bat People, aka It Lives By Night, suffers from its foolish, clumsy storyline. The plot never seems to go anywhere and the movie never offers an explanation or even a satisfactory conclusion for everything that happens. The cast is quite mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> Still, I give some points to the movie for its haunting theme song and its nice filming locations. The makeup of the late Stan Winston is also very good, but it does not have much value here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the smallest creature-men is agitated. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
