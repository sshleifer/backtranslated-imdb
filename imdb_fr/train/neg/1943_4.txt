What a desappointment! It started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Certainly, he was moving at the speed of a snail, but I was still gripped and watched. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good value and Suranne Jones was good in the lead. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were fascinated by possible terrorist relations. <br /> <br /> But Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was dull, dull, dull. All the beer turned out to be very small and the denouement was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for that? My advice: watch the paint dry instead.
