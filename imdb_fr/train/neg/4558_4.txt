Honestly, I was disappointed with "Expiration Date". Super intelligent title and interesting premise, but I do not think it has been made. What was it? The desire of the main character to reconnect with his native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to conquer his fear of death. But he was not designed to live his life in fear - it seems his life is going well, but since Domsday is coming, he should now start worrying. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the characters in the movie did not seem to have needs that blended into a global story. They all did their work, parallel to the main character. In addition, what was treated as a "curse" was more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he plan to stay in his apartment all day for his birthday? These are my critics, but I loved Seattle's plans, the cinematography was beautiful, the acting was good at a time when it was not exceptional.
