The sun should set on this movie, forever. <br /> <br /> This lasts forever (which is usually not a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List), but is so tedious. The aging of the actors is incredible, as is the long story that seems to go really nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
