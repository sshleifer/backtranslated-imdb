Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was solely responsible for some of my favorite horror movies (such as Edgar Allen Poe's "Red Death Mask" and "Pit and the Pendulum" adaptations), as well as some unbearably cheap and tacky quickies. (like "creature of the haunted sea" and "she gods of the shark reef"). Corman also made two films that are simply unclassifiable and ?? quite simply ?? almost impossible to judge correctly. "The Trip", for example, as well as this imaginative title entitled "Gas-s-s-s" can somehow be called psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange movies influenced by hippie culture. Half the time, you do not have a clue what's going on, who these characters are coming and going across the screen and where the hell is going on all this stuff. The plot is simple and yet very effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released and quickly annihilates all the world's population over 25 years old. That * could * be the basic premise of an atmospheric, grainy and exhilarating atmosphere A post-apocalyptic science-fiction monument, but the writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a triumphant road movie comedy . None of the characters even tries to prevent their inevitable impending deaths; they just went to the streets and found small, juvenile offender unions. "Gas-s-s-s" is a disappointing boredom and tries too much to be weird. The whole script seems to be improvised on the spot and not at all funny. It's certainly not my cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many fans, so who am I to say that it's not worth your time or your money?
