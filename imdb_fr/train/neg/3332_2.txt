I bought this film in a boots sale, so I did not expect a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought that it would always be pleasant enough to look at. However, that did not turn out to be pleasant at all, but instead, the film and the movie in general were ridiculous, such as how the "invisible killer" murders his victims and how all the people killed are just young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women in danger, most are killed. 2) We survive by crawling in the dark while being pursued by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I saved you two hours by summarizing this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you're lucky enough not to have to watch.
