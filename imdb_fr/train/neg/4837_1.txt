I went to see this movie just to see what all this hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised at how it got 6 (?) Oscars and a rating of 7.9 on IMDb as of 'today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director of all time to win the best Oscar and Best Achievement for this kind of really bad movie and I wonder why? Is the totally unrealistic "cowboy" scenario of bomb destruction meaningful to someone I have not seen? Why did I continue to have the mental image that this film was a remake of a bad old western movie about a cowboy performing "brave acts" in the Wild Wild West, infected by Red Indians? evil "; but just that it was in a different context this time? Has it been awarded to the Oscars because the director, formerly James Cameron, has made a great story of outsider (gossipy) for TV shows of the day? Or was it some kind of emperor's clothing syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just could not say it because others did not seem to say it loudly high? <br /> <br /> And finally, with what this scene of sniper where they showed the case of the hull falling in high resolution, super slow, as if to transmit a "deep message" or other thing? Something in the lines of "EOD guys make good snipers suddenly and they're going to have dirty terrorists all the time"? Was it just me who felt that there were so many pieces here and there in the film squeezed for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscars to edit and direct them for that? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money on notes. Wait until they go on television in a few years. You will not miss a lot.
