I have seen this film several times in various short film festivals and I still feel like I have seen a trailer! <br /> <br /> For a school film, it's very well produced and directed, but the story ... well, it needed something else to be a bigger and more interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed a thorough approach. This is something that is missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is still superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
