I read the reviews and even though I did not expect private savings, I was expecting a movie of any substance. <br /> <br /> The film begins very lobed with the usual intro of the story and how the unit came to be. But immediately, we are in 1944 and you do not know where everyone is. The accents, etc., are very mediocre, because this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / American, but everyone speaks very poorly to the Harvard imitation of a Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 3 out of 10 because after 10 minutes, I could not look at it anymore. The characters were one-dimensional and although they were probably based on real people, I had no feelings for them and it left me indifferent. Very bad direction of a very average TV movie that will be broadcast at midnight on a cable channel. I would avoid and seek better efforts. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, but it deserves to be better told. You have the impression that the director has seen a group of brothers and think it's enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and watch group of brothers, airmen Tuskegee, Glory or any other film like when the trumpets fade ...
