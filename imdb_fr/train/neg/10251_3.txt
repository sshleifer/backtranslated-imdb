A lot of running. A poorly designed opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in the field of communications, who sends and sends signals in space, is caught by extraterrestrials. With his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and discovers secrets about them. He becomes rather traitor in the process. True, he has little choice. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a dull film with many long sections where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a trip through a wood, a survey of a building. That's what editing is all about. I guess the story would not technically support much more. Not much here.
