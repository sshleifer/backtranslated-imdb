The only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance of Thom-Adcox Hernandez that is underused in the film in the film. As usual, Tom Villard is good too. Otherwise it is c ** p. The possesor does not even exist, how does it magically change the letters of the theater marquee to spell "The Possessor"? Lame.
