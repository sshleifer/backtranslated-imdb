It's really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story, combining all kinds of things that make no sense. It just seems like a bad experience. Second, actors can not play realistically. They can not even speak as an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with it now?
