The film did what it was intended to do: show a girl how to deal with poverty and reach maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been sufficiently explored and, in most cases, more sophisticated than it is here. The film focused on breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If it was on TV, I would have switched to the latest news from Starr Report. That's how I found this film boring.
