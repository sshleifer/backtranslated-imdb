Now, I went there out of curiosity and had to keep watching - the same way you look at a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a travesty, but it should not stop me from criticizing the terrible direction, play, and dialogue of God. Seriously, this is one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and another ... <br /> <br /> Okay, some critics (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we suppose it's a heart attack), the army then throws shells, rockets, bullets on the monster - a few feet from the doctor - Yet the doctor is not hit by any missile and is still alive (2). The attack of the army at a hundred meters and we see a flamethrower used. Damn, these objects do not have a range of more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to pick up the teacher, the soldiers run into the classroom and shoot at the ceiling; the monster drops the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) the monster looks like something from Power Rangers! (5) There is a scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we have reactions (along the lines of the mouth to ear) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general flees just a few times (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did I mention the monster in costume rubber ???? (10) this horrible music, non-stop!
