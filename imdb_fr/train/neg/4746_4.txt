There are several problems with this film - the character of Brenda Song is one of them. I do not think the girl is an ugly actor, honestly, I do not do it. I think we give him bad lines. She's just supposed to be "that vain and rich girl" and, even if it's funny in the TV shows she's playing, it can not even make me laugh here. <br /> <br /> So, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so bad ... at first. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, pretending to be a reincarnated monk, pursued you by ordering you to wear a medallion and insisting that you should fight the "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know that this film is entirely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" of Wendy's family line were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt that the monks were content with that. Of course, they might have got there one way or another, but they gave no explanation. By doing so, they have just contributed to the many attempts to empower women made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> That does not prevent that from continuing, however. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film continues. Yes, she's a teenager, and it's close to homecoming - I mean, who wants to fight the evil during homecoming? The problem is that when "evil" begins to appear, Wendy does not seem as panicked as she should be. She is extremely careless, even for someone like her. She continues not to worry about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will prevail and all that is good will be gone." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about the pressure, well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's go Wendy. Let's also dance while you should train properly. Of course, Shen lets her do it, but her character has an excuse. It is better for him to cooperate with her rather than not him and not train at all and not kill them both. <br /> <br /> Oh, talking about that. Shen also told Wendy that her destiny was to die for her in battle, as he had done for her great-grandmother (I guess this part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. According to the scriptwriter, Wendy's return and this "great battle" are exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she ends up going to battle, because when she tries to leave for the homecoming, the monks (whom Shen had trapped in the body of her trainer and her teachers because she "felt weird to fight against an old man ") informed him that Shen left alone in combat, so she will save him. <br /> <br /> We first see half-decent fights, it's really entertaining. Until, finally, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival's body for the homecoming and creates the very embodiment of himself from the broken fragments of the body of his old warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy is panicked. Then Shen defends her against this guy - forgive me for forgetting her long Chinese name - and manages to get killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy surprises Shen as he makes a long descent after sinking into an uncomfortable position. air. <br /> <br /> She screams the title of this article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful too fast. No, I will not let her excuse because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power in her". <br /> <br /> Since when did she learn to heal? No, worse ... since when can she resuscitate people? So Shen rose from the dead. Then, Wendy and him fight the guy. <br /> <br /> It loses the way easily. The worst thing is when they jump together and hit him at the same time, and he's banished forever. Then the monks congratulate Wendy for her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, n Â° 1: do not the scriptwriter and the director know that a battle needs a little more "finesse"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she did not go home? Because the girl did not sweat, or even bleed. I mean, let's go now, this movie was PG TV, I wanted to see someone hurt themselves. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... move on. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I should have given a movie to the movie, based on my comments. Part of the criticism you must know, however, is to break a thing. You do not necessarily try to find the wrong one, but if it's there, you point it out. This film has a lot of bad sides, but there is something funny happening when you never really expect something to be too great at first. <br /> <br /> So, I guess everything was fine. Not that I do not say that all was well would have prevented anyone from looking at him.
