This film is hilarious. The problem is that it's not a comedy. A classic scene involving Kurt Thomas has just found a pommel horse in the middle of a village square (which he uses to hit the bad guys.) Another is the hike in the "Village of Crazies". Too bad this movie was not meant to be a joke or got better grades.
