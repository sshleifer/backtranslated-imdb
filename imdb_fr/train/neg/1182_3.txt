This movie is little more than poor quality porn, and that says a lot considering the similar shit that was made at that time. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique cinematic experience". He was right. I guess he meant that as a joke. Not disgusting, not even shocking. Just a mediocre game and bad attempts at shocking art. A bit of camp value, although I do not think the filmmakers wanted this. And yes, as a previous speaker mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear costume. Do not spend a lot of money on that. Try to borrow it, if you have to see it. Or contact me, I would love to sell you my copy at half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to see another film from this particular director because he seems to have some success. But if it's something like that, I'll regret another 2 hours of my life spent forever.
