I hope you are joking?! A show featuring someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? What talent do you have to do that? She may be able to cook, but this is NOT described in this painful production that stirs the stomach for half an hour. I know she has a Martha-Stewart-Esquire empire. It's the same for Warren Buffett, but I do not see it with fake knockers opening canned corn cream and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking to anyone with such a stupid name. <br /> <br /> We spend more time at the "table-scapes" than in the kitchen. Who has this kind of time ?! Silicon should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
