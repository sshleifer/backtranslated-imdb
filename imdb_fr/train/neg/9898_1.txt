This version of "Moby Dick" insults the public by claiming that it is based on Melville's novel, even going so far as to show a sentence from the first fictional chapter rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael". In addition to having an excruciating acting game, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of the path traveled by Hollywood (especially the beginning of Hollywood) to revise and change a famous novel just to boost his chances at the box office. the beautiful poetic language of the novel has been completely eliminated and Ahab has become a madman, blasphemous and obsessive, in a dashing and misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance has moved away from him leg. To this is added the devilish type brother who wants the fiance for himself and a different end!
