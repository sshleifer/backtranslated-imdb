Historically accurate? Hmm ... maybe ... if you squint, and the light just falls on the subject. But the fundamental precision does not compensate for a lamentable plot, irregular and incoherent, tons of dialogues in cardboard and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are only characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from "enigmatic and noble" Native Americans to "stifling but sadistic" British officers. A miserable and unworthy interpretation of a fascinating period of American history. I want my money back.
