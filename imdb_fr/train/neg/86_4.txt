As a Southern Baptist, I am saddened to have to score below average on an openly Christian film. I certainly do not want to discourage filmmakers of a terribly under-exploited genre. Nevertheless, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typically Christian film, modest budget, discreet. The plot is predictable, the mediocre acting (I'm nice) and the atrocious editing. As a TV movie, it could have been slightly above average, but as a feature film, it leaves a lot to be desired. Keep trying guys. You must have a movie about real Christians in you somewhere. May I suggest you to be inspired by G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis?
