As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a penchant for the city, I was eager to see this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the actor and production values ​​are not bad, the scenario is horrible, the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive he is in his vision of women. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not suggest this film to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment for the city that bears his name.
