I just realized that by watching this movie, I lost precious precious moments of my life that I will never find again. This film is not only poor, it is terrible. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia considers it a racial problem, apparently the "Whites" do not like it because it does not have white actors. Mate, I think you'll find the reason why nobody liked this is because looking at dry painting is much more fun and fun than this pile of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Stop making shitty movies.
