I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I told myself that no matter how stupid this movie would be, I'll at least be able to see him kick ass, right? False. It's a monotonous waste of useless talk, half-assorted screenplay and meaningless intrigue. There are few action scenes of any type, let alone martial arts scenes, and some of them are filmed and edited so badly that you can not even know what's going on in the world. The dub is also atrocious, and maybe the idiocy of this film is better illustrated by the fact that it is supposed to represent the Italian mafia ... EXCEPT IT'S ALL Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you would see better martial arts by looking out the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes.
