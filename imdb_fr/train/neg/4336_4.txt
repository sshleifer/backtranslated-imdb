I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now, I know people will say that the prequel was created on a small budget, but it never has anything to do with a bad scenario. Now, maybe it's just me, but I always thought that a pretext had been created to mount the other movie, featuring some main characters and maybe a little more about life that we did not know . Rise to Power is just a movie called Carlito. There should be at least some characters from the original movie, the ending is meaningless compared to the original. At the end of this film, he withdrew with his sweet heart, but how can we get him out of prison in the next movie? And his wife is not even the same woman he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say that the film is slightly entertaining in itself, with some decent snatches, but it is derisory when it is held for its big brother. Do not stay awake at night waiting, look at the original one more time if you really need a tube.
