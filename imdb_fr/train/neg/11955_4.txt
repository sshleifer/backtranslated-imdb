"Visitor Q" is a failed attempt at black comedy that focuses on what could be the most dysfunctional family in the world, including physical violence ranging from assault to murder to incest, necrophilia to a breastfeeding mother who cares for her husband and adult daughter, etc. The film is so outrageous that it has garnered praise and created a little cult. However, with home video quality and sloppy production, "Visitor Q" simply does not take for granted, even out of curiosity. The genitals are unclear and the sanitary devices visible, makeup is awful and everything else is at best amateur. A waste of time. (C-)
