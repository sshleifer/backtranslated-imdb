A friend already asked me to read his screenplay that had been chosen by a movie studio. To say that it was one of the most inept and tasteless scripts I have ever read would be a bold euphemism. Yet, I never told him that. Why? Because in a world where movies like "While She Was Out" can be green and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a scenario lacking personality, content and common sense does not guarantee that he will not sell. <As so many other critics have pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly underwritten film of Woman-in-Peril that abused housewife Basinger, chased by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve . All reproaches are legitimate, from weak dialogue to badly done acts, to enormous mistakes of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are some things that struck me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how we are supposed to think that her husband is a fool, the house is a mess with toys. Since when has it become child abuse to make children look after themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racial difference gangs are rare, except in Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course, the movie is stupid. But the countless "thrillers" I've encountered are also, where women are portrayed as groaning and defenseless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman make the most of her executioners. <br /> <br /> 4) I loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous critic invented this sentence, I really think that this film should be renamed "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
