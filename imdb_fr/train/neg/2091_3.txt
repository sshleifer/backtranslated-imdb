I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember the chair I was sitting in. This show was magical. It has become alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed parts of the third year and watched each episode of the fourth year with total loyalty in the hope that he would somehow turn around. Well, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and was captivated. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching regular episodes, and they get more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the politically correct funny of his latest failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his online work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was particularly true from the beginning, when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes defined by the first series of GRB. When they left after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the pot. It was as if he had written the rest of the series without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few initial weak episodes. But I am very very nervous.
