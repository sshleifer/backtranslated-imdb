This thing is really ugly. There is no heavy character, they all float in the BG. Motion capture is a great toy, but this movie shows that you really need people who know the animation to make an animated film. THE MACHINE CAN DO NOTHING WELL ONLY. If you see it as a weird movie, you'll have fun finding continuity errors ... IN A 3D FILM !!! It's funny to see the princess dress moving as if nothing had happened. You need animators and 3D animators, not data inputs that know 3D programs. Note the junctions, like the elbows, how they have lost volume and have become distorted. The person who made the character's design (a very good one) was persuaded when he watched them move, but you can not say they come alive.
