I respect the fact that it's a very popular show. However, compared to Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, hilarious and revolutionary 1970s classic film, this show was probably meant to be less than mediocre ... even if it lasted eleven years, that does not necessarily make it any good. This show was an integral part of my childhood (it was rebroadcast every night, and guess who the parents were watching and laughing at), but that's one of the memories I do not miss. And now that I have seen the film, I can give this series a precise critique. In itself, it's not bad "2 out of 10". However, the characters in this series are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them are technically identical, but their name is similar. For example, since when does Alan Alda look like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as is his characterization and his perspectives. The new characters are not so great. they simply serve to make you miss those they replace. It's the same with new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that is transferred to the series is Radar, which is still (even played by the same actor) a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yes. With a laughter track (no matter whether it is used in a surgical operation or not), it sounds scary, because of what happens in other contexts. And since it lasted nearly four times longer than the Korean War, it takes the viewer into this strange, temporary fracture that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I have never liked this show and I will never love it.
