A film a little disappointing, I would say: the acting was scalded, somehow. In many cases, I simply could not feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or intended for the scene. An angry character (or sad, happy, frustrated) should make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). This does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The comment about the authors assuming you already know the characters was apt. They do things and say things that come from nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to dinner; Then he explodes and goes out, slamming the door and saying to his father: "Do not touch me, you f ***!" Perhaps, if we had seen the prequel, we would understand where it all came from, but there is no prequel, so we are a bit at sea as to why! <br /> <br /> A strange and strange thing that Andrew does is go to an old stone quarry, sit on the edge and watch "calm water" underneath; then he puts his hand in the pocket of his jeans, extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times during the movie. I suppose we are supposed to see this as a tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It may be even four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he recently discovered that he had been adopted; this happens very early in the film, so there is no sense of the dramatic changes it might suffer because of this discovery. It's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's something else. <br /> <br /> I guess the film has a lynchian feel, but should a director for the first time really try a mountain so early in his career?
