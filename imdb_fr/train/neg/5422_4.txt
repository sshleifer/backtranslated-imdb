What "Noise" fails to do is to make us understand his character. Tim Robbins plays the role of an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer handle the intrusive sounds of the city, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a film that has as much creative credibility as "Death Wish". It's smart in points; especially a scene in which our hero tries to read through Hagel, "I'm too stupid to understand that." He reads and re-reads a confused paragraph, we read it and we do not understand it either. A car alarm goes off. Throughout the film, the alarms and noises of the city are constantly disturbed. Nevertheless, it does not help us much to understand our hero, who allows all this spoil his marriage and is distracted by secondary intrigues instead of digging deeper his personality. <br /> <br /> The film itself is too subconscious to notice its own sound problems, its poor quality editing and its visible arrow pickups. No, "the noise" is not so bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least, the end does not fall flat. Overall, it brings home a logistics point that you probably have not thought of. At least I did not do it. In total, ninety minutes, it could not have ended earlier. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost from the start. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those movies that you could see at a film festival, but that will probably not be selected for distribution. Watch it on DVD if you are really biased with someone involved in the project. Otherwise skip it.
