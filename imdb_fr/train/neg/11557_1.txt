* SOILER * That's wrong! All is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or something like that wants the castle and its title for himself. He therefore invests in this useless and excessively complicated and useless plan of SCOOBY-DOO to push Alan to commit suicide. Most of the film is him picking up redheads and attacking them. He does not even kill them. He falls asleep and the girl disappears and he thinks he buried them somewhere. If he looked at Evelyn's so-called ghost, he could say she was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not bother to watch, rent and if you bought it and have not looked at it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from EVELYN NIGHT OUT OF FALL. I give this sticker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
