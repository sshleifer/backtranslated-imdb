How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel NOTHING to be funny? Believe it or not, "House Bunny" did it better and funnier. Let's hope the directors had a great time and money - this film puts them all in trouble. It's a snapshot from start to finish. Clichés can work well with a script or at least one idea. This movie does nothing but uses cliché after cliché rather than ideas or a scenario. He uses the pre-existing characters of the actresses rather than developing characters. Bad, sad and bad. Now, I have to apparently have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT operations manager, this is another example of sloppy coding.
