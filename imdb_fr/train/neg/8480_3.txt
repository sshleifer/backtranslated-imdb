I can not say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. But again, I can not say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's a girl who skates, who is good at skating, who wants to go to an expensive school, can not afford it and has to take a hockey scholarship . She must hide her skating secret from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress who plays Katelin. She absolutely could not cry for her life, she just moaned, like a toddler pretending to cry to get along in her own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to behave in a pleasant and helpful way to people. In addition, the part where the two skaters call her and say something about her choreographer and she says she "draws the line" made me cringe. <br /> <br /> We all knew where she was going to go with her. and Spencer. Classically, they did not like each other and gathered at the end, it was typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a movie to watch if you like skating, but the main skater is extremely annoying. It's good to kill time fundamentally.
