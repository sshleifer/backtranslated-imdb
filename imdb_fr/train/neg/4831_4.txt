I rented this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars, to see if it was really so good. <br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is a very realistic representation (for the most part) of a soldier's rotation group. in Iraq. The film centers on Will James, a reckless soldier who pulls tears out of adrenaline while taking risks and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be missing, in my opinion, it's the plot and direction of the film. This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. What the film tries to do is to focus more on the characters and their different attitudes to the war. Bigelow does a good job focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be hanging out. Hurt Locker lasts 131 minutes and yet it looks like a 3 hour movie. <br /> <br /> A particularly horrible scene in the film, which ruined the film's perfect credibility, was the sniper scene halfway through the film. It was both unrealistic and very long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the film OK, but I gave a 6 instead of 7, that's because it was a major disappointment for the Best Film Award. at the Oscars. I thought this movie could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost in Best Picture, but was way better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down who won only 2 Oscars. Honestly, I do not know how this photo was won. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed war movie, rent Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
