It's amazing that such a clich√© and completely absurd script can make any screen, even the smallest one. The dialogue in this film gives Catwoman the appearance of a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmonica game, Elvis masquerading as a martial arts master who plays the life of a former football player who broke down, became addicted to the game, played by the winner of the television series "Next Action Star "from NBC. His performance is as cold as ice and not cool. The "movie" takes place in Vegas and since people play poker, the writers felt it was an ideal setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against a rich player and ubiquitous who offered his goal $ 2.4 million if he could. to pass through the day. And so the hunt ensues. A hunt soaked with unimpressive explosions, scenery of construction sites, a cinematography of poor quality and liners containing the word "bet" or "bet". The female winner is also sidelined, but I do not know why. Oh, but do not worry, fans of "NAS", the losers also make their memorable cameos. If you like predictability or plagiarism, the surprise ending will surprise you. Joel Silver should re-evaluate his decision to sell even more. I would like him to give me back those two hours of my life.
