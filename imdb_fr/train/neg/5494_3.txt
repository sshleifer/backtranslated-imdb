<br /> <br /> Not very beautiful and ugly, this movie did not even seem to entertain children, except for a funny joke on the toilet. Christopher Lloyd has surpassed his heyday and is actually quite tiring in this role, though the sad pretext for the jokes of the writers is of no help. Elizabeth Hurley is hugely embarrassing in a supposedly comical role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable to compare it to the often brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
