I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in the United States. Considering that this movie was made for television, it was interesting enough to watch more. So, I tuned for tonight's broadcast and was extremely disappointed. I knew that the movie would not please me, but I did not expect to be puzzled by the use of DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable if there had not been these juxtaposed digital plans that seemed to come from nowhere. I was expecting the plot to be related to these plans, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CAN BE A SPOILER !!!!) The open end in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open end on the suite is ridiculous. I can only predict that Return of Return to The Cabin, by the lake, will be visible if the film was shown against nothing, but informative ads at 4 o'clock in the morning.
