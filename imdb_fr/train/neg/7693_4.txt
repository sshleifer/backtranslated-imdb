Is there anything happening in this movie that is NOT predictable? I do not think so. Basically, the film is cliché after cliché and nothing is ever a surprise. This makes the film extremely predictable and because of that, the film is seriously underpowered. So, for a thriller, it's not quite tense and unpredictable, but it's also a dramatic failure. This is because the film's story is highly improbable. I mean, it's impossible for this to happen in real life, just as events happen in this movie. So the film has a real problem of suspense and credibility. <br /> <br /> But it's really the clichés that killed the movie. There were things that trembled sometimes. Everything is so formula in this film. The predator is portrayed as a heartless cool, almost psychopathic as a sexually frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts as if she sees nothing coming. Everything that was going on in the movie was so obvious and everything seemed to be happening for a reason. Such as the sequence in which the "predator" repairs the broken car of "victims". It must be one of the oldest clichés of the book. I knew what the film was trying to achieve later. I tried to give the impression that the teacher and the pupil really grew up to each other through the eyes of other people around them. It was so obvious and inexpensive that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that time. The film is filled with moments like these. <br /> <br /> The title might suggest it's a cheap porn movie, but it's actually a vampire for the TV movie. This means that everything happens slowly and that the film devotes half of the time to the development of the character and secondary intrigue useless to make it even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley plays pretty well. in this film. It gives the impression that some of the clichés and events are sometimes almost realistic. His career in Hollywood is as complete as after his appearance in the movie "Showgirls" by Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, it will probably only appear in TV shows like this one. It's a waste of her talent and she certainly deserves better. All other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the cliché like a handsome and untouchable boy and the way the husband of the main character is described is even worse. He is more like a sexually frustrated predator than the real predator of the movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in each sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before falling asleep, he wants sex. He comes home, he wants sex. It may be a realistic thing but I do not know, it did not seem fair to me for a film like this and the story in general. <br /> <br /> A movie full of clichés and I can not think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore also lacks suspense and credibility. It's not a "horrible" film and it's certainly a film that can be watched from time to time, but all the weak elements and clichés of the film also make it far from recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
