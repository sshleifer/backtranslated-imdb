After the reasonably successful MASTI that was a little better, Inder Kumar came back with a PYAARE MOHAN comedy based on the Hollywood movie DO NOT SEE THE SAME, DO NOT FORGET DEATH <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This film is a tedious exercise <br /> <br /> The film contains jokes of such absurdity that you do not want to laugh like Snehal Dabi's head gets stuck in the back of the horse and all those typical comedies that we do not laugh at now but that we do not care about <br /> <br /> The film begins so clich√© and some scenes are funny, unfortunately, such moments are not hard for a long time as the story does not move in this half even the comedy becomes boring The twist is well managed and the second half becomes a film of action where the blind and the deaf are going to save the heroines and we all the chase scenes and the fight scenes OTT <br /> <br /> The staging by Inder Kumar is bad The music goes well, a song comes off I love you my angel <br /> <br /> Vivek is horrible in comic scenes, his timing is very bad and is ok in serious scenes. For some reason, he continues to do comedy and ruined his career. Fardeen Khan is a little better but too much wood Among the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is fine
