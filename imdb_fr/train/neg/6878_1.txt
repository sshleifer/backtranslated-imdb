I'm Puerto Rican and it's one of the worst documentaries of my life. You can see that the people who work there are without ideas. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Ricans because they are descendants of this people, but they probably know less than others who are not. You can see as they speak that they contradict each other. If you want to see a real documentary, and I mean a real authentic documentary from Puerto Rico, then you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". It's a real serious documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was supposed to concern Puerto Ricans. They repeat that I did not know. Well, that's pretty much the only thing they found in this so-called documentary. I hate to see such waste being done using the name of the island. This lowers the standards.
