Not only have they misinterpreted the characters, not only are the voices void, but the screenwriters are in dire need of girlfriends, not only are the drawings really rudimentary, but it seems that the film was created primarily for ages 1-6 . The only episode of this series I've ever seen that makes me look is "A Mattter Of Family", because I like Robin's character. And sometimes, I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: in BTAS, Bruce is a friend with Harvey Dent, yes? Over a story of two episodes, he turns into an unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the "Show", Bruce is a friend of this guy Ethan, and after two episodes, he turns into an unlikely villain, ClayFace. It was just a small example (it may not even be true), but in short, it's the worst attempt on a Batman series. And it says something.
