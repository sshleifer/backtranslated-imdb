Buford's Beach Bunnies gives T-B category films a bad name As a fan of the genre, I was shocked to see that few attempts were made to exploit the talents of the young actress. I'm specifically referring to the lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What are the thoughts of the next generation of sad teenagers watching television late at night?
