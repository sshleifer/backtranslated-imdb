Whether it's acting, directing, scriptwriting or art direction, this film is totally ill-conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When did we become so sad that they have to fill a children's movie with sexual insinuations to keep the parents' attention? <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is rolling in his grave right now, with the "dirty ho" "SHIT" and fake erection scenes, etc. etc. etc. It's shameful to know how they exchange the name of Suess to get parents to bring their children, add insults to try for teens and some sad parents who will not watch a movie with their child if there is no from T & A. Greed greed and even more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this to classic children's movies and you'll get a disturbing view of the changing world. These guys should stick to making MTV videos. How on earth did this movie get more than 400 votes while a perfect 10 exceeds me? (unless it's the family of directors)
