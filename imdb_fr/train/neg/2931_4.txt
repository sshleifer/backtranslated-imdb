The sitcom "The league of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several strange inhabitants of the fictitious village "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their common frame. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a skit show, the main plot concerns a new road that will be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners are visiting the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" store, which is actually far from the city, do not like strangers. Every time a visitor enters their store, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drummers, while Tubbs dances half-naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition, Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local employment center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. Thus, when an unemployed person is interviewed as a firefighter, she does not allow it because he is not yet ready for the job. <br /> <br /> Then there's Barbara Dixton, a transsexual cab driver who spends a lot of time. detail on "his" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of treating them. In one case, he goes to a farm and is taken to the living room where a dog is lying in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming that the dog is the sick animal, Mr. Chinnery euthanized. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding in his hand the "real" sick animal, a sheep. <br /> <br /> Some additional inhabitants are a husband and his wife, visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by the store owners, by the way). The couple is very tidy. They have, for example, towels of different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and classified accurately. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are also suitable for actors. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of black humor, typically British. The scenography reflects the atmosphere of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and are run down. Around the local store, there is often fog that reinforces the effect of threat. Even the sign of the village is disturbing: "Welcome to Royston Vasey, you will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors are doing a great job, this type of series is not to my taste.
