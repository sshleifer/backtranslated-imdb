Here we have a film that fails in just about every possible way. Terrible scenario, unhealthy game, amateur staging, laughable special effects ... it's a very awful movie. Not to mention the fact that when you reach the end, you will realize that all this does not make sense. After spending the entire movie wondering what was happening in the world when things are finally explained, you realize that the story was built on ridiculously impossible foundations. In one of these ugly scenes "the villain explains the whole movie", we are told that our villain has done something that simply can not be done and that makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and after that, we see that there also seems to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to say that this movie never happened. If for some reason you are tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I suggest you take the time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. It would be a much more enjoyable experience than sitting in that trash.
