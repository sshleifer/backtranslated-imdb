The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a film that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that preceded it, from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but manages to do it with enough humor to make it visible ... barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogues are wooden, the story is thin and actors can not get out of a grocery bag. All this put together and you have a pulpy luscious ball for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a bit like this. Chew it for 90 minutes and you end up with a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
