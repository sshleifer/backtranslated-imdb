I've been a staunch supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw his short film "Surviving Desire" in high school and, even then, he was still completely moored by his awesome "Henry Fool". But this sequel to 10 years later is not only useless, but shameful. <br /> <br /> After a quick and jerky start, "Fay Grim" is transformed into pseudo-intellectualism, total boredom and ultimately unjustified - and undesirable - nihilism. And this is only the plot. <br /> <br /> The majority of new faces are as frivolous and undeveloped as the film: a particularly flat character ends up monopolizing half of the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool, and this is his only Spoken scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's Fulbright agent, it seems, is the only brilliant character (a pun intended by Hartley). How, then, did he leave? ** SPOILER ** Dead via a car bomb attack, making it easily Hartley's most violent and violent film to date, and a faux-ton ​​in a movie that's been wrong since word. <br /> <br /> As for other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay herself ... well, I will not spoil their fate because the film does its job pretty well. clean (when he is not dealing with another diabolical angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving back from Author to a shitty film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a horrible mess that is not even good enough to revel in this mess. Instead, he indulgently plunges his director's typically amusing pretenses into the "real world", uglier and wickier than it should be, but not ugly enough or mean enough to say anything. . In doing so, Hartley tracks all my memory of these people and the wonderful world he has created for them. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so depressed at the movies and I count. "Leaving Las Vegas," who at least developed new characters that we learned to love before destroying them, instead of immediately ignoring the characters already loved. <br /> <br /> Grim, indeed.
