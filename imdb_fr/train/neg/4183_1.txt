Without the "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this serial movie would not have earned a single sector of my Tivo disk space! In what low-rent, low-rent warehouse, was the supposed spaceport filmed? "Continuity People!" This is a basic principle in making a real movie! At night, a so-called spaceport and the day (night and day on a space station?) A warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I will recommend this movie for is the wardrobe department. to always keep Natassia in those tight clothes that reveal outfits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits in which she obviously spent time getting dressed, every day of filming! The science fiction channel would have been better to show SpaceBalls! At least, it would have been a bit of humor to watch something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please dismiss your agent as soon as possible! You are so much better actor than to be associated with this level of film making.
