I hate this movie! It was nothing like the book, and just thinking about it drives me crazy. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was amazing and this movie was like nothing. I mean, the general meaning may be a bit similar, but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The end for example! So, in the book, it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape a few seconds before the explosion of the hotel. but in this awful movie version, Jack makes them go through a stupid maze ... yeah, there's no labyrinth in the book and there's no reason for that. Another part that made me angry was that the jack had just killed Mr. Halloran! Hell, he's basically the book's hero and they kill him like he's not important. Overall, the movie was so bad.
