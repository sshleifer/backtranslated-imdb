This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely awful and hokie does not begin to describe the performances of each actor in this movie. The plot derives a lot from the decision of the executive, but compared to Air Rage, this decision is essential. I've never been so disappointed watching a movie. Air Rage must be burned with its ashes locked in a safe to never see the light of day. Everyone who has seen it should take a shower and get rid of the stench of a horrible movie. The best part of this film probably comes from the end, when the credits took place. It was the worst movie I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to Law and Order and the other characters in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to find themselves in a movie again.
