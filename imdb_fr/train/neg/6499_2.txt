What a messy mess. I saw him with a friend some time ago and we both consider ourselves open to the many wonders of cinema, but he's certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although there might well be good ideas / concepts and there is certainly good performance (under the circumstances), everything is buried in random nonsense. Sir Anthony relies far too much on the same genetic heritage as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films in editing, or perhaps he himself was inspired by Nixon. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he usually has a method to madness. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made the movie as a joke says it all. It's not worth your money, your bandwidth or your time.
