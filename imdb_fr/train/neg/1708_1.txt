Okay, I really do not have much to say about this movie, other than that: I've seen more than 4,000 movies in my life, of which over 2,300 were horror movies. Although I have a hard time deciding which one is the best (unlike my favorite, which is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror movie that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing positive to say about this film. The actors' game, the dialogue, the staging, the make-up, the music ... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable, it is beyond me to think that it has never been published . <br /> <br /> Even if you're a horror film or zombie complimentist, please consider my warnings and do not waste your time with this garbage. There is no pleasure in watching this. You will not even get laughs at the total nonsense displayed ... Trust me. Please.
