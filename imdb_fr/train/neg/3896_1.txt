Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule and says, "You did not live until you saw the sun through the rings of Saturn". nose bleeding. Then, West is back home in a secret hospital, a gelatinous and melting mass that breaks loose and forces a voluminous nurse to cross a fake glass door. Apparently, the West "gets stronger as it melts," which makes as much sense as anything in this desperately pure movie. Then, this "army brass" dopey, which looks a bit like Coleman Francis (director of Bad Moovies), tries to hide the information, but a race man will kill everyone he sees because he melts. He is attacking an old couple who is brawling because he is melting. He screams a terrible actress and moan for ten minutes, because it is melting. It melts because it melts. Rick Baker's fx is supposed to be the star here, but they just look hokey. The film is badly shot and everything seems so dark and confusing that it's very hard to say what's what - it would not help anybody. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this one ?? : = 8P ps - "Did not you have cookies?"
