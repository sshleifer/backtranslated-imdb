Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of his narrative styles, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The film becomes darker and more manipulative as it moves towards the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is more of an amateur imitation of Amores Perros and 21 Grams by Alejandro González Iñárritu, with many, many flashbacks. The problem is that the story is predictable enough VERY easily through the movie. It's a shame, because Seven Pounds could have been so authentically "good" if Ben and Emily had been put in good hands.
