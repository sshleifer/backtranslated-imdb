This life-style film takes the middle-aged divorced victim who finally fights the genre to the absurd as in a comic book. <br /> <br /> Here, the 40 something ex-housewife of a successful attorney protagonist (girl in college) starts a new life after her divorce, helped by a college friend at open a new clothing store as a kind of enlargement of the franchise. She even started a friendship with her attractive, a little younger perhaps, landscape / gardener (who is black). But then the horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, another woman she took as a tenant to leave a room, begins to "take charge" of her life. <br /> <br /> What this new threat actually does for younger women kindly flirts with the gardener and gives him a glass of wine that * blows * really belonged to the divorced woman! It raises utility bills by not lowering the thermostat !! and save the toilet! Too bad in the fridge! And hangs his (African) works in the living room !! And so on. She may have killed the cat too. Yeah, all right, the fact that he does these things is bad enough, but it's more than a bit ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. The reality of the character is that any small part of this would make this crazy woman crazy. , a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Supposedly this increasingly arrogant woman (natch) has a controlling mania. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight against this evil (and looking erotically hot, of course) 20 something. But there is this problem. Whenever something starts to get in trouble, she uses her POWER - and flirts or coats with a guy and escapes the consequences. (Well, there is actually something in this ability to look good at 20. It's not * usually * used in this way.) <br /> <br /> The premise is moved by the device of something like what the divorced is forced to formalize his room rental contract with a written lease produced by it Of course, the 40 something does not know about these things, and the 20 something had 'help. The lease actually gives the young woman an equal right to the whole house during the rental period, utilities being added to the fixed price. Although an eviction procedure is soon under way, something like that soon gets a temporary restraining order against the elderly woman, supposedly because she threatened that something. You know, the judge is sensitive to all the misfortune of the sexy girl. Finally, the fight for something "heroic" for The House begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or insightful thing in this film is the ease with which the TRO (or protection orders) are terribly easy to make so that the women do not do more than their unfounded - although they are generally only that easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and motivated to take control of a home as they are here. In fact, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often have them evicted from their own homes or co-ownership without any evidence, but only with an unfounded assertion of threats, and sometimes even without hearing from their supporters. Even when there is a hearing, it is usually impossible to rebut the threat allegations (to prove a denial), when the burden of proof really falls on the accused, not the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where this is true - and it is a blatant scandal of the overtaking of feminists, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course, this will probably not be a movie for life in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this film is based on the explanation that something like 20 is psychotic and does not take her medications. Even if it makes no sense. She does not seek after the lawyer's ex-husband, although she uses it (for the ex-wife's fury) in her quest. She is after THE HOUSE (technically, to chase her divorced during the lease period). This second wife is after all that left after the divorce, after business with other 20 year old, her husband !! (The ex-husband does not seem to be attached, and after his adventure, seems to be a little worried.No matter, he is still lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough to look for his age. But her point of view, her attitude and her concentration are so modest, so fragile and totally devoid of imagination and life force that it is impossible to worry about her. Well, I guess a small group of Lifetime fans cares about the average scores assigned to the small number of reviewers. (I kept looking at her only because it was extremely bad and caricatural that she had an appeal to the camp, I could not help but see how much they were going to take it.) > <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this movie). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a hint. The film ends with 20-year-olds coming out of prison promising to "listen" to his 20 male colleague and sometimes lover, and "do everything he says" and "let him take care of her" (he wants that she continue to take her medication) - then cheat on her and go home. There, she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonically tracking down her sworn enemy 40, who takes a bath by candlelight, convinced that the young woman is out of his life. There is a fight - and the something mom wins - by sticking on the 20th with a hypodermic needle filled with antipsychotic medication she found. She begins to caress her, mom and the two women have a moment of solidarity and feminine solidarity! How nice.
