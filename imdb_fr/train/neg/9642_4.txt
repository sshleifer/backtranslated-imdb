I could not believe the horrible dialogue that came out of people's mouths, and the end of the reels attached to the body of the movie was a real delusion. And we have pictures of Ang√©lique Pettyjohn (in a way) and Loren Crabtree. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by a psychic, Angelique Pettyjohn, brings a foreign container into an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, these are the remaining sets of Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film a higher value than its low price. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is an alien (played by Ray son) who begins to scratch people to death. It was quite funny to watch this little "creature" wearing a black reptile suit with what looks like big shells of beetles attached to it, running in the dark. We even get to see the little thing that strikes and tears an ET poster, which I found hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there is what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that was hammered Death by William Fair, after the mini-creature nibbles Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A small budget for ALIEN, I guess ... <br /> <br /> It all ends abruptly, it looks like they ran out of film in the end before the movie blooper came up with the end credits. Talk about a lack of funding ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's commentary that he also did not know if Aldo Ray would make the filming and remember his lines. He has hardly done. <br /> <br /> Sneezing with low-budget cheese. It's fun to watch, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
