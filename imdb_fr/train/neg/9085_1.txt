One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Playing was terrible for both children and adults. Most of the characters showed no, little or not enough emotion. The light was terrible and there were too many problems when shooting the film (in the scene of the river where they just had their boat destroyed, there are 4 shots, the sheriff and dad at night on their boat, Jillian and Molly swimming at night, the rest of the kids the day * when it's supposed to do it at night * by the river, and the doctor, BÃ©atrice and Simonton at night but not at night when getting off their boat. ) The best actor in the movie was probably the sheriff's, Cappy (although the pulse detector let a character escape) No matter what happens, people die, it beeps * shows that Cappy is dead, he moves, hears beeps, and while the extra nurse checks her pulse manually, she shows it again and THEN he finally dies.) I guess it will not be perfect because it's an independent film, but it could still be better. No need to look, honestly, even for children. You might as well watch something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story if you go see something you will remember.
