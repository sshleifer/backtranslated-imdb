Poor Paul Mercurio. After winning the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to do a lot of harm. None of the characters in this movie are really incredible or even hated, but Mercurio's lead is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - completely inimitable and he wears OVERALLS. Big mistake in the design of costumes, that one.
