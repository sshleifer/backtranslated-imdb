CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Format: 2,35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> During a visit to Rome, a noble lover (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but the rich father of Castelnuovo (Massimo Serato) opposes their love story, and Fate carries a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A love sexed-up story for the swinging 1960s, adapted from a literary source (Alexander The Lady with Camellias) of screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with free flair by Radley Metzger who, with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of "adult" cinema in the 1960s and 70s. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of "dolce vita" is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the film's sexual frankness seems alarming e compared to modern standards. The production values ​​are beautiful and the performances are engaging and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite the low dubbing post-synchro. Although unfolding in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's delirious scenes place the film firmly in his time, and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" score has become a cult item among opera enthusiasts. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but the fans of the elegant eroticism softcore of this director will not be disappointed. The next fight for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
