This film had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently made and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory. HOWEVER, all the rest is zero. The director, Emmanuel, is completely incompetent in making films. He uses some of the craziest plans of all time. <br /> <br /> - two random sequences of random images scattered in the film. I do not know if he tried to be deep, intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random shots of caravan in which lived the main character, random buildings, random panoramic shots of buildings, random cat moving away. WTF? And clouds. Many dark and dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - He really liked this technique of cutting a scene into several shots rather than taking a single shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his weed and the camera is spinning around him. Instead of one shot, it changes it into 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and smart! stupid. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible but that's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast because he rocks, turns and turns all the time. And some of the dead could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a well-built death, but no. A simple ear of corn in the ear. The interest of love was hot. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets a 2.
