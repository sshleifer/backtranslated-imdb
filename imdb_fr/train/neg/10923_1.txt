Telefilm about an ancient Egyptian curse inflicted on the United States in the 1920s when shooting DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and waking up when DeMille sets are discovered in the desert. movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is whether the filmmakers were serious or laughing when they made this film. If this is serious, it's a ridiculously bad movie and an excellent movie to brag about. If it's a comedy, it's less good but funny for all the wrong reasons. You'll be laughing at this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
