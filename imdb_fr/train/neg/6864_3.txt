There is a little spoiler below, which could spoil the surprise of the unexpected and really funny ONE scene in this movie. There is also information on the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I captured this movie on DVD, which someone offered as a gift to my roommate. It was a set with the first movie of the series "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This film was certainly much worse than the first movie, "La Noche del Terror Ciego". In addition, many features of the first movie have been significantly changed. In addition, the film was dubbed in English (the first was subtitled), which usually distracts me. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the series is that, in the distant past, a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in odious and secret rituals. After the discovery of these crimes, the local peasantry killed the Knights Templar so that their eyes could no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from hell for revenge. We then move to modern times where, because of an event, the Knights Templar were born from the dead to take their revenge on the villagers whose ancestors ruined everything. Of course, the undead knights have no eye, they can only find their victims if they make noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secret order dating back to the 12th century or so. Crusades. They have only been here for about 150 years, before being suppressed in the early 1300s by the pope and others. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially for initiation. Also, because of the way society was organized, there were not necessarily church leaders to oversee things, which meant they did not have an inner man when things were warming up. . And, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured to obtain confessions. The order was the strongest in France, but existed in Portugal and Spain, where the films take place. <br /> <br /> The first film offered a sacrifice virgin and the knights drank blood directly from the body of the virgin (chest shots here, of course, it's a horror movie after all), and then once the knights have come to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking them by the blood; in this sequel, all that disappears. You always have the same scene (redone, not the same sequence): they sacrifice the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from it. So when they come back, they just chop people with their swords or claw people, which, I must say, is a much less effective way of disrupting your audience. There is also a problem of time: in the first film, the dating is much closer to the Knights Templar, where it says here that it is the 500th anniversary of the cremation of the peasants who burned these guys, who would date around 1473. that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting too. In the first, they are pecked by crows. Now they are simply exhausted and in a rather ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie that reappeared in this movie (despite his death). This is not really a problem, because the film is completely different and does not constitute a continuation in the sense of a continuation, but it is nonetheless strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich character who uses child to distract the undead while he pauses for the jeep. The father of the child had already been tempted by this rich man to try to recover the jeep, so he went out and told him to find his father. It comes out of the shadows, and is easily the funniest scene in the movie. Of course, the reason why the child does not die at this stage is beyond me and I am disappointed by the horror fans. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it to anyone. It's not so bad that it gets funny, so it ends up being a poor horror movie. Most of the film is made up of several people in a church, each attempting to go it alone to escape the dead-and-blind who surrounded them. When the movie ends, you are not at all surprised by the result. in fact, quite disappointed. If you like the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film, go to the first film, which contains at least some innovative ideas and unexpected results.
