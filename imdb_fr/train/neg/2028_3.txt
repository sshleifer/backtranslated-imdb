On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should at least have finished a full season. Your host, William Shatner, has always been very entertaining, surrounded by a dozen fine pastry dummies grouped under the name "The Million Dollar Dancers". You had competent candidates who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and who probably knew a lot of questions about pop culture. And you had a lot of money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game has been failure. A good game show requires at least two of the following three things: very simple rules, exciting stimulation and the spectator's ability to play at home. The best and the most durable are all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had none. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were among the most complex of all prime-time television programs in history. Let me try to explain how the game works as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A competitor started with a single word or a short phrase followed by letters of choice A, B, C (subtle grip for the network?). ). Each letter was linked to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once the candidate has chosen one of the letters, he or she can either answer that question or succeed and choose a second letter. If they succeeded, they could see the next question and had the same option. However, if they answered the second question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After having answered and before knowing if their answer was correct, they then had to select one of the 13 dancers. on stage, each with a different amount of money in a roll by their side. They revealed their amount (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the candidate had correctly or incorrectly answered ... this amount would be added or subtracted from his pot. <br /> <br /> Still with me so far? In addition, there was a dancer who owned something known as "The Killer Card". If you selected the dancer with the killer card and you understood your question, you were safe and the game continued. If, however, you were wrong, you had to answer one last question. If you misunderstood your last question, you have been eliminated. If you understand correctly, the game continues. <br /> <br /> There was no quitting, no losing money until you answered six questions correctly or six times or you were so far away. the hole, you could not make enough money to go out. I got it? Okay! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the main problem was the total lack of tension, because of the design of the game. A competitor could pass questions that he knew he did not know and respond to. many questions he knew, thus reducing the pressure. Then they could still find a small amount, even after knowingly forgetting a question, which meant there was still no "drama". And the fact that they could answer five questions incorrectly while having a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pace of the questions was extremely slow: often, the questions were so obvious that it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The stimulation, the lack of real tension at all times during the show and these very complicated rules have prevented the operation of this program, despite the Terpsichorian talents of Shatner.
