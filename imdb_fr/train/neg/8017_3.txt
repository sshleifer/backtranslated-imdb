I did not really finish the movie. You can say that in this case, I do not have the right to examine it, especially so negatively. But I do it, only because I stopped it because I could not look at it anymore ... I came half way and I only got there by promising that something good was going to happen soon . This film is so tiring, so dull that I was really insulted. Since I have not read many other reviews, I'm not sure there are other gay teens who have suffered, but I am homosexual and have experienced "similar" revelations, dreams for a day, problems, etc. There may have been two moments when I felt that this film could go somewhere, where I felt it could have a little sense of meaning or relativity, but those hopes were dashed at the moment the next series of narrations full of clichés has begun. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear the scratchy reading or the echo of your eyes if you just read the quotes, because they are too painful / ridiculous / stupid to be missed. I gave the film three stars, and these three stars go to the director of photography who did a fantastic job trying to turn the tired "concepts" of Archer into something visible. Mind you, I'm praying that it was not him who decided to include all the long shots of televised close-ups ... another useless cliché already outdated in movies such as Korine's Gummo ... I think the fact that this film was created is perfectly appropriate for Sundance (only because Archer had contacts in the festival through his volunteer work, by the way) ... because Sundance seems to be the only festival where such a cliché is still accepted as an "artifice". No, it's not art house, I'm afraid it's just s ** t-house. Do not look.
