OKAY. I know that John Hughes' 80s movies were all one-sidedly flat, so the expectations for that film were pretty low. <br /> <br /> Yet, having passed through this shit, there is one key element that I can 'I have not just got out of my head: <br /> <br /> I come from watch an 80s film by Rob Lowe that had no nudity and only allusions to sex. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible, the characters boring and flat, the representation of Oxford an absolute insult and rowing scenes uninteresting, without history and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a strange Ally Sheedy or Amanda Country, Rob Lowe) fetish, there is really no reason to see this one.
