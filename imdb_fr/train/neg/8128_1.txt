OK, do not let my resume fool you. This film sucks hard. But the worst movie of all time? This movie was terrible in terms of people should not have to rack their brains to describe. But this is by no means worse than Manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, the horrors of Spider Island or a handful of movies. As a critic, the film is bad, it's terrible. Do not see it without STDs or you could develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
