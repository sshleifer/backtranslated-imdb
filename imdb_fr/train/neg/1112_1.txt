I like watching western movies, but this movie takes the biscuit. The script and the dialogue are laughable. The game was horrible, where did they get it? The music was OK I must say. Fortunately, I did not buy or rent the movie, but it has now. <br /> <br /> I was ready at the beginning when the unknown (martin sheen) started to tell his story. I must admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong pulled Tex's finger and told him to train for 40 years to reach his championship. But that's where everything turned into pear afterwards. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never.
