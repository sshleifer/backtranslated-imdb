I do not often go out of my way to write comments, but for that I had to, just to warn anyone who might think that by looking at this, they will see a comedy. It does not come near. Although the premise (change of color / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, more often before), the transformation of two black men into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever made. on the screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change of blank. However, the Wayans brothers must disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you guessed, they fail completely. I've seen drag-queens without makeup make women more convincing than those two with the best special effects and makeup people Hollywood can provide. It's terrible. Add to that a basketball player built like a building, a dreadful dialogue and more holes than a golf course. This film hits a new personal record. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
