I did not expect much from this movie - a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a plausible modern story - pleasant and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film has decided to leave aside the talents of the people involved in a simplissime, so diluted version of the source material that it is astonishing that they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights. It does not take into account that this is a story of people who are essentially inappreciable, generally unfriendly and often cruel to each other. This changes the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have an accomplice bone in her body - they stripped her of her blind idealism and turned her into a fucking accomplice. Heathcliff is a horrible person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version, Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in her custody. The dialogue is banal and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver anything with straight faces. Instead of depth or real emotions, we know that they have meaning when they scream in someone's face. I read reviews of the early 90s version, "Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte", in which Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche figured, claiming that she was transforming a gothic story of extreme darkness into a frenzied bust . Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes even further by using the basic story structure to offer shredded beach pieces to really bad music.
