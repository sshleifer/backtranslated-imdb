This film still cools me to the bone by thinking about it. This film was not only bad as in a low budget movie, badly played, etc., although it was certainly all these things. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to intentionally try to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is if it's supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's really horrible, but not like the horror movies are supposed to be. I could see the first segment trying to be horror and fail, but what the heck is the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching a student artist film, which makes it surprisingly the least painful segment. It is an atrocity that this film is not very low on the last 100, so get your votes (1/10) in number of people! I know some people have given these good reviews, but they are lying in a sadistic attempt to fool you. Believe me, it's impossible to love this movie. The only advantage of this film is an incredible effect that prolongs life: it feels like watching this movie for years after the first half hour.
