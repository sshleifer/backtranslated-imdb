One of the best candidates for the worst film of all time. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have a I.Q. of 3 who is only one less than the author and director. The script would not have gone into a writing class in high school; the jokes are juvenile; the nerdy concept. These artists were obviously desperate for work. I stayed until the end only to see if it would get worse. It made. Life is too short to watch the movie.
