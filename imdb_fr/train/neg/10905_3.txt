Guy is a loser. Can not have girls, needs to grow, is chosen by stronger guys, more successful, etc. See, watch, move. I must say that Rob must go beyond the part of his consecrated life to Adam Sandler. And get out of the intrigues of Adam Sandler. There are two fun parts in the whole movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "The Animal" is a correct movie. I usually like Adam Sandler's films that have the same plot. But it was too difficult to impress. The jokes are very old. So, believe me. This is not a movie in which most people could really enter. But some have done it, so I'll be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
