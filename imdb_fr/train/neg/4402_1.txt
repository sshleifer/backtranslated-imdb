I usually like lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I am biased, I suppose! <br /> <br /> But this one is just the pits. Yes, the landscape and buildings are beautiful, and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise, this film is a total waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and pummeling / taking drugs or alcoholic beverages, which is convenient, and Ella inexplicably resists this abominable behavior throughout the film. At no time do we understand why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there was at least some sort of closure in the (potentially romantic? We do not even know!) relationship between the two, there might be some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamaria asks Ella at one point "why do you love me?" Ella does not even recognize it. It's never really clear if it's a lesbian (who behaves badly) during a boring road trip with a heterosexual woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet The journey, which could have been lively and informative, is rather flat, tedious and above all incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, although I'm sure it was not intentional. Women travel in a two-seater Ford coupe with a medium-sized trunk. Yet, when they set up their camp, they have a huge tent, cots, sleeping equipment and even a table, a chair and a typewriter! On top of that, when they board a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably theirs, probably also carried in the trunk of the little Ford! <br /> <br /> And throughout the movie, we never see a gas station, nor anywhere else that seems to actually be able to buy gas. Most of the time, they cross desolate desert kilometers. So where did they find gas? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian movies, good or bad, but there are many that are better than that and very few are worse. Leave this one in the rack.
