This spinning movie is more like a combination of MTV music videos than a real movie. There is no real story, and over the course of the film you wonder, "What will happen?"; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people seem to have nothing in common: so why join them in a movie. With music, you can watch the worst movie. When I turn on the tap and Bach's music comes out with water, most people will like to watch it, but it's not a movie. The director must learn to write a script for a film of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a film.
