Ernst Lubitsch's latest film, completed by Otto Preminger after the untimely death of Lubitsch during production, is an act of sophistication and foolishness, romance and music, fantasy and costume. In a nineteenth-century castle in south-eastern Europe, a countess falls under the spell of her sworn enemy, leader of the Hungarian revolt. she is helped by her ancestor, whose painted image comes alive as if by magic. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig with flowers, has never been so beautiful and her songs are very enjoyable. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is flooded with different ideas that fail to fit in - or entertain. The results are beautiful, but not absorbent. * 1/2 of ****
