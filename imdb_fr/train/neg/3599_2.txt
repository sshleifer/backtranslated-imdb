Umm .. I was quite surprised to see that this movie earned him good grades. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie only proves the extent of her "talent." The plot of the movie was I bet the dork who proposed this concept was a perverse voyeur.If there is something positive in this movie, I would say it's Tommy Chong's daughter, just for the fact that she's her daughter ... and then there's that main male role of Soap-Opera-ish that's decent and beautiful makes her attractive, but stops helping her dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? many times can you simply say "This film is nil"?
