Five years after the first Creepshow, George A. Romero and Stephen King write another infamous horror sequel: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories are really original or distinguished either. The first story is a horror story, based on an Indian wooden statue in search of revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really good in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the owners of older stores. The second story, "The Raft," is a Stephen King story. It's about four teenagers who spend the day unknowingly on a pallet of wood in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, children scream for their lives like a drop of water does not let them enter any apparent reason. However, instead of being suspenseful, children are confronted with poor dialogue and thoughtless behavior, preventing us from really worrying about what will happen next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a retreaded tire re-tuned for Creepshow 2. Lucille Fletcher's original story was shot in 1953 as a black thriller movie. Then he was adapted for a famous episode of Twilight Zone starring Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-Hiker" works the best of these three offers, but it's not without problems either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up crushing a hitchhiker, to what she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many medium stories of this type, the characters exist only to tell the stories with their twists. The recap story with the bullies seems a little misplaced. Tom Savini appears as the "creep" in this slice. The good thing is that there was no more. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
