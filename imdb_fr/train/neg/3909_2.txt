When I discovered that there was a movie in which my favorite actresses were Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! Jeremy Irons (an actor I always admire even after this disappointment) played was awful. He treated his family like shit, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not be close or sympathetic to any of the characters and I am not prudish, but the sex scenes were really useless or they could have been mitigated. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have been developed much more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what was there with the character of Meryl and his "mystical powers"? Why did not they go further in this? This film had a lot of dead ends and the result is that it's a really ugly movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
