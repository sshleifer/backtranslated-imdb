From time to time, a movie happens so terribly that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my day and I can spare only one soul to watch this film, what joy will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to begin my discussion about pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We had swearwords, fat guys eating donuts, foreign fools, and so on. The script felt like it was written when the movie was shot. The value of the production was so incredibly low that I felt like watching a video presentation. Directors, producers, etc. have they ever seen a movie before? Halestorm gets worse and worse with each new entry. The concept of this movie seemed so funny. How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors? But believe me when I say that, things went wrong, VERY FALSE.
