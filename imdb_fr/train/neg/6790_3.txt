Ohhh brutality, ohhhhh the dying race, ohhhh the feeling of loss, ohhhh prejudice! God, when are all of you revisionists going to stop analyzing Westerns for shouting loudly? S ** t is coming. If it hurts your social sensibilities, find the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, tedious and very tedious loss of celluloid, especially due to the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here unless you're obsessed with 19th-century desert dentistry. Perhaps he would have been a little better without the constant hijacking of the irrelevant Mexican with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensibility of the 60s and 70s. Almost impossible to sit all the way through the movie I think I'd rather have my eyes open for the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10-all morter'n hell.
