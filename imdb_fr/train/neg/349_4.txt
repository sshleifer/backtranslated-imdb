A boiler if I ever saw it. A supposed thriller borrowing from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", even to a "In the Heat of the Night" reversed with a small murder upside down, to the "Strangers on a Train" it Abominably fails where all the above, to a large extent, has succeeded. Namely, delivering thrills. The plot seems to sum up from a larger book, making plot developments obvious and not implicit, while management lacks pace and verve. To control his congratulations, it was necessary to make a major shift in the process. Connery is clearly slowing down in her old age, barely bothering to try an American accent and looking too old to be Hope Lange's husband and father of her devil children. He even has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne is barely lucky enough to fill her role and you are confused from the start as to whether he is a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they do it, confusedly, here. The rest of the game is simply averaged by a reasonable cast in their stereotyped subscribed roles. The so-called climax also managed to roll, leaving me firmly anchored in the back, not as should have been the goal, the front edge of my seat. Bad sloppy Hollywood movie doing for sure.
