I still do not know why I forced myself to sit all that time. This "film" was not worth the DVD-R Memorex on which it had been engraved; I thought I was watching the final result of a group of college students stealing their parents' camcorder. This is by far the worst movie of all time. From the bottom of my heart, I really want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from me. <br /> <br /> So, apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However, if you find yourself in hell and you have to watch this 90-minute doo-doo series, you will see that Yamasato is really trying to make a great movie. The actors are trying dramatic performances comparable to those of Crimson Tide, but are getting closer to The Marine. <br /> <br /> The game of shit is only the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is at best in C-movie - the plot is not even good enough to be considered a B-movie template. The dialogue is dynamic and spiritual, but it's a shit like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the script actually attracts flies. Moreover, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the music plays in the background THE ALLLE TIME, acting as a subliminal reminder of the seriousness of the situation. I do not care what the disclaimer says, I do not buy it. BOTS was not deliberately done so badly, because he wants to be too serious for what he was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "film" had a very small budget. But that's not an excuse for his record sucking factor. The big films are born of the substance, not the budget. BOTS had neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> Allow me to express in more detail the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I had a three-way conversation with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood Samurai I would be out faster than Steven Seagal in the executive's decision. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, some people will try to defend the film. Two, maybe three. They'll say, "It's grindhouse chop-socky!" or "corny in the good sense!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. A movie is good or bad. There is nothing like a good bad movie. But there are idiots who like shit movies. Do not mistake yourself; There are a lot of movies you can not take seriously that are fun and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This end of the month party lasts about an hour and a half and, in my humble opinion, 90 minutes too much. The best thing about this "movie" is the jacket of the DVD. So, next time you approach the Wal-Mart DVD shopping cart, take a look at it - DO NOT TOUCH IT, just look - and move away slowly.
