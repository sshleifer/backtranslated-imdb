Wow, it could have been such a good movie, Starts of with Brittany Daniels tied up, I really think we're going to have a flash back, but nothing starts, the movie starts again with the kid's filming. This film would probably have been better if it had not been the role of actor. I mean the acting game was mostly horrible .. Although with the lines the poor actors have to deal with, I guess they did the best they could .. Again that really messes up the movie for me .. The twins were the only ones who seemed to have some acting skills .. The movie lags far too long for the supposedly shocking conclusion .. In total, I've seen worse movies on a budget, but since was a hype with the 8 films to die, I was very disappointed .. By the way, did some commentators say there was blood and other things. Did I see the same movie? Well, it's 4 out of 8, and so far only one has been good.
