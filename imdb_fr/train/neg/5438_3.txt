I'm quite a fan of the novelist / screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" has become a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he participated in the screenplay for "Spider Man 2", arguably the greatest comic film of all time. <br /> The director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed some great comedies, such as "Dodgeball" and the awesome short film "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like a no-brainer. <br /> <br /> This is the case. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster is played by Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte) recently graduated in economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works as a minimum wage earner at Book Barn, maintains a tasteless relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which is little more than a copious sex, without another plan that nibble a career for which he has no passion. <br /> <br /> A party night, a former roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful and smart violinist. Later in the night, they go out for a pie and she asks Jon a question that starts to shake him out of his catatonic state of existence: "I want you to tell me something you never said to one soul, if you do that, it will make that night indelible. "Jon then tells him one of his recurring dreams in which he walks around the city looking at the faces of strangers who cross him, but no between them does not look into his eyes. "I guess death must be felt," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, his wild boyfriend, Cleveland (Saarsgard), kidnaps Jon at work and takes him to an abandoned steel factory and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend every moment of their waking to surrender at punk-rock concerts, drugging and drinking a lot of alcohol. This is not good enough for Phlox, who pushes Jon to a more personal relationship, leaving her to meet new friends and his father. The film then tries to take us on Jon's journey as he gets rid of the chains his father, Phlox, imposes on him and his impasse when he finds freedom and expression thanks to his relations with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem for us to follow Jon throughout the film: he is totally uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He goes through life like the invisible specter he described to Jane the night they met. At first, it's not a problem. But it never becomes more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He just follows the Cleveland and Jane bohemians, but he never gives us the slightest idea of ​​what interests him or what he wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film and its main characters have nowhere else. go and do something other than party, have sex and argue. In other words, a lot of noise for nothing. What we have here is the superficial skin of a good film with nothing inside. Quick cinematography, heavy voice-over with characters in the distance, lots of straight and gay sex scenes, big arguments, angry sex, a hunting scene and a tragic death ... but that does not seem to have 'importance. Ironically, at some point, Jane, confused at a number of junk actions from Jon, asks, "What's going on, Jon? What's this?" Yes, Jon, say. We, the spectators, are dying to know. <br /> <br /> The title "The Pittsburgh Mysteries" should refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional replacements for real people. The film never lets us in. We never know what motivates them. We see them doing a lot of things, but we do not know why. And the lack of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
