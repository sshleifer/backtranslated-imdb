As a "loose Catholic" who had 11 years of Catholic school, but did not attend Mass for 35 years, except for weddings and funerals, I thought I would have a weak for that. And I did . . . for the first two thirds of the film. It was all that was standard - rigorous school teachings in parish schools, repressed sexuality, and so on. But suddenly, the movie has become mean. Really nasty. Now, notice, I saw this before the pedophilia scandals. . . and perhaps I would not have been so offended by such wicked and hateful digs at the Catholic Church if I had known about these abominations (a term so Catholic!) and their camouflage. <br /> <br /> In recent years, I rented the video and I will not come back to rent it with a new perspective. He just left such a dirty, nasty, ugly taste in my mouth. . . I wonder what experience all the actors had with the church, either because they really "hated" it or they were looking for the paycheck. It's an unbelievably anti-Catholic film, shocking for anyone who has a glimmer of respect for Catholic education. What I still do because there were no better teachers in the fifties. Whatever these nuns were, they forced me to learn to read and write English. They made us memorize. (How many children today can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) In truth, nothing is more essential to success in America. Can you read? Can you add / subtract / multiply / divide? Awesome. You can get any graduate degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will be very helpful to you, not only if you continue your studies, but for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic "mythology" we all had to learn. <Br /> <br /> Such a big distribution, a scenario as ugly and rotten. I feel really bad (and no, it's not "bad" - believe me, nuns taught me better) for the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project must have been those bad children (that is to say stupid) who sat in the back of the room, if they were willingly involved in the making of this film.
