It seems that many of the people who watched this film only looked at it first because it was shot near their home. How is it for a resounding endorsement? If this film was shot near my home, I would not mention it in my review. It's horrible! Several critics say that this film is a parody or pretentious horror film, it's neither one nor the other. It is sad to see this film seen as a comedy, which makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film, but also a comedy. But I laughed, how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This film has two good points: the mask and the weapon of choice, it would have unfortunately been more interesting to watch an hour and a half of the mask and the weapon resting on a table then looking this trash. The social commentary behind the film is also laughable, juvenile and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, you have already wasted time reading this review, do not waste time on this movie anymore. Arrggghhh! It's infuriating that movies like this one are even made. I was expecting all cast members to be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a movie because it is so bad. There is nothing that redeems in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on the rental and I felt ripped off. To avoid. 1 of 10
