I knew that 'Evening' was a girl movie, so I was expecting to be bored. A nasty tease on IMDb said it was a "chick movie" but your mate would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when we both went out, we were surprised to see that it only lasted two hours. The evening seemed a lot longer than that! I suppose, for Yanks, it's supposed to be fascinating because it's about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a large veranda and a lawn but no apparent lawn mower . If this kind of thing impresses you, it may sound like a short film. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about Monty Python about a knight who simply does not want to die. He finally squirms (why does Yanks add a third syllable to this word, I wonder) his torso on the road always shouting threats to his nemesis. This film also speaks of a kind of undead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the serious dodger shown here) continues to die while having an inappropriate guilt. She is not afraid of being a wide-eyed and breathless bimbo, but imagines herself to be a murderer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a female film, there is one guy who is supposed to be the character of Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff. I'm not a woofer, so I can not pretend to be a good judge of that sort of thing, but the tedious wimp that is hunted for this role seems to have only the servant title in its favor. It is a rag without bloodshed. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the main characters are not really cops, but the most minor ones manage to get worse. There is a guy whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is pregnant. All right, but that's not Hamlet's role - why block him so badly? Forgetting that it was a girl movie, I thought it was going to be thrown in the trash because any decent girlfriend would have told her that the fungus would not flatter her, but then I realized that she must have encouraged him to grow 'beard' because he looked worse without her. <br /> <br /> I stayed awake by noticing which actors and actresses had the lobes of their ears attached or free and noting pieces of interesting landscapes - if you are trained, see if you can see the teddy bear's head. Buffalo is exactly the kind of thing you expect in a beach cottage. <br /> <br /> Apart from the compulsory marriage, there is only one gesture. You would have thought they would have understood it. Unfortunately, the hit and run accident is committed by a car that could not be there. When the accident is discovered, the actors strive to shout for a character they can not know is nearby (but we do like the public). If they have no idea that the person is a few kilometers from the place, then why are they walking to shout aimlessly? I guess the director's excuse is that it would be a half-memorable dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another piece of d√©cor that caught my attention was a bottom-up pan of copper. I did not think the technology to do it was developed before the fifties.
