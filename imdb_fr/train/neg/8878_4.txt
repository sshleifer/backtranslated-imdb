Judy Holliday won gold in 1950 with the film version of George Cukor's "Born Yesterday". From that point on, his career consisted in trying to find the material that would allow him to hit the gold again. <br /> <br /> It never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I do not see a title blander passing), Holliday is still a variant of the silly blonde who may not be so stupid after all, but everything in this film seems warmed. and half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I thought was his first role in the movie, can not muster enough energy to animate this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning. He is waiting for the film to catch up. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're in love with Holliday, you'll enjoy this evening; otherwise I would not mind. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
