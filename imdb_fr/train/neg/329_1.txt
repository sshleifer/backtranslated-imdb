First: I bought it at the video store. Second: I watched it. Third: it was boring. Fourth: it was not funny. Fifth: Most antics were lame. And last but not least: it's not just a bad film, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Adam Sandler despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry because it was his first film. Even if you are a big fan of Adam Sandler, do not watch this movie. Take the video instead, hop aboard a yacht and throw it to the sea.
