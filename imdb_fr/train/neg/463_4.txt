Blonde and Blonder were not funny. Essentially, it was a female version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noise and music. It begins immensely boring and TOTALLY idiotic. It does not take rhythm so soon and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense continued. I found it a little fun and interesting as the end approached, but it was the only part. In addition, I could not help but look a little like the characters of Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard. from me, this caught my attention. I would not say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better movies for you to spend your time and money compared to Blonde and Blonder.
