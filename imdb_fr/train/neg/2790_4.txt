Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby, Alex, to spend a few days with his family on Savage Island, an island apart. The couple expects to solve their problems on the weekend on this isolated island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of squatters from hillbilly lives on the island. Imprudent Peter smokes the pot while driving the truck in the night and turns off the lighthouse to show; however, he accidentally hits the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark, he thinks he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex compensation for their lost son. The Young family does not accept trade and initiates a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie, with a stupid scenario, an amateur cinematography and a surprising quality of play. The wrong story is totally absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how could two men leave two single women with the baby on the road at night with the threat of the disturbed family? The logical procedure would be to go immediately to the mainland and get the police to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent, their house and their friends, and no one pursues them? Peter calls Alex's sister Julia when he arrives with the boat early. There are so many flaws in this movie that I could spend a lot of lines writing on this subject. I believe this film was filmed with such a horrible domestic video camera that the images are. Good distribution deserved better work equipment. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
