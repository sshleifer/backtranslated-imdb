Imagine taking off the mask of a deadly assassin and finding Barbara Cartland ... This is what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening has been promising, but it quickly loses all pretense of being a thriller (or even an imaginary love story) and the only reason they have told this story becomes very clear : fill a void in their female viewing market by creating a new reworking of "misunderstood and dark bad boy" (Andrei) and "innocent, whimsical beauty" (Paula). <br /> <br /> Rather than wasting all their time creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight to the booty: the naughty boy tamed by the whimsical beauty. From this follows a succession of love scenes that are not very sincere and very clichéd, strewn with pseudo-philosophical / poetic duvet. Andrei admits to being a (poet) poet to complement the perceived qualities that a Byronic hero should possess - but even when we are told in a heavy, underlined writing that is what he is and what he is, he is still hard to believe. - or care. <br /> <br /> For a Byronian hero / antihero to work, history needs subtlety, style and innovation, all of which are totally absent here. It's not a ghost of modern opera, it's exactly what happens when a weak and rather stupid woman (with a slick rubber band) unleashes a bad man who, after meeting, seems as dangerous as rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances may have saved this film, if they had been good: the main role of the woman is preoccupied with the sexy and 'supernatural', as forced as ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged as he crawls through his game. It's not his best job. The glimmers of interest were presented by Jürgen Prochnow under the name 'Vashon' and by Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother in the place.
