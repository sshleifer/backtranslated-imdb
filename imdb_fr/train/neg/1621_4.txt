"The Fox and the Child" is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who introduced us to the Academy Award-winning documentary "Walking Penguins". It revolves around a young girl (beautifully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her flourishing friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are really fascinating moments here; badgers walk, a lynx chasing the fox through a forest covered with snow; One scene in particular when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and sometimes frightening. However, there is simply not enough. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; cinematography is dazzling. The sparkling look of the film is wonderful. It is undeniably a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that already exists has been badly doubled. The score is also much too soft, or at least it's for my taste; and the scenario, while subtle, seems to go from one scenario to the other, leaving me almost perplexed. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful moral at the heart of the film and the rather calm performance of Noël-Bruneau is quite beautiful, the real star is the fox. These captivating moments focusing solely on our furry friend are extraordinary. However, again, there are simply not enough people. <br /> <br /> - To keep up-to-date with the latest film news, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray.com. com.au
