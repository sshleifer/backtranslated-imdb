How do I start? This film is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. He has no qualities that are redeemable to him. I sat there during this film and it was a struggle. that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this film was a failed attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure that's why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. wasted with this piece of shit. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, IT DOES.
