It's a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see scenes of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death, idling. The guy who did this then has his consciousness spiritually cleansed by the flames of the burial / burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, after being tortured to death. This is one of the sickest and slimmest movies I have ever had the displeasure to see. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn approach the finish line with their DYING animals, we are supposed to admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put the producers and the director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they're done, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
