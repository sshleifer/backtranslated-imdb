In addition to all technical errors .... <br /> <br /> What about an air hostess who is capable of killing only 4 out of 7 terrorists (including ex-sailors ), including 2 without even using a firearm. Then she landed the plane perfectly. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular flight attendant, scared, but very well composed. : D How about the leader of the assault / rescue team, who has an impeccable plan (according to the logic of the scenario) to gas everyone while sleeping and have the plane fly by a member of his team. It only decides, at the moment, to change plans and to carry out an attack against terrorists, firearms ignited, not knowing where the terrorists are, nor their number, and not having a benefit, so that his whole team gets easily annihilated. Yes, it's using the old noggin. Only later will you decide to use sleep gas anyway. And this is useless for intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Too bad this movie was, however, I could not help but watch and ask myself, and then? : D I can not help but imagine all the excellent unemployed writers who think in themselves, it's not fair. lol! :RE
