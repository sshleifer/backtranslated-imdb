The Minion is about ... well, a henchman. A servant of Satan whose goal is to obtain the key that will open the door where his master is trapped. He is a kind of demon that possesses human beings and when the body dies, he will have another. Anyone who is possessed will have a berserker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a Templar secret order, who is responsible for keeping the key away from the minion. The film begins a thousand years ago in the Middle East, where two Templars fled the minion. Then move on to 1999, where the key is somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist is appointed to study / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the henchman is after the key and the film becomes a chase scene between the henchman and Lukas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a low budget film for movie B. The film lacks energy and is making strides. You will follow the chase, but you will never feel involved in the story that voluntarily resumes the ideas of previous movies (especially the Terminator films). Combat scenes with the minion are awkward, since you never have a clue about the quality or quality of this demon's warrior. He becomes "deftly" a one-man army when he fights a Templar squad, but he is nil when it comes to an individual fight. And it's supposed to last a long time. All this shows that all logic is simply rejected for the sake of convenience. The idea of ​​a secret order of the Knights Templar, a door of hell and the key is not well explained. We just have to accept their existence. The film seems to have been created with the feeling that there is not much potential in history but just enough to earn a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren seems to wish he were somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
