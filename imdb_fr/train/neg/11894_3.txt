KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, I remember writing BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the cult director Honda; this one is not necessarily better ?? it's just that I learned to be more tolerant towards this kind of intrinsically low tariff! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually get two Kongs for the price of one: a lousy and silly giant monkey, and a robotic variant that looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he is shown fighting two other monsters, and befriends a trio of humans. Naturally, he falls for the blonde (and sweet) heroine; In fact, more fascinating is a femme fatale angry with the crazy and naughty genius of the film. called Dr. Who and sporting the anemic appearance and cloak usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes him to recover the element X which is encrusted in the frozen waste of the North Pole; apparently, the giant monkey is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, which will capture even its three "companions")! The female agent then changes her heart, helps the heroes (one of whom is typically American) and is murdered by Who. Kong eventually escapes and goes to Tokyo, where he will have a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor flees the chaos that ensues in his sous ?? which, at the request of Dreamgirl of Kong, is summarily ransacked by the giant monkey.
