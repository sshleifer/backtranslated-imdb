I have seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Now, I may have seen this film from the corrupted point of view of a theatrical director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure the people in the specific area of ​​ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical point of view, I found that everything from design to choreography was dull and did not match "cinematographic film". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be (sweets did not look like candies, rats did not look like rats but rather chocolate kisses), the acting was weak, maybe too soft for the screen, and the choreography did nothing for me. This makes the whole show very satisfying (at best), as if it were destined not to stand out from any other production. But remember, again, this is from the artistic point of view of a theatrical director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a straight theater director.
