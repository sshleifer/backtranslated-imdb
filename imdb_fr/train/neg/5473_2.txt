I had never seen one of these SciFi originals before, it was the first. I think it's fair to judge CGI's acting, direction / production, scenography and effects on other SciFi films. Comparing it to your typical Hollywood production is unfair. However, I would say that on the whole, the Aztec Rex did not exactly recall the masterpiece of Werner Herzog, Aguirre, Wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I will begin by noting that, yes, I recognize the fact that this film has more to do with the shock of cultures than dinosaurs. Although this is a sci-fi movie designed for television, there is an underlying context to the story I'm going to examine. The symbolic elements included are sufficiently obvious. <br /> <br /> Consequently, as a student in history, theology, mythology and film: I found the scandalous dialogue and the themes of the plot somewhat insulting. I do not ask for mea culpas on behalf of the producers - as I said before the film, that's what it is. But my concern is that a large part of the youngest population in this film is probably on television to teach them about history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is most visibly with the character. Ayacoatl (not a comment on Dichen Lachman's performance, but simply on how her character was written, though, I'll say she has work to do before receiving Emmy nods). It is by its character that the actions of Spanish Europeans are justified. Its function in the film as a love interest of Rios says that the European way is good, simply because they are European. There is really no other reason given. In reality, this is only to suggest that the viewer is supposed to associate with Europeans on the Aztecs because of their dress, their language, their ideology, and so on. they are more familiar than the Aztecs. The Aztecs are described as opposing and upside down. And it's not just that the viewer ends up with this hypothesis because of the viewer's ethnocentric perception, but it really seems that the story tries to convince the viewer - as if the Aztecs were not able to conceive a plan - if not better - to attract a dinosaur until his death on a bed of punji sticks. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, there is a subgroup of Spaniards who are described as looted temples and who intend to mistreat the native MesoAmericans. There is also a scene where the holy Christian man notes the achievements of the Aztecs: "They have agriculture, medicine, a calendar, etc." - But in the end, it is still the Aztec warrior who is described as the main antagonist of the film, even above the "lizards-thunder" (more information about this later). He is portrayed as a perfidious, duplicator and attempts to send the spanish romantic European by trapping him in the consumption of mind-altering hallucinogenic mushrooms - an important spiritual component in certain aspects and religions of the Mesoamerican and North American indigenous (still , more about this later) so that he can keep the woman he feels belongs to him and away from the Spaniard. <br /> <br /> Now, by analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving aside the obvious themes between Christians and pagans), a spectator can easily take these so-called lizard-thunderers as representatives of the Mesoamerican ideology / theology, which is described in this film as one of the objectives of: bloodthirsty, ruthless, cruelty, wicked, perhaps even pervert? In opposition, we have this group of wandering Christians, led by a young Hernando Cort√©s, portrayed as naive but generally noble lambs, caught in the dark and pagan world of the Aztecs. In addition, the name of the film is Aztec Rex, which suggests that they are dinosaurs that eat people. However, Aztec Rex is translated by Aztec King, the head of the Aztec state or, in this case, by "state of being". (Therefore, why the title of the movie has been changed). And then, who do we see as the new Aztec king at the end? This is the last Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to the new European ideology that has conquered, through disease, bloodshed, war and famine, the Amerindians. Rios symbolizes the ideal European - as would the presenters of this film (as opposed to Cortes who represents "the practical European but still so noble"). But if you look at the holocausts of the Americas, let's be honest: are not the symbolic components of the film's story retrograde? <br /> <br /> I must say that Aztec Rex is at worst a little racist, or to be nice about it, at best ignorant. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, I guess everyone wanted to be fun, but so in the end, we still have the idea that Rios is the father of the last Aztec lines? I wonder what the Mesoamerican natives would have to think about this end ... myself, I thought it was a bit too lenient. <br /> <br /> The best supporting performance of the film goes to Ian Ziering's wig - although Visibly - it at least has altered Ziering's appearance enough so that I do not think I was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a band of conquistadors to the heart of darkness. Ziering turns out to be a more than capable actor in this movie. I bought his performance, or at least I forgot that it was Ian Ziering anyway. I do not know who his agent is, but he should have more work. <br /> <br /> In closing, it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I have been a fan since his too brief performance in Scrooged, who stole the show from him. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
