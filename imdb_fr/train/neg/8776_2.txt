Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; in the films of Tim Burton Batman, he always falls in the shadow of his big bad guys. Here, he plays the role of a widowed husband who captures radio frequencies that look like dead who try to make contact with the living ... <br /> <br /> Well, it's supposed to be a thriller shocking enough, but it really misses all the places that shock you. Because there are too many things that are unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when the film is so badly shot in the first place that WHITE NOISE is a fool? Really bad actor and horrible edited, this movie has nothing to do. Michael Keaton tries a return to the thriller but misses more than ever his target.
