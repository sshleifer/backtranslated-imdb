THE DECOY is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the usual flaws that make most of these films flow. It has a precise history, the acting is adequate, the photography is very good, the hero and the villain are great men, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new DVD, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where all 10 come from, because this movie is not so good - even if you are the filmmaker's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw at the theater is Warner's on JK Rawlings' much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. Comparing THE DECOY to PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (from Warners) has no history, that the director did not allow the game to interpret the shoot, that the photography was appalling and that the dominant musical score was just a mess. I ranked Phoenix at "1" because the scale does not go lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, it's not "lure 3 - the Shootout" or such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not exceeded by the stupid "10" sheet music here, you could simply enjoy the film on its own terms.
