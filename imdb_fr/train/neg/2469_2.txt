I guess if you like endless dialogues that do not convey story and flashy camera effects like scene transitions in the _Angel_ TV show, you'll enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a pleasant and concise story, which was not there. The rhythm was practically backwards, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​useless dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of apprehension, or tension, or anything. <br /> <br /> Is it redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, he's a speedy cameraman. It's not scary. It does not generate any voltage or atmosphere notes unless you are scared by MTV. Like the critics that preceded me, I also found that at the end of the film, the film caused laughter from the public. <br /> <br /> Terrible film.
