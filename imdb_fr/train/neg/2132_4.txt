This film has tried to be too much at once: scathing political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, dark romantic comedy, promotion of family values ​​... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably, but the interest was enough to prevent me from extinguishing it to the end. Although I appreciate the spirit of WAR, INC., I am depressed to see such an event. awkward effort, especially when it will be caught by its targets to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than simply for the poor writing, direction and production of that particular film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism to make of the corporatization of war. But making fun of it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. It reminds me a little THREE KINGS, which trivializes in the same way a real cause for concern.
