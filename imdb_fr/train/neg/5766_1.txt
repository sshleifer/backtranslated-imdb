This was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that would cry out to the world media to take note, because we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our options to produce quality work with open tools source. After downloading the basic version (die hard fan here on a dialup modem), I finally got to my first problem. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and winamp failed to open it on my xp, and Totem, xine & kaffeine did not open it on my suse server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. It will be difficult to spread the word if normal users can not even open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and perfect texturing. Everything seemed real. And then the two main characters moved ... and talked ... And the film died for me. Apart from the lip sync and the actual animation of the two main characters (with the exception of Proog in the dance scene), it looked fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were so badly animated that I sometimes wondered if there were games on the market with less realistic cinematic scenes than this one. <br /> <br /> Any frame of the movie is fantastic .. like a frame, and the thing is awesome if no actor moves. I'm so glad I did not recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a plot that was easier to follow and cleverly crafted. <br /> <br /> This film would get 10 stars if it was not the tragedy that is right there on the screen.
