A mad scientist girlfriend is beheaded so he brings her back to life. Honest is the plot of the film. He tries to find another body for him, he seeks this perfect body through the streets of the city. For some reason, he has a very ugly monster in a closet in his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughable. No one in the movie can really act, including the head. The closet monster is a man with a mask tie and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the end is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me, I would not watch this movie alone.
