"Paula, maybe I'm a bitch, but I'll never be a butch!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in a rather tiring skin film that features a pretty honey in Stacey Walker, but that's about it. This girl is a real tease who attracts her boyfriend, her colleagues and even her lesbian roommate Paula in her bedroom, but then turns into a job that screams "to rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified c is interesting for maybe a bit, but this story eventually turns into a real repetitive case of a note. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who will still take care of that moment.
