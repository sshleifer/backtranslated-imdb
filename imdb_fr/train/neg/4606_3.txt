This film was an attempt to go to places that most do not and perhaps should not venture. It was a similar trial to the bizarre and decisive perspective that was given to us in The Cell, but not as detailed and detailed. The plot is built simply with an initial campy sensation. Then, while the film takes its turn supposedly "dramatic", the plot falls apart on the few legs on which it had to be held in the first place. <br /> <br /> The idea is essentially that of a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He assumes the role of a successful man, killing an accountant of the city. Then he will not be paid for his work but will be tortured for several days because he imagined the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file he had as a means of payment. This silly attempt to try to force them to fail him because he is horribly and endlessly abused. He starts to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he has paid for his sins and can start again, he visits the woman (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and earns his affection. Shortly after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes and revenge spreads through the air as the boy chases his executioners (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "kindness". <br /> <br /> I must ask, but what is it with Kari Wuhrer and the horror / bloody movies? <br /> <br /> It seems that all she has recently published has been in this genre. Certainly, I liked her in "Freaks on eight legs" and she was fine in "Anaconda". But despite all her kindness and allure (wow, she's hot!), She can play much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just a misconception. For all guys, you can see his "complete" in this film, although it's rather weird and short-lived. I almost felt that she had made soft-porn after watching this movie (something that was no stranger to Kari's career). The sexual simulation is such that it should cause you to wonder what is really happening during the shoot. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will say that there is good acting. Do not expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems destined to second that of his brother Alex. However, the film highlights some former big names, George Wendt (Norm de Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job by portraying the main character, Sean Crawley. His small acting experience and yet his credible nature as a young naive bring elements of substance to the film. <br /> <br /> I would not want to go out of my way for this one. If you are bored and tired of the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker", then I would advise you to look at this. <br /> <br /> And Kari, start playing in better movies!
