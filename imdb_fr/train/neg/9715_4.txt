This program is really overestimated. A detective like Danny Pino's hard-headed character would have been transferred to the "Rubber Firearms Brigade" years ago. The whole team is made up of selfish legal people, who judge people whose actions date back several decades from 2007. Every Vietnamese veteran he has ever had became the killer, unless it's another Vietnamese veteran. There was only one black murderer, and his white leader manhandled him. The only Hispanic murderer was a "race traitor" who killed another Hispanic to convict a Hispanic street child for a crime committed (of course) by two rich white children. What a band of propaganda. Hi the writers: the minorities and the poor also commit murders. Most murderers are whites of the upper class. <br /> <br /> In addition, the arrest of people aged 70, 80 and 90 for crimes they committed 50 to 60 years ago is a joke. In reality, no prosecutor will press for murder, as it means that the state will be required to pay huge medical bills until it finally kicks. The state would be of service to their families and their insurance companies. The prosecutor will simply plead them for manslaughter and they will not serve one day The only real criminals who go to jail are personalities of organized crime or ex-Nazis, whose well-known convictions energize DA's career.
