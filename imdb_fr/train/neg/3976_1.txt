The plot was dull, the girls were disgusting and the so-called Italian man had clearly never heard an Italian accent. Someone said that the boys were cute in this film, but that the group seemed filled with mediocre people. This movie literally contains no redeeming element. <br /> <br /> I think it's a graveyard for actors who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason. <br /> <br /> I hope that the Olsen twins will find something out of the spotlight to keep them away from the entertainment industry. They have no place.
