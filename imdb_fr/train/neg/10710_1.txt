An archaeologist discovers Dolph Lundgren as a templar who arrives in New York. An archaeologist has discovered a key that opens the anti-Christ. Of course, the demon is only a few miles away from Dolph and is not killed so easily when he passes from one body to another. body. (Like Fallen without the suspense) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely unassailable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies every time they are on television. I caught the Minion and I was disappointed. This movie is really terrible. With such badly organized and poorly edited action sequences, you can hardly have a consistent meaning in the battle arena. The worst of all is Lundgren's unconvincing performance as a hard priest (!). All this got worse, the movie being such a rip off from Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad but better than this one) overall This movie is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. He literally has nothing to recommend. It's awful and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, the last warrior and the masters of the universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (bad)
