This film is a confused mix of recent cinema clich√©s. There are some promising ideas out there, but while the director was clearly aiming to end up with a haunting film of ambiguity, it resulted in a confusing mess. The main actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without a central theme, it looks like he does not have much to work on. In addition, the film is largely devoid of fear (although, in all fairness, there are terrifying moments in the middle of the drudgery). <br /> <br /> a separate twin, devilish librarians, ghostly interests, confusion of identity, death by wild monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality and criminal gang relationships. The only real commonality between these elements seems to be that they lead the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that, even if the death of the brother, caused by monkeys, is strongly emphasized on the jacket of the DVD, the act - is not directly described. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be archival footage of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological and ambiguous tale of horror, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
