Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been discussed many times in countless films. Higher Learning stands out by the fact that it addresses the problem of racism in the most firm and predictable way possible, ah yes, it is also at the university. <br /> <br /> This film deals with this problem of racism, as Frankenstein deals with most problems, it hits you in the head brutally and slowly. Most of the characters are caricature cartoons (lesbian feminists, angry black men), caricatures that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes, this film is overpopulated with them. Angry blacks feel cheated, feminists hate men, and so on. (A feminist even holds a sign saying, "Dead men do not make fun of you." Do you see what I mean?) I do not want to give in, but film, if someone looks like a loner or a rapist, it will probably behave exactly as you wish. The changes that the characters undergo seem obvious to everyone, except for the characters in the movie. The big rebound in the plot depends on whether violent neo-Nazis will behave like violent neo-Nazis. I guess you'll just have to look to find out what's going on. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this film is that it's supposed to be "grainy" and "hard-hitting", but they make the Nazis the bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are mean, but that's what I mean. Everyone thinks the Nazis are mean. we do not innovate here. The Nazis have been described as villains since the 1930s. The film does not dispute any point of view and does not make bold statements. It only deals with problems that we all know in a clumsy, special after school way, like. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not really a tough stand on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher education is predictable, caricatural and, in a word, stupid. Avoid at all costs.
