I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening. Despite the fact that I did not pay a cent to see this movie, I always felt ripped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film, you leave a Benjamin in your seat. The acting is at best torpid; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst imitation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to have realized that he had made the wrong choice by leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones as long as necessary to pull that turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity. it looks like she's reading her lines with a prompter. And if you can not spot the "mole" in the first 20 minutes, you have just landed on this planet from a world without television or recycled story lines. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In the Line of Fire. If you see and buy in this one, you will begin to fear for the safety of the president because the secret services look and act like the adult versions of the 90210 genre. Whatever your feelings about W, let's hope this. " art "does not imitate life.
