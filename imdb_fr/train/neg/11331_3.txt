In spite of all the lack of respect for this "epic" of George Stevens Sr. of misfires and erroneous readings, I can only wonder if the "legend" of James Dean could survive this exit. harvest of its own "gigantismoses". Rock and Liz were not better off. Let's just say that "Dallas" televised was the authentic "heir", even if contemporary "Texans" (today) like Lay and DELay, not to mention our putative "president" of those states under the reign of the colony under the look of Amourrika, play an overbidding of ignoble global dimensions. I have never read the original Edna Ferber, but I will say that it is superior to what is presented on the screen. And all those well paid people, I guess, "supporting" brand and celebrity actors notwithstanding, "Giant" is, at least for me, a meager award, not to mention promotional campaigns.
