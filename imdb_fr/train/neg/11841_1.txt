What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Formerly a brilliant director, a pioneer ... is scratching the bottom ... Is this the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here, it takes a pretty interesting premise (although wacky), and turns it into bubble gum that loses its flavor as soon as you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is a bad idea of ​​Chaplin and all the others have been thrown for their "looks", and not because they were right for the game. Pity. I'm going to rent "Paper Moon" again.
