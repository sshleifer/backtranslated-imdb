I saw the movie and got it, because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought ram gopal varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was spoiled and they ruined "sholay". the casting and the team were bad. all the theater was sleeping watching the movie, some people fled in the middle. The acting of Amithab Bachan is mediocre, I thought that this film would be the biggest success of the year, but this film would be the biggest flop of the year, of course. nobody has done justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. this film does not deserve any audience. I bet this movie will collapse. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY, THIS FILM WANTS"
