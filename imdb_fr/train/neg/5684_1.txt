garbage misdirected. a poor nihilistic sadistic gorefest ... if you're the kind of person who likes it ... see a shrink. even if you are that person, that does not make this movie a good movie, the acting is really mediocre, the story full of intrigue, the director should give up and find a real job because he has no talent for this one. I can see why people do not like Uwe Boll .. we've had some of his movies lately and it's the best of them, which is really sad! A total absence of humanity seems to be appropriate for some people, but here it just creaks. Horror movies can be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good to watch when there is nothing else on ... SEED is really really poor.
