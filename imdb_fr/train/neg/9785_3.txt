This film, for a special after school, is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing is happening. You feel like you're still in class. A guy teaches a group of young outsiders how to be good paint ball players. We never see these outsiders fend for themselves, the good player training them. Suddenly, they become good players while meditating. In addition, there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on the other children. It might have been like a "Bad News Bears" (the original) since there was a girl in a boys-only team, but the movie was not sensational. It has no sensation and leaves a dull ache in your bones after looking at it, it's not fun to waste time or look, and it's just a little ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you would watch after classes before your nap. As boring as the day is long and the day was long watching this movie.
