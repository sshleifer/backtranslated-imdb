Tenants Two writers have trouble completing their books in an almost empty building. They help each other first, then the tension between them begins to rise slowly. <br /> <br /> It's based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and, unfortunately, everyone speaks as if it were in this novel. Very little dialogue is natural, its purple and full of nuances of meaning. It's as if a major English student with a head full of pretensions has written the script. It's awful and I found myself instantly safe from all that the film had to say, which is a shame because the film is full of remarkable performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog is good, unfortunately none of them can conquer the falseness of the words and the premise. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. Although not really bad, it is very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to go. I lost interest less than a third of the way and had to fight to get to the end. If that interests you, I would try cable, but I would not have much money to see it.
