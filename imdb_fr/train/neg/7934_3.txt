A family traveling to their daughter's softball league decides to take the "scenic route" and finishes in the middle of nowhere. The father is a passionate photographer and when he hears about an old abandoned side show in the city, he decides to make another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is filled with half-blooded monsters, who quickly kidnap women and let the young son and father fend for themselves. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing about this movie is how the family is fighting against its kidnappers. Apart from that, the film has no value.
