In the 1970s, when I first saw this, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now, as an adult, I think back and I say to myself ... yes, okay. What was so funny? He has his moments but they are few and far between. It's so dated that the jokes do not hold anymore. Show this to a younger audience and they will be totally lost. If you like that kind of humor, you can stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision as well as Groove Tube are too dated to be viewed today.
