I'm glad some people liked it, but I hated this movie. There was a very good idea for a screenplay, but that's where it ended. It was badly written, misinterpreted and poorly done. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting points, but they were ignored too quickly. The authors therefore had to know what to keep and develop on this information, such as lying about why she was kidnapped, and giving up slag. Instead, it was "What's going on?", 5 seconds later, they tell you. <br /> <br /> This film did not have any suspense and I was bored from the beginning to the end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go rent misery, or the best plans imagined if you want a suspense or twists that prevent you from guessing.
