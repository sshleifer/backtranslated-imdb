Having no affinity with any type of filmmaking and a good appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself for bothering to sit for the entire "20 dates" . I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. I will say, however, that Berkowitz's hyper narration to Woody Allen was extremely annoying. You want him to raise the coffee, or he ingests tranquillizers. And it is potentially self-evident to Berkowitz that this film was a bad idea, in part because it describes his essays to fund the documentary. Forgive me for hiding insults in the form of compliments, but I want to thank Berkowitz for having the skills to convince an idiot to finance this horrible piece of ****. I appreciate the limits and the intentions of the film here, but even with regard to the standards that Berkowitz sets, it shoots and misses on all levels. In conclusion, I am sure that many of these companions were uncomfortable for a date with a filmmaker dream, and I question the meaning of authenticity of the film. Hey Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
