I love 80s slasher movies and I remember the day when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was removed from our theaters. I was very disappointed. So I was very excited to see some of these movies on Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what I expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was laughable by today's standards, character development too long, but overall it was funny to laugh! <br /> <br /> The scenes where he loses it because Santa Claus, aka dad, feel moved by his mother and later, when the crowd is actually lit, lighting torches - not flashlights like in the 80s, but real torches! - really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes where he watched the children in his neighborhood gave me a terrifying feeling of a different nature. I also liked trying to understand who some of these actors were. It took me a moment to understand that the main character was the adorable Brothers teddy bear.
