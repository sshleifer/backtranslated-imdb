I can not objectively consider this film. It's not that I have not tried it, but I sit down and go into the old VHS, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly, I'm five years old and I'm holding my own Care Bear and watch the movie with open eyes and an impatient heart. <br /> <br /> I can see, objectively, that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of mascots and baby mascots hug uninteresting animation. But my five-year-old says, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So, I would recommend this film (with caution, reluctantly) to those who saw it in their youth and who can appeal to the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR to these adorably cynical Gen-X / Y -ers who deliberately seek the wonderful / strange (a category to which this film ... definitely belongs). For those who are really looking for a captivating movie or healthy family entertainment: You may want to keep looking.
