I have now seen this movie twice and I must say that I enjoyed it both times. It's fast and fun, but ultimately silly. That said, it deserves to be trashed for spoiling what could have been a good sequel to the original original. It is clear to those who have seen the terrible "Zombie Creeping Flesh" that the huge flaws of the film may be due to Bruno Mattei and that the little commendable about it can be due to Fulci. This is not Fulci's sycophany, the styles of directors are very contrasted and you can tell who directed what, especially in the case of Mattei. <br /> <br /> The film is centered around the outbreak of viruses As a "secret" by a scientist, his secret is apparently more remarkable than its potentially apocalyptic effect on humanity) somewhere in South Asia -Is. The virus causes zombie-like behavior in those affected, and the virus spreads rapidly across a seemingly arbitrary area of ​​land. Our protagonists wander involuntarily into the danger zone and must fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be stuck halfway between being a gore zore movie, and a back-and-forth action adventure, and this confusion is most clearly captured by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular variety without soul and without mixture, so well rendered in the original, and probably the creation of Fulci here. The other main group includes those who, infected with the virus, lost their sense of identity, but suffered a savage assault and desire to win a black belt in ninjitsu: it is undecided not to know if Need to continue to hone their technique engage with their brothers in what looks like a mass tickling party on their unfortunate victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talents either. They perfectly master the guerrilla tactics, hide on rafters and hay bales and sometimes fall inexplicably from nowhere except from the sky themselves. That's definitely Mattei's job. <br /> <br /> There is a third variety of zombies, more talkative. Apparently, this guy also has a sense of irony: "I'm really thirsty ... FROM YOUR BLOOD". The ridiculous turn at the end, in which the DJ turns into a zombie but continues to preach teen gibberish about the fate of humanity, only serves to reinforce the WTF factor and erase any hope of a serious resolution. <br /> <br /> there is the famous zombie head that slowly propels itself in the air, a wacky skeleton smile on the face, as if to say "yes, we know how bad it looks" . <br /> <br /> The characters are one. dimensional as one would expect. But it's the pseudo-comic dialogue and dubbing that prevents us from taking their problem seriously. That said, the first soldier to die shows an impressive courage against an imminent threat of zombies. Indeed, this is the first and perhaps the only time we have played real agro zombies, and one of the only effective scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> The guy who played the chief scientist has heart, but no talent, using breaks in his lines entirely at random, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' attempts to find an antidote on the screen are not convincing: we will now combine these two molecules! <br /> <br /> However, there are some moments that prove to be really effective. In a recent scene, a protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Entering a room, we are faced with a blurred view of a character changing in the corner and a mass that squirms on the ground, all shot in a diffused atmospheric light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a zombie handled with the fast machete that breaks everything in its wake in its alarming desperation to have it. His extreme aggressiveness is one of the rare moments of real horror of the film. The theme before and after carried by the hotel which hosts the events of the first phase of the epidemic, then as a refuge for our protagonists, is imbued with a thick and humid atmosphere. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a closed room that clearly houses hordes of undead, which is very tense. Things get more dramatic when they board the hotel without realizing what's on the floor. But this is poorly managed and is not as effective as it could have been. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would say that this film may be worthy of being dubbed royal duck a potentially effective tropical zombie festival. , rather than just a bad film from start to finish. If nothing else, there are many involuntary laughs that I expect from just about everything that is Italian and bloody from the eighties.
