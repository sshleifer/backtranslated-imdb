I watched this movie after having so much trouble downloading it via Rapidshare. And I must say that it did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so excited that I could not wait to watch her. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, but rather inspired by the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from America. Management has often lacked quality, with the exception of a few intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I'm 100% sure they will make it a breathtaking movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It just was not good enough.
