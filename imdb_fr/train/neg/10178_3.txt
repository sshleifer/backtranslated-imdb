How did I ever appreciate this failure of a sequel? He's just throwing balls! Even worse, it does not even compare to the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where have all the involuntary laughter gone? Enough action on the ground lasts too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a full nine-run game. And then MAJOR LEAGUE 4: BACK TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, could be! Leave it on the shelf and plan a trip to the star game. This one had three strikes too much.
