102 DALMATICS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a ridiculous and padded story, terrible for Glenn Close, who plays every scene as if she were playing for her. his own amusement, and unbelievably borrowing and uninteresting main actors. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and it's a stretch. Another effort wasted here. Rank: D
