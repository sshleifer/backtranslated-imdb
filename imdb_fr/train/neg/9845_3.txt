!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> As I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN, I could not believe it had been done in 1993 because it looked like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone of the mid-80's That begins with a murder and he remains to the public to meditate "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his lawyer?", But halfway through, the film shows his references from the early 90s in turning into "Lawyer gets manipulated and followed by his client" type movie that ends in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous ending in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us the drama of all time classic of the courtroom 12 ANGRY MEN
