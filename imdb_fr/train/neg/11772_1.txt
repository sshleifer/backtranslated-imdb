I will be brief ... This film is an embarrassment for everyone except his director of photography. The very fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are "treated" by a persistent dance scene. The plot is ridiculous, except the most ardent fan of BAD horror who will derive the least benefit. And for God's sake, stop saying that this movie is a story of lost innocence or even feminine empowerment, because that's clearly not the case (groping lesbians, what the heck?). it was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even collapsed mid-way, probably because he could not take any more. it may sound like a critical criticism, but I really can not find a redemptive feature of this film, except perhaps if you consider it pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed by a cocktail of class A drugs.
