I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love him? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield and Stanley Donen; all the icons in their own way. However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined everything for me. His game was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw open, not believing my eyes or ears. I could barely go through a single visualization. That's how ugly it is in this area. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in beautiful dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously have a balloon. The support cast is going well, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its elegant retro splendor. <br /> <br /> Next, you see Suzy Parker trying to speak her lines with a woodsy spirit, an impasse, an ignorance that simply defies belief. Who told this creature that she could ACT? Oy VEY, people.
