This film is massively boring and pretentious. It's been a while since a sailor shaves Mr. Barney's eyebrow (think of what's wrong like a purple dinosaur). The music is ruthless. It is sad to see that Bjork, a woman of such inner beauty, has been reduced to a false pretense in her art. The tea service pump gives the impression that a beautiful ritual is tasteless. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are raised. Not just Japanese culture, but another filmmaker ... (stay tuned) In a perfect moment "art imitates life", the ship's crew finds a giant piece of sea. What did the audience find in the theater? There are very composed and heartless pieces of art --- so get ready for the spoilers - I'm talking to you, Mr. BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you have been overwhelmed! I saw the sacred mountain of Jodorowsky. And your thin BS dummy veil has been lifted. You have stolen your images, your style and all your art catalog from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has finally come out, let's hope that the powers of the art councils of the world will STOP FINANCE YOU! Poor Jodorowsky-lost in a financial battle with the Lawyer Beatles when he is the Lennon / McCartney of the cinema. And besides, while Jodorowsky is the Beatle, you are the monkeys! A thin, soulless, cheap swindle that is appreciated only by easy, kitschy first-year students. And besides I am a filmmaker. If you are interested in a reality film, I will legally fight you in a Jodorowsky defense ring.
