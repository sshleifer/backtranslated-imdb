I did not expect much from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than nothing. A user comment on a line - a second-rate action movie - did not sound too damning for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered to watch this film if its score was less than 5.0 but hey, the film had a score of 5.9 out of 10, which seemed to me rather acceptable for this type of production . <br /> <br /> I now understand that the 37.5% of people who rated this movie a score of 10 (excellent) were clearly a publicity stunt, because DETENTION is the usual nonsense of Nu Image that you have seen before. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince a former soldier to become a history teacher assigned to a difficult school. His game is simply terrible, without emotion and artificial. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquent children. Compared to Lundgren, they look great just because they look natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION contains elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low-budget film - a closed film High security high school for the weekend, four teenagers detained with a veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, clichés and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a couple in love with Bonnie and Clyde and deliver the most acceptable performances of the film, although it seems to be a budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a Milla Jovovich want be. In a film where everything fails, their madness and style give me enough fresh air so that my interest does not fall back to zero.
