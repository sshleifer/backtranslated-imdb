I simply do not understand the big premise of this episode: the fact that Miranda is so remarkable and that there is something so ugly that would drive you crazy. Someone here commented that maybe it was the frequency of light waves or something like that rather than being ugly. Miranda is just a fool. The episode is slow, inconsistent and much too talkative. I do not quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does not the Federation leave this bloody Medusa behind? There is one aspect that I like when Kolos talks with Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and, even in its lightest form, I will always give it. This episode - mmm, I would not buy it, except for a used copy of less than $ 3.
