It's cheese. If all you want is a video game, with what looks like sequences cut directly from the computer, for which the film was too cheap to create special effects, that's all. My friend and I really had a good time seeing it, as the theater was almost empty and we could heckle a bit. This film REALLY requires heckling. <br /> <br /> Plot? There was a plot? Okay, some dumb guys from college or a later type are invited to "praise of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If they had stayed in Seattle, they would have survived. "- direct quote, or almost.) to attend. They get there and everyone is gone, and the site is a bit crumbling (but hey, the keg is always full!). With the help of an old crusty captain and a Coast Guard woman (who acted only slightly weaker and worse than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight with a lot of zombies (some of which spit 'acid), get a lot of weird legends and mostly get killed. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Demonicus, but not much, and better than Severed (they're kind of my own alpha and omega for bad movies - the first is bad but fun to heckle , and the latter is just too terrible to watch more than once). By cons, if you're waiting for a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil, run away !!! run away now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): Since when did 18th century Spanish ships venture into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is someone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling firearms and to whom - CANADA, for shouting loudly ??? Why a rave on a non-named (oh, excuse me, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) the island of San Juan - and outside, always keeping in mind it's the PACIFIC NORTHWET. And the rave has about 30 people present - "the rave of the year", what he tells me. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are a lot of axes around. Many of them. Everyone has them. Must be a point of sale nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the movie started playing with a little "parody" (with a nudge in I know what you did and Jaws), it did not carry out . quite close. <br /> <br /> OK, really finally - when the introductory comments (in a voice-off, no less) casually mention that one of the characters "has abandoned his boyfriend to focus on his fencing" you You may know that there will be fencing at the end of the film. Not good fencing, but some people who prick each other with swords, anyway.
