This film manages to be one of the most unique films you've ever seen. However, this comes from the fact that you can not make the head or the tail of this mess. It almost looks like a series of challenges put in place to determine whether or not you are ready to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel offended, you will go through this horrible movie and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved. They have all seen better days, but you realize they have actually paid enough. do this and you will lose the pity for them as you have done for the movie. I can not say enough about this horrible film, it's almost something that Ed Wood would have done and in this case, it would surely have been his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> For starters, you have to go through an open dialogue that you have never seen / heard, it takes five minutes. In addition to this, it is reported, so as to suggest that the viewer does not know how to read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines begins, it's as if he was only acting to get lines on the slogan of the movie poster. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I generally enjoy very much, and he does his best not to drown himself in this situation, but on the contrary. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing a clever role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and, in one way or another, she still gets roles in movies, even if she should stick to American-type movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, you might want to see this for yourself when it comes out in video, I know I had a crush, I mean, let's all honest here, sometimes it's comforting. to revel in the faults of others.
