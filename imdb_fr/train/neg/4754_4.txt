I liked the original. It was brilliant and always will be. Oddly, I was really looking forward to seeing the reshuffle. I am usually a little against re-make because there are too many, but one way or another, it intrigued me. I really enjoyed that to start. Caine shining, as usual, and Jude Law managing to hold is clean next to him. It was pretty smart how it was modernized and it worked. What prevents it from being really good is the last seven minutes. It moves away completely from the original, that is to say that it stops being clever and becomes annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! There was so much tension and it was incredibly smart! This? It does not grow in tension but in frustration as they seemed to have decided to make Caine's character a homosexual. It was if they tried too hard to be different. And then ... BANG! Law is dead. Roll Credits. This film is worth the detour just for the performances, but the last seven minutes really drag it. What a pity....
