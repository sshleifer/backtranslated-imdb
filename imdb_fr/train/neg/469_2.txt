Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it ... but it's obvious that somebody over there had some sense when the powers that disavowed it of this celluloid mess ... stupid ... and the only reason he gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of his clothes and we get a nice bullet in his chest ... I never thought I'd feel sorry for Ralph Macchio in this movie, but I do it ... and I really feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have appeared in this piece of ... movie ... at least, M Leibman had the cajones for refusing to put his name anywhere in the movie ... and he goes out in front ... there are actually copies of this thing with Mad's always beginning sequence on it ... if you can locate one, grab it because it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing to pro pos of this movie that is worth anything ... and a note to the people of IMDb.com ... there is no way to ruin this movie anyone ... the makers spoiled it by themselves ...
