First of all sorry to have even awarded a score of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). The film fails in all departments, be it the script, the realization, the characterization or the acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin, the name of the movie is really a C class (although the movie itself corresponds to the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan does his best to be at the height of the character, but his weak scenario associated with a pathetic direction ends up making it a humorous character. 3) In Sholay, Gabbar Singh has 50,000 awards (which was convincing). Here in Aag, the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had few motorcycles to go through (with all the automatic guns). similar to Sholay in Mumbai, in modern times does not seem convincing 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone must tell him that she does not know how to play. Why does Ram Gopal Verma reject her again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good but he has practically nothing to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, excellent actors, are wasted in the film. 7) The role of legend played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this film by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu, please, grow up and understand that there must be an intellect in your movie. Enough stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything modern about Jai and Veeru..promptu to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this film because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Please do not waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which, in my opinion, was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this awful bunch of stupid characters, bad songs and a miserable direction. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
