Seriously - avoid this movie at all costs. I just saw it in my first "preview" and although I paid non refundable money, I came out of the cinema after only 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion between my friends to know if we should leave or not. The first time I came out of a movie. And I lived very bad. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that is nicknamed (and badly) even though it is presented in its original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the Army ("What do we do once we reach the combat zone?" - "You get out of the car and die" - in fact, it's a lot more fun to read here than the way it was been delivered in the film), drugs (a guy eats "cookies from space", behaves really foolishly and misses his marriage or has to survive it at any time - everything is poorly written and misinterpreted) intention of women in the army ("Why do we only have trumpets? We were promised weapons!" - "It's like that, that's how it'll stay") ... Argh. Okay, you might actually find it really funny, but in that case, you make me very scared. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have seen better play in the genre of soft porn movies that you receive on European television late at night. So, he had lame jokes (poorly delivered), beyond the lower average, lack of rhythm, was badly dubbed and edited ?? It just did not work. At least at no level used as a measure for movies. <br /> <br /> I would be bold enough to say that this film proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny than the Germans. And it says something if you like stereotypes. (What I do not like is nice to play with them, though, just in case someone thinks I'm not PC enough). <br /> <br /> Instead of going to see this movie, do something useful. Try to teach shrimp hook, paint your nails in a really irritating color, disassemble your bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, convert to a different religion, and come back - in fact, listen to "Last Christmas" by Wham! on endlessly repeat. Anything, but do not look at this horrible movie.
