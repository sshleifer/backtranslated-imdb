First, I really enjoyed Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2. This movie was a real trash. I could not bear to watch him. The scenario was a joke, the acting was a joke and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> We go from Voodoo to DEATH 1 People come back to life. Anyway, this film is not worth the $ 1 it cost to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci's movies but this one was awful. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 are going to be, I think I will just ignore them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is an awesome cop.
