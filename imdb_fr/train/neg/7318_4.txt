It's a depressing, superficial, na√Øve and generally uncomfortable look at an incredibly unlikely relationship between Brooks' psychotic film editor and his tasteless girlfriend, Harold. Both have a ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything but be pretty at this stage of his career; but also because the character of Brooks is neither interesting nor sympathetic. At first, there are 15 minutes static and atrocious in which Brooks, who has just broken with Harold, stumbles on his apartment in a depressed and drugged - unbearable. <br /> <br /> A cheerful and unimaginative book by Joe Cocker "You Are So Beautiful", there is simply not enough material for a feature film. There is virtually nothing on the periphery of their relationships to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to turn the spotlight on the case and, in a way, to deconstruct it. but if you want to do that, writing and acting must be much better than they are here.
