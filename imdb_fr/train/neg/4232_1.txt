Karl Jr and his father are now leading an army on an isolated island. They capture a trio of guys falling on the island. After a while, who defends himself. (well the survivors) This one has blood, blood and nonstop carnage, which would have been nice if one of them looked really real, or if the production did not have the seems to have been made with weeks of money-saving meals (I'm perhaps over excited, it was probably a few days). The horrible dubbing did not bother me so much and I suspect that if I had been really drunk, some of them MAY be slightly humorous ... maybe. But in the current state, at 78 minutes, the film was still too long. Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and trailers for other Shock-o-Rama movies released
