I saw this recent film by Woody Allen because I am a fan of his work and I make a point of trying to see everything, even if the critics of this film have led me to hope for a disappointing effort. They were right. It's a confusing movie that can not decide if it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the mid-life crisis. He fails all three. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless mature woman who married and possesses great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two grandchildren . This rather trivial conspiracy concept is driven by improbabilities such as an old Chinese healer who makes her invisible with magical herbs and the ghost of an old lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions seem too fantastic, why not something more prosaic, like a saxophone connection? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this ambiguous confusion was trying to say. There are only a few really fun moments in the film, and the finale is a really nonsense touch of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Rent 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a beautifully done movie that combines comedy with serious ethical and moral considerations. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
