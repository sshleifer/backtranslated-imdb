For me, each piece of art must be judged according to these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to devote itself to forms: beautiful shots and sometimes interesting game. The long, close-ups suggest a function that the viewer can fill himself. Because of the lack of texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introverted person suggests having depth, but sometimes he has nothing to say. This film acts as an introverted person. If you have not read the synopsis, you can not see that it's suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) That changes Anna's vision of life and makes her suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me? Sebastiaan asks. Anna does not answer, she only starts to look at him without saying a word. What is the function of this shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What does this film have to say? What does this film mean? The answer for me: it shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their life is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic done, but meaningless without having the provision of "instructions for use". In my opinion, this film is made for other artists, not for the viewer.
