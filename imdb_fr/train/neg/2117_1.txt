The brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to understand why and how it happens, and they can not stop it from happening. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this because he extracts the cerebrospinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his old wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities understand that someone must be responsible for the deaths and disappearances, but they can not understand the improbable motive. Just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and move on ... If you manage to overcome the first twenty minutes of this mess, you'll be treated as if Lugosi was lashing his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the wives that he murdered, explaining that he finds him sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror movies (the kind of budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a reporter follows the culprit (and remarkably the unfit police are nowhere!), And the entertainment really begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are acceptable. There are a lot of people well dressed and very beautiful in this film. The staging is fair and the scenario is a little better than the material deserved. Nevertheless, this film fails to maintain the interest of all the most seasoned b-film fans. The best thing about it ... It ends up, but not soon enough.
