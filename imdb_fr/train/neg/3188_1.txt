The first sentence of Joe Don says a lot about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker stalking an Italian gangster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this film is to shoot people and get arrested several times. Everyone in the movie hates him, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked Greydon's previous picture, Angel's Revenge, because it was a tent for three-year-old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
