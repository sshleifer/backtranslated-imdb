First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) must know: the "style" does not sell. I guess Tashan, once translated, will mean style. Secondly, if you are resolutely turned towards style, this does not spoil you a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that would have been enough with a better director. But it's not slippery. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different times in history. But this configuration is not used correctly. There could have been a better mix of their stories. The sequences of actions date from the 70s. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the film is awful. I think Vaibhavi Merchant has just slept through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar got a good score, but he does not belong to this film. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is not the cool song Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) on Anil Kapoor when he's crazy in English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotype. This movie will not bother you.
