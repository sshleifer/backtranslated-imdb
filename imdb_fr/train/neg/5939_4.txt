I thought the movie was OK but very disappointed not to have captured the true image of his life. I could not wait to see her mother being a Jamaican, that makes me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. This completely erased the interest a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I am very disappointed, it's like watching a biography on Mark Anthony and letting Arnold play the role. I do not know what the author thought was missing a valuable element of the film in which his mother would have played an important role in his life. I will say that the movie was OK except Major Fla !!!!!!
