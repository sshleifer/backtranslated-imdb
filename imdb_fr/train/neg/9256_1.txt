No need to talk about a group of half-naked men who slap and beat each other. That's all. We see this for about 5 minutes. It is shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men slapping each other to the sound of awful music. This sounds interesting, but there is no plot and really - the violence inherent in this has become disturbing. It also plays homo eroticism, but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. This would appeal to some people who like avant-garde material, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and disturbing (sometimes). Really - what is the purpose of all this? I saw it as part of a homosexual shorts festival and the audience was sitting in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.
