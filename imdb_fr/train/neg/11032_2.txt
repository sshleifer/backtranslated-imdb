"I Love New York" is another entry from VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing the fun side of dating an angry and obnoxious woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the craziest candidate, who speaks Ebonics, the craziest - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will say "it's a show". Admittedly, it's not as bad as its previous show, "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a skit from the 90's "In Living Color" show, where Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated boxer Mike Tyson on "The Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens "for a date. Mike talked about the agreed date, but how the unpleasant mother kept hitting. This show reminds me. <br /> <br /> The men are chosen and have names to degrade and the woman with whom they go out more - (I would think that a smart man looking to go out with a smart woman would not allow him - nor to his mother - to give you a name if ghetto, you will embarrass yourself every time you watch on TV.) actors of professional reality, so why bother. <br /> <br /> It escapes me to discover what is so much fun about all this. The fact that it is as false as its newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make money.) Maybe the wonder is: who would want to be with this woman after an hour? Or ask yourself if her mother's next show and she will be on the WWF! No matter how you cut it, you end up with a train wreck that you have seen countless times before, the shock value is now zero. <br /> <br /> No twist will make this wreck more interesting than the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and to those who call an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail to justify their immediate end.
