I can not believe that this movie has even been turned into video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on sale. I literary asked for a refund. Remove the fact that the film has no historical truth, it's still the worst film ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a movie rated B. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. Just the voice and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be removed from the union, leaving a black mark on the industry, but after watching most of this film, I really do not think anyone involved is a member of the union.
