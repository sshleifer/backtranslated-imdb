Fortunately, I saw this for free and I wish it were better than it was, but it's really the same old thing that movie studios seem to impose on us over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposed and yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this plot does not surprise you and not excite you, the film will not be. <Br /> <br /> Lots of visual gags and pet jokes. Halfway through the movie, I started to understand that Ben Stiller was not really funny, but he was trying VERY harshly. And Jennifer Anniston is not really pretty, but her hair is beautiful. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be part of this kind of medium film, I was expecting more from them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw this after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original movie - and that I compared both in my head, and that I thought I wanted film directors to be forced to sit back and forth with these two films - maybe that would make sense of it and <br /> <br /> they would start doing better movies with strangers rather than that type of formula that plays better in airplanes.
