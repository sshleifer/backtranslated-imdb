I'm sorry but it's just pathetic. The little girl was a kid, they were not pleasant characters and the plot was nil. Besides, it was not even an igniter as the movie would have us believe. If you consult a complete guide on reptiles, you will find that it is a crocodile and not a gator. Obviously, they have not hired a real animal expert, otherwise they would know that the creature is a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
