What did the director think? Everyone who read Artemisia's biography is impressed by his courage to face a public rape trial in the Renaissance era and even to be tortured to show Tassi was guilty. This shows true independence and emancipation - at its most terrible time, she is his man. Why should Renaissance films have to be clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid of seeing the hard side of life, or has it won the good Hollywood mood? Although I always defend the director's freedom to create his own reality in a film, I can not understand how to overthrow the life of Artimisia. Very disappointing choice by the authors of this film.
