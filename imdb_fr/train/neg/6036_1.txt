Featuring an unknown cast that seems to stay like this, this "movie" is another cheap slasher film that surprises me as to the release of this one. I have no problem with horrors and slasher movies in particular, in fact these are my favorites. But when they finish THIS BAD, it really takes the monkey and it is no wonder that the genre is having such a difficult time. The story is as clich√© and unimaginative as possible with a group of people in a cabin in the woods that are cut and tinkered by this type zombie / ghost. This is not the story that fears the most, it is his atrocious and dialdog play, his quality of staging homemade and his soundtrack horrible. Not to mention laughable effects and incredibly lazy movie making - these morons are out on a clear day and yet we are supposed to believe it's nighttime ?? What did the director think of this movement? What, he had only one day to film all this? He was afraid of the dark? (It's hilarious to see a cop walk around in the middle of the day with a torch acting as if it's completely black) <br /> <br /> I guess the positive side for the actors is that they look like people who work in a local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed. I'm sure one of the "teenagers" plays bingo at the local pub - but she's between 40 and 45 years old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good to laugh, but it's still a loss of film and time.
