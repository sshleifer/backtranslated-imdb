1st good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they do not go for the gimmicks. The film is based on the true story of the culmination of human history and even presents one of the participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br />, for krissakes! Fly with big googy human eyes, certainly, but fly anyway. Remember when I compared the "Underworld" movies to cockroaches? It was not meant to be a eulogy, and I had never imagined someone would literally take it. This one has even less empathy. Little maggots? Ugh. In one of those strange confluences of the Hollywood group, this film was obviously on the drawing board at the same time as "Space Chimps", also about creatures in space. a film of 9 on the REAL space program (RIP).
