bad interpretation, bad accents of the South, incoherent cinematography, horrible scenario ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and I was so discouraged to have seen it . It contains names of talents cited / not mentioned, but they do not give the expected results. Of course, the basis of this is the unequal and uninteresting story that is told. <br /> <br /> do not worry
