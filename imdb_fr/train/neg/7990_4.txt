"Anita and Me" is a drama about growing up in a multi-ethnic Britain, much like "Bend it Like Beckham", or more accurately "East is East", with which it shares a 1970s backdrop. your tone is resolutely chirping (despite the dull accents of Black Country), but the film lacks' East is the vigor of East and the result seems rather thin and banal. In addition, the representation of the central relationship of the film, between an Asian and her white friend, is not deep enough to justify the structure of the film. I also got tired of movies where the hero has long been a writer, that's naturally often what real writers have experienced, but it's hardly a new item in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; "Anita and Me" seems obvious and dull in comparison.
