I am both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this film is so accurate about Vietnam and have never been there. This film is about as true of the entire Vietnam War as Rodney King's beat is true of ALL police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and have happened), but in general, the people who live there are like you and me. They have morals, they do not kill machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened much more rarely than the "hype" would suggest. Oliver Stone has the knack for making movies that show the Vietnam War as a brutal bloodbath, but are just as much based on reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe in Vietnam's stereotypes, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA did not do as well in South Vietnam as ALL soldiers in the US Armed Forces. Fact: WWII soldiers treated the enemy much worse than the Vietnamese soldiers and were well received on their return. The excellent Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect. Although the war was badly conducted from a political point of view, no one could have asked our soldiers any more, and it is very deplorable to say that this kind of fiction "essentially true" corresponds to reality.
