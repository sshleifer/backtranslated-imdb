This horrible film brings together all the Asian stereotypes that you can imagine in a hideous package. Sneaky Japanese businessmen are sending money to an endearing but adorable policeman, Pat Morita, looking for trade secrets in Detroit. Here, he finds himself facing Jay Leno, who quickly refers to a murder victim as Jap and calls Morita Tojo. Everything is downhill from there.
