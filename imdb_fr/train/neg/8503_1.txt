with all the European studios involved in this one, you could at least get pretty pictures; but the local color is reduced to a minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1: Mira Sorvino uses a Russian accent to play a Spanish cop - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There is a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is it lesbian or not? - no use. The movie cops are the stupidest to have been in a serial killer movie for a long time. There seems to be a message about the Spanish Civil War of the mid-30s, but as almost everyone involved in this war is dead, we do not see the point. of part of the story (which part? who can say it), we never even see a bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
