Remakes (and suites) have been an essential part of cinema since the beginning of the media. It is almost a coincidence or chance. If you take what is good from the original and rely on it and update key features to current standards, you will be successful. Note that films such as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have been successful. Others, like KING KONG (1976), fail miserably. <br /> <br /> BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the model of this film. It is as perfect as possible on such a subject and we note it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, love, innocently found by chance and tragically lost. Why, it just happened for the two (2) directors involved at the wrong time. These are convincingly and sensitively described by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are conventionally the material Star, but actors of character of quality. For details, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, what's wrong? A T.V. film, remade virtually scene by scene with renowned actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb ****** Six. Both actors, however, seem disinterested, showing just to hit their clocks and recover their checks. Neither are involved with their characters or with each other. You do not believe that they are in love or when they finally separate it is a great loss for one or the other. This should not be and that is why he fails in his intention. Sometimes it's better to leave things in peace.
