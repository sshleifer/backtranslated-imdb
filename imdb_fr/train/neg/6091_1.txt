I bought this film by exciting a glorious and free bloodbath. I do not have any. This film fails on virtually every level, not at all scary, nor funny, it's just terrible to make a movie, and never provides anything to see. The problem is that far from being as brutal, violent and brutal as she promised, there is very little violence. Virtually no blood shed, and no excitement whatsoever. To act, to direct and to dialogue is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really laughable. I could hardly sit down once in this garbage. I will certainly never want to look at it again. Do not waste your time with a celluloid waste like this; it's really maybe the worst film ever made. If I could give him fewer stars, I would do it.
