Even worse than David Lynch's worst "confusathon", "Brain Dead" makes no sense. The shamefully wasted talents (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bounce like in a cartoon of "Tom and Jerry" on Acid. The development of the character is negligible. He just begins to climb "the odd ladder" until he reaches total chaos. Do not get carried away because of the excellent actors above. They are not given any way to work and you will wonder what is going on throughout the unbearable 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless you want to disperse your brain in total nonsense. - MERK
