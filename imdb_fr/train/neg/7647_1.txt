Bridges of madison county is a more complete version of this story. I felt that the end of this film had not been treated sensitively, as in the original English movie. This film is very indianized, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a film when the hero dies in the end, you will love this film. On the other hand, if you are a fighter of life and think that crying not like the end. But overall, it is a very good subject that is well treated for Indian living conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. Everyone has done well.
