This must have been an embarrassment for all members of the all-African-American cast. Every pejorative and contemptuous stereotype of the American black community is highlighted. I will not reinforce the insults by listing them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons and dice. <br /> <br /> A good Ethel Waters song (and some bad ones), and the fantastic singing The 8-year-old singer talents of Sammy Davis bring the total to less than 1 on the IMDb scale.
