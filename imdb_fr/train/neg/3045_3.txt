Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought at Walgreens for a very good dollar. I'm still not sure whether it's a well-spent dollar or a stupidly wasted dollar. <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes quite surprising. Apparently, a lot of thought and effort were needed to achieve them. The sets are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them very much. And Santa is impressive. One of the most impressive fathers in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I guess the intent and purpose of this movie was to be comforting and cheerful for a children's audience. But, in a way, it seems quite disturbing. In fact, I am amazed at how disturbed he is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it so weird and weird. One of the reasons I prefer to watch movies in the original language and use English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unexpected strangeness. Children's voices have at least been dubbed with actual children's voices, as opposed to women claiming to be children, which tends to sound very, very bizarre. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You have not? Me neither, until I watch this movie. We learn something new every day. <br /> <br /> Does this film really deserve to be viewed? Now, it's a tossup. In all conscience, I can not recommend it to anyone because it is quite disturbing in its own way. Yet, his involuntary quirk is what makes him interesting to watch. You decide what you will do. I do not know ... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable to see demons constantly making cute ballet moves. Now, it's just wrong
