There is a British edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the American version. The person concerned will have a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and a bathroom and is extremely grateful for what she has got. The American version of this show is all that reality TV should not be. Instead of making some improvements to a home that the occupants could not afford or do themselves, the entire house will be rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what is the miserable social protection system in the United States or if you crave hard enough, you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement taking place, especially at Sears, is also unexpected. Rather than turning a family living in a disadvantaged area into a potential millionaire, it would be far better to help the community as a whole, instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a house, building something for the entire family. community ..... maybe a place where DIY and power tools can be borrowed and returned with building materials so that everyone can benefit if they wish. Giving everything to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same dilapidated houses.
