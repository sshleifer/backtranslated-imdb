This Worldwide was the cheap version of what the NWA led by Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions had achieved in the 1980s on "Big 3" stations located during Saturday morning / afternoon wrestling madness. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed version of the NWA, he made it a global fight and gave up all references to the NWA. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were renamed with the WCW logo and left the road for the Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. In the end they are nothing more than summary shows for WCW's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Around the world, Turner was officially the last WCW program to air on the weekend of Vince McMahon and WWF's WCW takeover. Today, all NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide videotape archives, as well as the entire NWA / WCW videotape library, are generally housed in the WWE headquarters in Stamford, Ontario. Connecticut.
