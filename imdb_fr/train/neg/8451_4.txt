I must admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A top Hollywood movie. But ... no one has said it so far (at least in the last 20 comments), with regard to the scenes in the courtroom and the character of Brat Pitt followed his plan to save both friends, who are rightly accused of murder. felt deceived. This film insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Attention spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept his false alibi, presided over by the priest? If these two guys had been with him, why should not they say that during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were judge or jury member, would you believe it? Is it wise to give the motive of the assassins? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and that makes me angry. This film had great potential. 4/10
