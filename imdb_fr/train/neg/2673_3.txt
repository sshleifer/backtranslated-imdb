Not long enough to have a feature film and not abrupt enough for a short film, this thing exists for a reason, having a lesbian to three. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that it could have made a decent feature film. Misty fits well in her outfit and is a very arrogant girl and when people are so fascinated by a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make naked calendars, you know that a soft-core movie explodes. Unfortunately, it's pretty pathetic. Especially the sex scene painfully false between Darian and Misty, where you can see his hand fingering. Look at this if you can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a beautiful blonde and who has always been akcent.
