For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film according to the confusion of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only rate the film with 4 of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I have not seen much chemistry between their two characters. The film is based on the opposite principle "Pretty Woman", in which Dermot plays the role of Nick, a very expensive male escort engaged by the character of Debra, Kat, to accompany him to England for the wedding of his sister. A romantic relationship probably develops between the client and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks in the relationship between Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> In a supportive role, Amy Adams was remarkable as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy appeared on the screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the energy of the film. Maybe if Amy Adams had played the role of Kat, the film would have had more dynamism. But finally, instead of looking for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine to at least pretend that this movie had an authentic feeling and a romance.
