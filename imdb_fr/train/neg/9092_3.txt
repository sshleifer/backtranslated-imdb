Friz Freleng's "Speedy Gonzalez" is the second cartoon to present the main character after Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for Two". In this caricature, Speedy was a nasty little creature with a big gold tooth, but in his second appearance, the famous motif had already been adopted. Although he looks much more beautiful, Speedy never developed to become a character. A big hat, incredible speed and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character and that's about all Speedy has ever had for him. Nevertheless, the arrogant little mouse proved to be extremely popular and continued to play in many short films, including some truly abominable films of the last days of the studio. Although these first Speedy shorts are better than subsequent atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) associated with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags generally based on a similar hunting formula. . In this eponymous episode, Speedy is recruited by other mice to steal cheese at the local plant guarded by cat Sylvester. Although it brings the extra weight of a star to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily be filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is undermined by the fact that he is forced to the unpredictable. undemanding role of the prosecutor. This has always been a problem in Tweety's cartoons too, but Speedy makes the opponent even duller thanks to his hateful audacity and the flagrant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would have to appear alongside Speedy for many years. Despite a fairly basic formula and small laughter, "Speedy Gonzalez" won an Oscar and a totally unworthy star was born.
