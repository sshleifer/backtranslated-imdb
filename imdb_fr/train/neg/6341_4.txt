East Palace, West Palace reminded me a bit of the detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of policeman and William Windom is the boy. I guess it's a progressive film for China, but it also perpetuates the myths about the femininity of homosexual men: there's a lot of talk about Chinese myths in which men play female roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He sails into the park without fear - he hopes to be taken to the station by the officer. And that happens in fact. Then, he tells his whole life to the policeman while being subjected to a light torture: obliged to remain crouching for a certain time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the homosexual man wants and, implicitly, the homosexual man challenges the policeman's self-image as a manly man. The story of the gay man's life (which includes flashbacks) is bearable, but when he begins to portray old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for Chinese homosexuals, who only want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not tell.
