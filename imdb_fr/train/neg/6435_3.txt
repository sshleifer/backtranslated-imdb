I can not believe anyone would put this film in the same context as the exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and frightening, Stigmata was brutal, clumsy and too formal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen from all time, but the imagery does not make for the downward spiral of patronizing exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was met when it was compared to The Exorcist and my visit to the official website increased that interest. The website contained many stories of "real" stigma throughout history. However, scene by scene, the film is so obsessed with its quest for "authenticity" that it first becomes comical, then difficult to watch towards the end. I began to be wary when the priest in charge of investigating potential miracles entered the beauty salon where our alleged heroine cuts her hair and, of course, flirts with the priests. <br /> <br /> The plot: a woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the stigmata) and is disconcerted and upset by the ordeal. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan or a vase for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle of this film is that it finally ends.
