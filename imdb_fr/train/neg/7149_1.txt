Whoever wrote "Redline" as a great film about the car must be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this heap of extremely unhealthy and inflamed amateur shit. Easily the worst car movie or any film ever made. This gives Showgirls the appearance of Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eliminate all the cheesy shots of an 80s action TV series, add really no special effects, lame characters without any relevance and you have living proof not write scenarios and produce films but should remain in the real estate sector. <br /> <br /> It's such a lame film with such a lame plot and the most artificial action sequences of all time. What shocks me is not that the filmmakers of this film are idiots, but that they consider the film released as public idiots to crack for this shit.
