Primal Species comes from Roger Corman, legend of movie B, and all who watch it must understand that this is a low-budget movie B and know it. <br /> <br /> A group of terrorists stands out by a truck and they kill an entire army, they believe it must contain uranium, but no ..... It contains two Dino with a Taste for Human Flesh ... Then a team of Crack, who could also be called Delta Force, is called. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not a Jurassic Park, and yes, the Dinos are never clearly visible, because it's obviously a man dressed in a suit that is not so different from Barney the dinosaur - slightly LESS creepy, On the guys, that accounted for about 1% of the Jurassic Park budget and, as such, does what he can. <br /> <br /> Does this deserve to be at the bottom of the 100 list? .... HELL NO !!! I think that almost half of the voters who give a 1 - are too hard like that, it's much closer to a 4 ... it's actually a lot better than many other films that are not part of it of the last 100, and which has a production value similar to a Sci-Fi Channel production. (again the films that have an excessively hard time on the part of critics on IMDb) <br /> <br /> The acting is as expected in a movie B although no actor takes it seriously, no more than the scenario <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice film B - Not for snobbish movies <br /> <br /> ** on *****
