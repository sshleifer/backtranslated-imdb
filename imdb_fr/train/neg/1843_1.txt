Sensational. Simply horrible. I was a fan of the original movie and reluctantly sat in Part 2, 3 was an improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy plays the role of presenter of this series of anthologies at Rod Serlingesq. <br /> <br /> I can accept the fact that Freddy became a hit after another, but at least in the movies, Freddy's lure wore the films, but of poor quality, they looked like productions high school of a series of horror. The poor actors, if you really want to call this after doing this show are obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure it was a stopping point for two types of actors. Beginners on the Hollywood charts, newcomers ready to take any role that would dissuade them from taking the porn work that was offered to them last week, or seasoned actors on their way to the Hollywood charts ready to take n any role that would put They did not have to take that porn job that was offered to them last week. <br /> <br /> I almost expected Dana Plato to become a guest star, but she was already dead by the time she was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's phrase in the original Elm Street, "Whatever you do not fall asleep watching this."
