My brother is a passionate DVD collector. He glanced at the blanket (two models on the toilet) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to watch what turned out to be probably the most deserving film (I use this term vaguely), I felt compelled to sit still. I did not dare to look my brother in the eye, convinced that he had to curse the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name of all the movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in a scene. The "filmmaker" decided to show each take (about four in total) throughout the film. In fact, the entire film follows this costume pretty much. The fact that the DVD contains deleted sequences was a shock. (I went to bed without looking at him, though). Not surprisingly, I found this record without its holster behind the TV about a week later.
