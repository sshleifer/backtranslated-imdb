This is the best example of a reduced budget, which makes it possible to win what would be a good story. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (after seeing her working on CO, I know she can do better), then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad, and most of the time poorly computer generated, that he almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And the change (alert!) From Samaire Armstrong to werewolf was achieved by first reducing it to a bad GCIF figure before it even began to change (the humans of Final Fantasy, as well as those of Pixar the have made ridiculous, consider this figure as a naked Barbie. <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​the lineage among werewolves is nothing new. As it has also weighed the evil, (perhaps) not so bad, and the possible end of the human race if the two lineages meet. The sub-plot of a "werewolf lineage book" that affected some of the other characters for some time was effective, but could have been more developed to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better storyline and direction, and I'll come back again.
