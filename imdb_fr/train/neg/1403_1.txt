A waste of film absolutely miserable! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, almost no train, no mystery, no interest. Constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. All the rest is pathetic. The premise is silly: a group of people stranded in the middle of a no-place because their train was held for less than 3 minutes. What? And does the railroad leave them no place to stay, in a big storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can walk 4 miles through the dead-black fields. well yes. Sure. They can also impose themselves on the hospitality of the railway and stay at the "haunted" station. A station that turned out to be a deadly nuisance, absolutely without ghosts, without interest or intrigue. <br /> <br /> So terribly dull that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the list of lost movies !! aargh !!
