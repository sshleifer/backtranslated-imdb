Holy Sh * t was terrible god. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I was going to lose my eyes in the Oedipus Rex mansion. dear God. this film does not deserve more credit than a movie lover does. please save your money, this movie can not offer you anything. unless you like shows and sleep in movie theaters. you know, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you'll be the only ones there anyway. F @ ck this slideshow. <br /> <br /> Be warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> hello. <br /> <br /> how are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this Daym movie. it's sad.
