It was a loss of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around a devilish lesbian who makes rich married men have sex with her and then makes them sing for money. One of the victims is a DA candidate, which causes problems in her relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the perverse lesbian also seduces this woman! Meanwhile, the girlfriend of the evil lesbian does not really like to sleep. It ends with a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women also undress a lot, especially in situations that go beyond reality. bad bad bad.
