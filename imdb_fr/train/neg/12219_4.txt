It was a strange film. It started rather well. A solid soundtrack behind flash images of gore and chaos as our psychopath did what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Then comes his "fall" Which allowed me to think that I was in the movie "B". Bad acting, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the scene of the death of our psychopath, we get the opening credits and the movie begins ... <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the big breasts act badly, a bucket of blood casual and poorly executed death scenes. <That said, I gave a film to four because despite its flaws, it kept a sort of goose bumps that I just could not forget. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. movie, but I must admit that I look worse.
