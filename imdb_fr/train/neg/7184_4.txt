It was not really a very good movie. There has been a lot of improbable and predictable things happening in the movie ... but I think most critics do not know why this movie should be appreciated by a large audience. THIS FILM HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not that enough to make us all watch this movie? A film produced by a former NBA star does not happen every day, you know. Amazingly stupid children in a big house being cut by an ax brandishing a psychopath. Each shot allowed us to moan. Teen sex And all this was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Drug use among adolescents! College hijinx! And all this was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
