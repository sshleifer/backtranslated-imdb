I'm happy to see that most people here do not think much about this film either. There are big names in distribution, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend, except to ogle some pretty women that can be done in thousands of movies. <br /> <br /> The story only features inimitable, selfish characters, smoking the chain, which national film critics all seem to like ... and the majority of the public can not stand up. <br /> <br /> The Oklahoma accents are so fake that they are derisory, the racist stereotypes of the South are quite likely from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
