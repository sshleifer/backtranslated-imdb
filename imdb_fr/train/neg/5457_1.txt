An actor asks, "What is my motivation?" To understand his character. After watching this "docudrama", this vague and random farce, a viewer wondered what was the motivation of anyone. <br /> <br /> This inept offspring of daytime television (the Oprah show) missed an exceptional opportunity to explore heavy issues. <br /> <br /> His characters were all superficial and superficial, his story much less socially redemption than an episode of "Simpsons". He described the police investigation as unprofessional and incompetent. He did not explain why the court could treat the main character, a pedophile, so differently that he would have a man. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman start "grooming" her sophomore, start an affair with him when he returned to his grade six class? Why did the boy's mother testify on his behalf? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generational rationalization and greed. The film gave no indication on this subject. <br /> <br /> Why was the viewer not informed that the victim's mother had sold the interview rights to the tabloids of the print and television media, scrolling through her teenage son in "The Today Show"? That Mary Kay's lawyer cashed her case, she herself appealed the law on the "Son of Sam" in order to profit from his crime by selling his story to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican Congressman, the 1972 US Independent Presidential Election Candidate, the President of the John Birch Society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career was interrupted when he discovered that his own community college student had children who were only exposed when this mistress sexually mutilated their young son? Yet Letourneau's father had withdrawn his many children from Catholic schools "too liberal", fighting to prevent all schoolchildren to receive sex education? <br /> <br /> One month after she was released on parole, she is 14 years pregnant again Mary Kay, her second daughter, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for many probation offenses. A prophetic editorial concerning the sad case then appeared in the Seattle Times: "After two miserable hours, LeTourneau was taken to prison, and that salacious mix of sensations made for television was over, until the beginning of the casting. " Indeed, 18 months later, the filming of this tragedy was underway.
