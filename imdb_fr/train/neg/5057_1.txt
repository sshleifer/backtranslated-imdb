Film very outdated with a sullen and awful dialogue, with clichés and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk act constantly. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take long to discover how disastrous this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total boredom, filled with histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is horrible. Camera movements are unimaginative, as is character building. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting clichés. The actors are constantly smoking and we are seeing advertisements for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed. (an exception: Ned Beattie "is a simple and enjoyable way to play the hit man).
