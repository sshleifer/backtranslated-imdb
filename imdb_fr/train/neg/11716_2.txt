After looking at that, I thought there were too few good writers and directors, or a lot of producers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that is not fun, but rather grinding and quivering. Make you shout "it's wrong" to the movie. Immersion is zero. Now, most of you are probably used to the terrible mistakes / quirks in movies that contain hackers, etc. This film is like that in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily, brilliantly performed by Eliza Bennett. I hope it will become big, and that it deserves at least something. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not look at that. There is not even proper action in it. Total loss of time.
