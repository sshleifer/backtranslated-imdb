Janeane Garofalo expressed dissatisfaction with this film, calling it an anti-feminist. She also said on her radio show that she hated doing "romantic comedies" because she did not believe it. I totally agree with Janeane here. This film is at best a trifle. She is doing her best but, overall, it was another boring and incredible "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While some will say "suspend your disbelief", we're tired of having to suspend it almost every time you receive a romantic Hollywood movie. Janeane's character, for whatever reason, is usually filmed in the shadows and dark, which makes her unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in light tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she hates this movie). It really hurts the film if we have to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the most beautiful of the two. As many have said here and in other reviews, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, she is very beautiful. I did not read a review where someone said that Uma was more beautiful. That said, I think that Ben Chaplin's character would remain more than likely with Uma, not with Janeane. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men), and unfortunately, Ben would probably have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. In any case, its natural beauty is visible. <br /> <br /> I think that Janeane's many male fans, obsessed with her, love this film because they like to think about themselves in the character of Ben Chaplin and score with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower, gentlemen. This is the role for which Janeane is the best known, and it's a shame, because it's not really a good movie.
