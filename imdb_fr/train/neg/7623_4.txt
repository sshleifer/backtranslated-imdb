This little show is obviously a kind of stupid little prequel / idiot from the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the live action series, this show is a shit. The live show featured smart jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically a bitter sweet-bitter version that younger viewers can digest, I think kids may hate that crap. <br /> <br /> The storyline of each episode is basically fair, Sabrina has a stupid and useless dillemma. use magic to fix it. It's basically the idea for every episode. The strangest episode was when Sabrina used magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes the courage to become his slave. This then leads to a weird and yet interesting scene where Gem says "come adore me for the moment" and where harvey kneels down and begins to kiss her feet as if she were a god. (Which is quite right since he is his slave to mental control) But this stupid fallout is not worth the time or the effort.
