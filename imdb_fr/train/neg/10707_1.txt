Where to start? It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The editing is the worst of all time, the sound effects were awful and the sound resounding. Most of the movie contains only crappy kick effects, with confusing threads in the background. I had to turn my volume fully, just for her, what was going on ... and what exactly did I hear? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can not believe that people have put green in this film. It makes me think that I could take a shit in a box, send it to the producers, and then have them finance a film for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph was a habit, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The bad guys were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a whore. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, making or editing a movie, look at this!
