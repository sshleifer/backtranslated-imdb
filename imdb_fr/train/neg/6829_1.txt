I wrote at least half a dozen scathing critics about this awful movie and none are published. So I have to say that someone on imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a group of oil tankers can resuscitate a military tank installed in the desert for over ten years and make it a fighting machine is ridiculous. It's the same for the actor and the management. Pass on it.
