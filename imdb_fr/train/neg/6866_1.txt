This film has so little class compared to Strangers on a Train or even Accidental Meeting besides, that in spite of the similarities of conspiracy, I would not feel entitled to compare that with one or the other . Yancy Butler's character felt like I'm too embarrassed for the author and director to keep watching. <br /> <br /> I do not like many movies in my life, but I feel obliged to watch from time to time. in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often moaned silently, but this film made me protest aloud, get up, leave the room and walk around the house muttering, before returning to my favorite chair to subject me to more torture. <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
