I will be honest. The only reason I watched this one on TV is that it's at the bottom of the IMDb 100. And now I'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life was really worth another check on this same list. <Br/> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in a huge fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer fired a "HAL" to defend himself. And yes, after all the mandatory explosions, shootings and prosecutions, he is the latest to date. Combined with a dreadful acting game and a somewhat boring editing, he guarantees that his place in the infamous list is right. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see this complete list. 2/10.
