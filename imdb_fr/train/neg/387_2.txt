One must wonder if at some point in the production of this film, there was a script that made sense. Was the raw cut 3 hours long <br /> <br /> and was it cut in the incoherent mess that was left? <br /> <br /> Why would someone finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a handsome young man and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with the dialogue and dramatic situations (?) That are given to him. But <br /> <br /> the characters come and go for no apparent reason, the continuity is <br /> <br /> non-existent and the acting, the cinematography and the staging are <br /> <br to put it politely) amateurish. Not a sleep is an unfortunate choice <br /> <br /> because it will probably prove wrong if someone <br /> <br /> really tries to watch this movie.
