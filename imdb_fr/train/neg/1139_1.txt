Please note that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not wear it. However, I really want to say something about it. In fact, I am doing research for the university on the main character Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to point out that the person on whom they founded the main character was actually completely different !!! With Hollywood's ideas about the people and artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke totally approved of hysterectomy to cure the madness of women and would never have practiced such a liberal activity as shown in the film. I think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers and say that this film has a historical basis! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please, do not waste your time on a movie with such contempt for the horror experienced by real women at the hands of this doctor who has been glorified by the film industry.
