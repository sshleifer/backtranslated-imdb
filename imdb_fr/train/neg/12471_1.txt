Living in the Middle East (Israel), I was excited about buying my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer and being an amateur-thriller, I was expecting first of all to see a breathtaking, fast-paced film that wisely plunges into global decision-making and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, from a new angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The rhythm was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, interlaced montages made the understanding of logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end, we do not care. Save your money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
