Looking through the other reviews, I am surprised that there is no warning to potential viewers what to expect when renting this trash. First, I praised this thing with the understanding that it was an expert Indiana Jones knock-off. What I got was one of the most shocking films I can remember trying to sit on, made even more shocking by the film's relatively high production values. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a spoiler, but If so, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your entertainment idea is to watch Bimbo get done rape from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief, as she stares into the dead eyes of the severed head of her significant, by all means, rent this movie. Otherwise, I would advise you to look elsewhere to keep you entertained. <br /> <br /> When you think about it, this scene sums up the film so succinctly that I have nothing else to say about it.
