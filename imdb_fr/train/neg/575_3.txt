This film is not very good. It's boring, and not a lot of blood for a horror movie. The plot just works with not much happening. And I think the vampire woman was so stupid. She had plenty of opportunities to kill vampire hunters, because it shows her having bright reflexes. But every time she has a pin, she just takes her time and there's always something going on that she does not bite. No wonder this is happening directly to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Not as good as the first Vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste your time on it.
