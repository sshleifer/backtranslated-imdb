I have rarely witnessed a waste of talent as free. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this marsh without a movie film. The few interesting strands that the film seems to promise in the beginning are little more than red herrings. Major actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles that go nowhere. an occasional genius producer produces a film that seems to be shot through a camera lens stained with coffee; A writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of ill-motivated incoherence. The film has an impression of cheap, lustful, but barely at the level of the comment, it is really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come to IMDb to write balanced comments, generally appreciable. This blatant disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless and bilious speech. I will not do it, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "spirit" of this trash.
