So they made fun of the violence and it was called sick. Well, I'm afraid that violence is the best part, but unfortunately, the characters are not sufficiently developed to allow us to understand why they are embarking on an unleashing (totally predictable). This film has a really terrible scenario. We never have the chance to know Robert and his actions in the end are simply pathetic. The role of actor is not much better either, the worst of them being the head of television and the teacher. The direction is clumsy, the rhythm is enough to make you sleep. And what is the film project of the school? A comment on the film itself perhaps? The use of topical movies in decisive murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals but are desperately out of their depths. How on earth did they manage to convince the great Yorgos Arvanitis that I'll never know. And how they had the money to do it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely horrible beyond comprehension.
