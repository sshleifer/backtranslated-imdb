If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I read the book. Who already wrote on screen ruined the screenplay. There are so many changes, that it was not really worthy of the title. Character changes, plot changes, schedule changes ... <br /> <br /> First, who was Henry and the investigator? They were not in the story. Henry had a bit of Mitch's personality, but Mitch was not a cop. No, you did it that way, Roz helped to "sink" his body and used it as blackmail for Zenia against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was that Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to move away from him. His son was also blackmailed because he was hiding from being gay to his mother. His son was not even really mentioned in the story. I do not think it was his lover, Roz's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. He was with Zenia for the first time in college. The apartment painted in black was their idea, Tony just went to visit him. This is where Zenia and Tony meet and quickly become friends. Tony hides his love for West. Then Zenia went west with Tony's money, and then West and Tony found each other. Subsequently, West leaves Tony for Zenia for a short time. Only to have the heart broken again. Then come back to Tony. Tony's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. As a college teacher, she did not want to let him out. I would say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Charis's character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia did not trick her into having cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father, he was a tracker in the Vietnam War. Finally, after Charis took care of Zenia for months for what was actually a medical withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an adventure under Charis's nose while taking care of them. Then Zenia goes to the government with Billy and leaves with him on the ferry. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her. Charis also had a double personality. Karen was his real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia did not die after being cut in pieces .... she fell or was probably pushed (never seen) from the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had heroin of almost pure quality in her blood, and it was likely that she would take it unconscious and fall as she did. She was also really dying of cancer this time around. <br /> <br /> This did not show any childhood memories or anything that attached the characters to the reader. The book has been scratched to bare bones. Then re done in someone else's vision. Why could not you write your own story in the manner of what you did the movie? It was quite different, and I'm sure we could have done more.
