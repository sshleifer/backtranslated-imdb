I love John Saxon in whatever he is in. The only time he supports the camera, he makes a film that should have been more aptly titled "Please, do not watch this movie called: House of Death Zombie". The $ 1,000 Shock Insurance Certificate is the tricky way for Fred Olen Ray to spend $ 14 on a landfill filmed by a great 1970s cheese legend. Ray is the leader in RetroMedia. By the way, Ray makes Charles Band look hotter than the stucco ceilings of a Ford Falcon. It's just bad now, both - and boring, by the way. It's great that Ray digs up these old stuff and in some cases it's in the public domain, as in the case of other crazy video, but in the case of Zombie Death House - (the word "Zombie" is superimposed on negligible way to add ownership and interest on the part of DE FOR) THE ONLY WAY TO FACE THIS TEST IS TO PUBLISH IT IN THE DOLLAR MARKET OF CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND SAXON FANS !!! If you want to see some real Saxon, get Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
