When you want the dragon to eat all the members of the cast, you know you're trapped. <br /> <br /> I came in with very low expectations, after reading some of the other reviews, and was not let down. However, unlike other cheap and failed movies, this one does not really stay funny (and unintentionally) funny all the way through. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very inconsistent. Looking beyond "small" errors, such as the dragon growing in 3 hours, the idea on which it is based is messed up. You see, the movie wants us to believe that the dragons came from space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show a peasant who goes after his fork and the dragon comes out. Later, the obligatory type of "mad scientist" explains how the dragons survived the dinosaurs. So, apparently, humans were present when the dinosaurs were present, or we just have a little hole in the plot here. The other important thing is that the laboratory is dynamited with a force "half as powerful" as that used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later come in to check everything, and it's almost unhurt! There is even another dragon, who is born of who knows what. Overall, it's very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned the cloning, I guessed they would clone a dragon. This means that our security officer, Mr. Smarty-pants, is not as intuitive and intelligent as the film would have you believe, if you do not know I knew it would be about, you know, dragons . <br /> <br /> Putting this aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects". Others mentioned the early fallen rocks, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a stain, but it ruined everything that happened when he dragged down the hall in the same way, many times. To their credit, the flying dragons at first seemed to go well (although the cave is probably the worst of the entire movie.) These things are fun to watch. The scenes where are represented a million different shots of the same person facing in different ways are not. Neither "introductory" screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Regarding the actors, they were not the best, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than most of the players participating in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for that. One thing I noticed, however, is that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered with a makeup of many shades lighter than the rest of her skin. It looked like she had a bad fight with a white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and nerdy. You do not really notice the music, but in reality it's not so bad for most. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not look at it unless you want to see it because you hear it badly. I did it), although the only fun things are the bad effects of CG. Other than that, do not waste your time and money.
