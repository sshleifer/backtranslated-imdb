I have nothing against a fast-paced horror movie, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too freshly cleaned, too bright and modern. The intrigue, which speaks of a new teenager in a small town who is a "sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and who feeds on the blood of virgins, demands a more mysterious treatment and ambiguous. This thriller has an inappropriate color look, with virtually no atmosphere. As might be expected, the kids are pretty and energetic, but the biggest benefit is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, of "Ghost Story", never left the female mold, and it's a huge loss that she was no longer used. His performance is scary and intense, and suggests that "Sleepwalkers" could have been a much better movie with a different purpose and a tighter direction. It's too exaggerated and trade-oriented, with an irregular tone that goes a lot from a thriller to a comedy to drama. Stephen King makes his appearance, as do real directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
