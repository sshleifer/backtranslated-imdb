Thriller incredibly confused, confusing and ultimately ridiculous ("horses, oh my God, horses!"). It's sometimes scary, but it's one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. Watch how, in the last 10 minutes, everyone "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for "resolution" to happen. Bland's performances by the leaders, typical of Richard Lynch, are eccentric. Video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even harder to understand. 0 stars out of 4
