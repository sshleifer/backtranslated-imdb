The worst movie I've seen in a long time. Interesting first half with a captivating and engaging dialogue between dubious characters in a late-night bar. The film then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aimed at a visual shock (read the disgust) without observations or redemptive lessons on humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present at this demonstration and my politeness preventing me from disrespecting him. Yet, time is precious (as the director himself observed in his intro) and I really regret the time I lost in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> The three main characters of the first half were the saving grace of the film, especially the female lead role.
