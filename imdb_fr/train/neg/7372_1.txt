I am so confused. I have been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I saw all his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "weird". Steven Seagal shares the script and the production of the credits of this film, but I have a hard time believing that he would choose to double his own voice for many of his lines, with a lean and impulsive voice. What I do not understand is that if they had to copy some of their lines, why does their own voice appear on others? I think Seagal will age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this film barely releases a fraction of the same bragging air, self-confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal that he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous films. What I missed most was her arrogant and confident attitude and her cruel sneer that turns so easily into that adorable smile. Where is this attitude in your face and what charm have made it such a big star ??? I hope this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left us to offer - if so, its longtime fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all know and love is gone.
