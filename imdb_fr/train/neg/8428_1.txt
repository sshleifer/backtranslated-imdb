Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and the high rating, it's a horrible movie. Horrible enough, I feel obliged to tell you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the last period of the Raj, at the time of the fight for the independence of India. What follows in the ridiculous plot fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist at this time. <br /> <br /> For example, would the young Hindu married woman from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman, knowing that the discovery of this case would probably mean total social ostracization and shame if not deadly punishment? Not likely, but maybe still. However, would the same young Hindu maid, in the conservative society of India at that time, continue as a half-naked Britney Spears in heat, to participate in hot outdoor sex during the day, in unobstructed view where they could be discovered at any time? It's not only bloody, it's a delayed plot. <br /> <br /> Such idiocies combined with mediocre play pushed me to leave the cinema an hour after the beginning of the film, so I did not watch the second half of the film. We can only hope that the end is smarter than what I saw in the first half.
