Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a terrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies have generally been pretty clean. I lost a lot of respect for you in a movie as awful as this one. Very, very bad taste! I am embarrassed to have even rented this movie. Steven, if you keep playing in movies like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching a lot of your movies because you can still "catch the bad guy" with a few hand motions and make it clean ... something else. I'll think twice about renting another movie.
