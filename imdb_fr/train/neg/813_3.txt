The biggest thing that bothers me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH orders. But she speaks to him in German. The two languis are completely different, it's like saying "hey, he takes orders in French" and starts to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives more the impression of being a comedy actor and not a detective. The role just does not suit him, even if it's a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many things stereotyped / predictable. Typical comment or returns. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, I think it would be a nice movie to watch if it's ever on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
