Kalifornia is disturbing. I think there is no reason for this story to be told. It is neither entertaining nor social value. Technically, the film is very well done, the performances are top and first class. The story develops in an intriguing and interesting way. But in the end, this movie is disgusting and disgusting to decency. I recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
