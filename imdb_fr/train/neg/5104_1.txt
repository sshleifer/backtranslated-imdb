Now, what's the problem with the actors who took part in this shit? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? I loved him there ... Well, whatever, what can you expect from a movie with one of Baywatch's supervised lifeguards? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters are even friendly, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what is happening. I had the feeling that the filmmakers were trying some sort of "Attack of the killer tomatoes". Especially in the scene where all the important people have discussed national security in a sort of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, change channels - your TV will always be grateful.
