This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt sick watching it. Until then, the other tranches had at least one advantage. The first part was suspenseful and bloody. The second part was offbeat and fun. The third part was interesting and great. The fourth part featured good music, good special effects and a new entertaining film, Freddy Krueger. The fifth part is more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a much prettier blonde, part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. At times, this alleged payment of Elm Street is transformed into daytime soap. The new characters seem hard, and even this sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this one. He looks tired and does not seem to be so macabre. His one-liners seem out of place and different, where as in Part 4, they could be quite fun. The story of Leslie Bohem never starts and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The plot of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
