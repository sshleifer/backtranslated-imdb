We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The movie was pretty and the scenes reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the villain kill the owner of the mine? Not really related to the film except to establish its state and hiding. <br /> <br /> The bank employee did the wrong thing, but his behavior is too poor to make a convincing decision to hire killers against his employers. At least, continue to let us guess. No character developed at all for the owners of the bank or the employee of the bank. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in most events. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in-laws. Even more absurd than he confesses that to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff. Even more ridiculous that Martin hanged and his rope was broken, the sheriff took him under the threat of a revolver to finally return to his city and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Would not he just come back after the tape was sent quickly to save his wife and stop a bad kind of bank? Just send the judge a note that the gang confessed before being killed on the spot ???? Overall, it's very sad and it's useless.
