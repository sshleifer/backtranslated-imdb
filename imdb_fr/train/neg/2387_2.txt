I could not believe how bad and useless it was. Basically, there is nothing to laugh about in the film, there is almost no scene that can interest you in the rest of the film. This film attracted big stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves had to take acting lessons a few years after that film before moving on to Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and humble. Fortunately, I had this film for a very low price because it is certainly not a film to remember for good reasons. I will not write about the film's story, but know she's supposed to be America's most famous hitchhiker because of her huge thumb. I would give 2/10 to this movie. Before watching this movie, I wondered why this movie only got a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing film. Do not buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
