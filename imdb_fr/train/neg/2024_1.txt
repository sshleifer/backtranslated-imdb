Try to take advantage of the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100, here is a lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy "dancers" disguise themselves in red and shiny hooker outfit. A competitor is given the beginning of a phrase such as "Which team lost ..." with three choices, A, B or C, each completing the sentence. The competitor has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, to his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the candidate if he wants to "lock himself in the answer" and when the candidate says yes, he chooses a "dancer" to whom he shouts "Show me the money!" She opens a parchment that has an amount, and if her answer is correct, it adds that amount to her earnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So ​​theoretically, it is possible that a competitor on this monstrous debacle ends up owing money to Shatner.) There is also a "killer card" and if the candidate chooses the girl who has this ugly roll, but he has answered correctly, nothing happens. If the answer is wrong, the game enters Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he is wrong, he leaves with nothing. <br /> <br /> Before going on publicity, Shatner shouts: "Dance" and Shatner, the competitor and the 12 dancers shake the loot. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies "one last dance" and they shake him a little. <br /> <br /> I give this show a maximum of 6 episodes, when, hopefully, this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could have been worse: they could have bribed Cuba Gooding Jr as a host, though I bet he's a better dancer than "Shat", as they call him now.) <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It only lasted 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
