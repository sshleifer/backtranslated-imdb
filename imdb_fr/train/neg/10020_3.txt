"Tashan" by Vijay Krishna Acharya is an oversized and stylized product. It's certainly one of the most elegant films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will refuse it. Why? The film's script is as amateurish as a 2-year-old baby. The scenario is king, without a good script, even the greatest director of all time can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most famous production banner, "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is bland. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he accept a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor. In fact, he is the only savior. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks gorgeous and leaves you, all standing up. Saif Ali Khan does not receive his due here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are lost. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" is a boring film. Movies fail at the box office, if you stay away.
