I already know that critics and some audiences say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, names refer to other names, and so on. I can not do such things (I do not want to do it anyway) because it does not interest me, I'm interested in "cinema". As for the film itself, we say once again that the film is intelligent and extremely powerful. I could not see anything that we do not see in monster movies, except for the scene that's taking place in an office in the second half of the year. Yes, this scene speaks volumes about humanity, but it does not make the film brilliant. The film is entertaining (slightly) and exciting at times or in certain scenes, but not more than that. As for the biggest defect of the film, it is the visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a moment, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because it's not an old Gojira movie, it was made in 2006, but it's not was not. It's as if you do not believe there is a monster, you can not worry about it. If you agree with me about it, I highly recommend Cloverfield, which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's more of a drama than a thriller or an action, but that should not mean it's dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I'm trying to say that The Host does not do anything that other monster movies do not do. By the way, some people may call the film's masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's the fact.
