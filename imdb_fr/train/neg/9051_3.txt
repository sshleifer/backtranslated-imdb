I was so excited when I discovered it was available! I could not wait to see him. What a waste of energy! It's a bit like this rarity CD of your favorite band that you found at the back of the rack in your local music store. As an unconditional fan, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it, it became obvious why these dogs never became a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "finalists" who must have everything Lynch has done. "Six Men Getting Sick" is visually interesting but short and repetitive. Lynch's latest work "The Grandmother" is simply immature work. It's tedious and looks like a student movie. But it was the 70's ... It's only interesting if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see briefly the germs of some of his images and sounds. "The alphabet" is forgotten (no, really, I do not remember this at all!) "The amputee" is useless. "Cowboy and French" is just stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one that is worth it. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a troubling story comparable to her best work. I had to look at this one a few times. But it lasts less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
