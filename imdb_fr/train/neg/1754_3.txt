Why should the stories of Mary and Rhoda be so painful? Divorced women with indifferent girls. And why very little reference to the show and the original characters? The girl's characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why are there no girls who love the mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary leave Minneapolis and that Rhoda returns to New York, but why Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens could not be invited? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was nice to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was a meeting of the Mary Tyler Moore Show, a meeting of the Dick Van Dyke Show, hope Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards plot again.
