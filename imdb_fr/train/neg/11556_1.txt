Oh, those Italians! Assuming that movies about aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles drowned in a gothic atmosphere, and stabbed parents who are trying to get their hands on a legacy all fundamentally interest! If you've ever seen a movie like this, you've seen them all (MST3K's favorite song, "Screaming Skull", also fits) ... and "The night, Evelyn is out of the grave" is formulaic, by -the-numbers, and dull as hell. Even the succulent white Erika is wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
