The Good: I liked this movie because it's the first horror movie I've seen in a long time and that really scared me. The acting was not too bad and the murderer of "Cupid" was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The storyline and plot of this movie are incredibly weak. There was not much. The way the killer killed his victims was very horrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who does not know how to handle gore. <br /> <br /> Overall: a good scare, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** on *****
