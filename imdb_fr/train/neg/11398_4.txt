I saw this film primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I had met briefly in Los Angeles at a model show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought she was playing her part very well. As she is a model and a TV model as beautiful and posed, it was not surprising. I wondered why she had been killed and what had happened. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not really sure of the genre of this film, and although I liked the actors, I felt it was for a university audience. I tried to keep an open mind because horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt like I was out of bounds. It seemed to drag out in some places, you could guess where the power of the evil teacher was, and, like many other films, had an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> After writing a few scripts I know that a lot of things are difficult and can result from personal opinions, the number of films you have seen and studied and those with whom you tell at some point . <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) had finally come back through the portal and fucked everyone up, it would be a satisfying end and earn a higher score.
