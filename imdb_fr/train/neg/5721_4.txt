I was not at all a fan of the hit "Hostel" of 2005, and most of these lame imitations are just as bad or worse. Still, "Live Feed" managed to entertain me a little during the first 30 days. minutes. I started with a lot of sex scenes and sordid scenes, followed by good scenes of death featuring the Chinese organized crime brigade and a leather-clad 7-foot butcher ... which put me out of film was the hard "hero" with Firearms and a grudge that save the day ... I would call this film mediocre, at best, because a place involving mainly hateful youths massacred in a seedy pornographic theater, also serving as a hiding place for the mafia seduces me. If only the torture had been prolonged enough to be really effective, my note would have been very different. Unfortunately, most of the macabre is reunited in one scene, leaving the rest of the film as a revenge-like scenario. So, basically, it's a real "hostel" budget, with the redemptive use of free sex, almost constant during the first half of the film ... Overall, I would say that you do not mind .
