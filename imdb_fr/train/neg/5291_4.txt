STAR: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal background, had problems with is taking a drug that makes him paranoid and subject to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together but ends up falling like a doormat. Meanwhile, his mother, Janet (Laila Morse), knows Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and his drug habit that is growing and derailing. The film follows these desperate characters over their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable and that it would include watching movies that entertain them that way. Films like Nil by Mouth bear witness to this. It's the story of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, the kind that Jeremy Kyle would drop like a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of self-destructive men, separated from three generations and copying each other, tearing apart a family and women trying to maintain it, even if they are not strong enough. If you describe what it's all about from the start, you'll find that it does not promise to be nice to watch from the start, and it certainly will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> That's all. It's true what everyone has said about the performances, and the main stars, Winstone and Burke, offer excellent acting. We see Winstone lose him with his wife, striking her senseless after a new paranoia caused by coke, collapsing during a phone conversation with her and releasing a typical arsenal of words f and c when she refuses to let him see his child. Similarly, in a private moment, we see Burke deftly lose his calm on a staircase, the total impact of the night that preceded the start of the fight. as such, just a real life sensation of these hopeless lives continuing overnight. Many were acclaimed (including the Baftas!), But it was really too dark and dark for me. I do not have the right to criticize him, knowing what I knew from the offset, but unfortunately, that's how I found it. **
