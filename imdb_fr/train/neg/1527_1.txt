If you really want to really lose two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Browse TV programs. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When "Men in White" lights up, sit down and look. <br /> <br /> And there you are. After spending two hours of mediocre word games, dreadful (and not so funny) film references, and having experienced something with the lowest production values ​​ever recorded in recent history, you you will have lost two hours of your life and ask why. <Why did I do that? I was stupid enough to think that this movie could actually be a good thing. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you may notice some familiar faces during the movie. Probably to save on production costs, Saban (who also manufactures Power Rangers) decided to generously sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone's favorite toy franchise throughout the movie. I've spotted a lot of old episode monsters I've seen since my childhood, so I guess we could at least say it has some nostalgic value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the real power Rangers monsters, go see Power Rangers himself. It's much better than this trash. (And it says something!)
