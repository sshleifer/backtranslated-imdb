Woody Allen did "September", proving that even a genius could ruin everything. This is the "September" of Mel Brook. Monumental stupid, boring and not funny, I must admit that I have not watched until the end. The film ranks among the few disgraced (eg, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that fall asleep or force me to press the "fast return" button. And I say that sadly, as a devoted fan of Mel Brooks. He should stick to pure and simple comedy and leave the social commentary. How did the same guy who created "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" create a dog like this, it's beyond me. To avoid at all costs.
