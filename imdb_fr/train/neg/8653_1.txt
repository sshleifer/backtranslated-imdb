I went there in the hope that it would be the little gem "provoking thought" that people have reviewed this aspect. I love indy movies and hope to dig that too. knowing how important this topic is, I'm supposed to be really entertained, maybe even see an outside point of view. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow ... you will love that. Personally, I do not like the idea of ​​peeing or cutting myself, so I thought it was a garbage can. bad scenario, bad acting, bad story, bad staging, bad editing ... I could go on. I do not know why a critic claimed that he or she was arguing a political argument by giving this movie a 10, it's misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb does not set a precedent! it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is acceptable to watch as long as it is controversial (this movie is not, it tries VERY HARD to be but fails). <br /> <br /> you know that the movie is bad when you prayed 15 minutes for all the main characters to die horribly. unfortunately, they die, but not in the painful way that would have given the viewer justice or justification for having watched the two hours of shit they had just suffered. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor, do not even worry. I had this movie in a bargain basket in my local video store for .50 and I felt ripped off!
