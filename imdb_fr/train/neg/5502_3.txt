Silly overflow, often ridiculous involving the landing of a spaceship and the resulting havoc for Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the inhabitants of his orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in the 1983 "Terms of Love" as Shirley MacLaine's accomplice son-in-law. Over the years, Daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good fleshy role. Instead, he is in meaningless comedies such as "Dumb and Dumber". <br /> <br /> Regarding this photo, it fails because of the subject treated. At least, the television show has caused various situations. In the movie, the slapstick and people turn into monsters while the government is prevented from capturing the Martin-Martian. <br /> <br /> The role of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the film's non-success. On television, Pamela Britton has portrayed a skeptical person caught in situations where the Martian puzzled her. In the movie version, a blonde bombshell like Brown is an attempt at romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent, or is it really that? <br /> <br /> A very big disappointment for those who liked the TV show so much.
