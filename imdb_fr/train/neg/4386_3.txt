with a title like this, you know you should not expect a big horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! the actors are not so bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and downright stupid. No suspense, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically. It got so boring towards the end that I stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I do not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was excellent in Pulp Fiction, but ... she was 13 years ago, and she did not do anything decent after that. So, no wonder she must have fallen as low as this shit. Avoid or be warned ..
