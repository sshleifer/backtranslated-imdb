I saw this film about 5 years ago and the memory of this movie still haunts me today. I was fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, so I can only blame myself. But like most people, I did not believe in negativity. As a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable that one of his films could really be so bad. I thought it was just Sandler's enemies. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> We have here a comedy that does not even contain a second of anything amusing. It's actually quite an accomplishment. One would think that in a 90-minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even distractedly amusing. But no, it's just horrible. It's not "so bad it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at the gravity of the situation, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will make you laugh at least, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this film were recorded on a videotape, people would die instantly, with their own hands, and they would smile when they realize that their agony is over. That would be the first smile since they pressed the play button. <Br /> <br /> You might be inclined to look at him to see how bad he is, unable to curb your curiosity. Do not please do not. Believe me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie of all time and those who have not seen it yet.
