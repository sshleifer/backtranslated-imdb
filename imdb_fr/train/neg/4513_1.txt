Although the book does not exactly correspond to the real situation, he still spoke about Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone who participated in the making of this film has ever been to Japan because he did not feel Japanese at all. Almost everything was terrible. I will admit that the actors were generally good enough but could not leave any chance to save him. Before the movie began, I was surprised to find that there were only ten people in the cinema one Friday night shortly after it opened in Japan. After 30 minutes, I was surprised that they stayed. I stayed to have the right to criticize him. The whole film was punctuated by my moans and laughter of disbelief of my Japanese girlfriend. All the people I saw coming out of this cinema had an air of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> To the directors of this film, you owe me two hours.
