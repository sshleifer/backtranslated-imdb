This film spoils the talents of almost all actors in what could be called charitably a "cauldron". <br /> <br /> Despite the opening of the film "Top Gun" full of activities, everything is in free fall with many stereotypes and unlikely situations succeeding until you try to choke with your pop -Corn. <br /> <br /> There are so many dead stories in this film that I guessed at one point. <br /> <br /> Quinn's role as Mexican drug lord in Mexico is laughable and his "associates" were removed from the Quinn-Martin police show of the 1970s. Costner's character is made of wood and we gives no reason to believe that he really fell in love with Mendez's wife. Nor are we persuaded convincingly that the woman is looking for company and skips the first hot body. <br /> <br /> Definitely, a film "B" at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved.
