First, the IFC manages Town and Country and now this. The difference between this stinker and the scam of the pink panther is that Town and Country was observable. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the actors have registered to do so so that they can complain in Europe in the place of someone else. Belushi is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (making a Grade Z Dom DeLuise) was a torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of unskilled Shepherd, and I bet the Gitmo prisoners would crack like nuts! woman taking a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy this, I have a beachfront property in Arizona that might interest you!
