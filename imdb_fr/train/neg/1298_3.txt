Sogo Ishii can be a qualified filmmaker in good conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a descendant of the Genji clan. The production of the film presents the main features of a low-budget production, including fuzzy fight scenes and awkward montages (the kind you might find in a by-product movie). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his destiny is to defeat the mysterious spirit that protects Gojoe's bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will put him in direct conflict with almost all elements of society at this time - but could win him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is, however, no lack of ambition in the description of the conflict between the saint and the mundane. Artsy flourishes in photography and editing helps offset the loose shooting style. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
