I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a pay cut, Warner Bros. replicated by placing it in inferior projects for the remainder of his contract. She decided to take the money. But his career has suffered. <br /> <br /> That could explain what she was doing in "Comet Over Broadway". (Although this does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are also in the movie.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this movie, and it's exactly in the goals. The murder trial. His shady vaudeville career. His success in London. His last scene with his daughter. No party leads logically to the next part. <br /> <br /> In addition, the sets and costumes looked like movie B. And her hair! Turner shows a lot of his films this month. Look at any other and you will make a favor.
