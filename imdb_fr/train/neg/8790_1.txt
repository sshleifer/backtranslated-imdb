I saw it recently on the cable and I enjoyed it a bit. I read the reviews here and it seems that everyone loves the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad it was not extended.) The second story, I thought, was clich√©d. And this "California Dreaming", if I hear again ... Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something the mainstream audience will understand, like "Crouching Tiger".
