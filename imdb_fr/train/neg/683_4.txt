Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and misses something in her life. She competes in Miss France against the wishes of her boyfriend André (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She leaves for the title of Miss Europe, leaving her boyfriend behind her. She wins again but goes back to André because he asked him. Once back together, her life becomes banal again so one night, she writes a note and leaves to live the experience of the celebrity that awaits her as Miss Europe. Andre follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent film accompanied by a musical track on the piano. It is also accelerated, so everything seems to go fast. The limited dialogue was added later and that is very false. The actors agree that it is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes at the end, but the story lasts a bit too long. After watching this, I'm not really sure about Louise Brooks' interest: she has a terrible haircut that makes her look greasy. I do not need to watch again.
