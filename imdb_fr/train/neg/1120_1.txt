I saw this film in my class of international cinema and I was disgusted. This film is nothing more than a scene of blatant shock after another. <br /> <br /> The 4th Man talks about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his imminent danger. He meets a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and decides to stay with her only when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. Clearly, Reve loves the Dutch sausage. So, Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so that he can finally have sex with him. But her subsequent discovery that Christine had 3 previous husbands, who she has all murdered. Now, Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be "THE 4th MAN". The scenario makes sense without intrigue holes. The editing and all that is technical about this film is perfectly correct. The film is simply disgusting and I felt the need to vomit in some places. Basically, it's not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Reve coming out of bed just in a t-shirt. Thus, at the very beginning, you can see the charming Pecker de Reve collapse as he strolls into his narrow apartment in a state of hangover. Later, he has a dream where his pecker is cut by a pair of scissors, and they show it with the resulting blood fountain. Reve caresses a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. In addition, there is a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies put together. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the "shocking" scenes, but this film is so blatant when it comes to shocking. The entire film revolves around the shock value. <br /> <br /> So, if it's your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away far away far away from this one. My mind is still marked.
