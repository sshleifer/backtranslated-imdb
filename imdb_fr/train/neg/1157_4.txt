I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who had rented the movie only about the appearance of Snoop Dogg (a passionate fetish) on the cover. Naturally, I did not expect much. I thought the film would include the typical picture of Snoop Dogg-related behaviors and images, often seen in rap clich√© videos. However, my generalization was generally wrong. Unfortunately, it did not improve the movie. <br /> <br /> Most people would describe the film as a dark and serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark and seriously boring film. The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own masterpieces. Their opposing lifestyles end up forming an improbable but extremely complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film like a wild Russian mountain - most of which is due to Snoop's character - reminiscent of one who suffers from a severe case of double personality disorder. And while the film is a drama, Snoop and company's acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - was more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to those who are attentive. altered because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue afterwards. There are mediocre conflicts, but even these are mostly mired in more dialogue. The end, however, jumped on me with a sudden surprise. It was a bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that was to end. While watching the end credits, I could not help but imagine the director thinking: "Oh my God, how on earth can I stop this snoozer?" By the way, the director has presented carefully crafted tricks and subtleties leading up to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo on a street full of dwarves wearing black pullovers.
