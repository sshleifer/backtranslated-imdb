First of all, let me tell you that this is not the movie for those looking to watch something happy and happy during the holidays. This film is cold, brutal and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grumpy mother who is at Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their homes, they can not buy Christmas gifts for children, etc. You have the idea, happy things for the holidays. Harry Dean Stanton then appears as the Christmas angel Gideon. The latter, wearing his dark hat and long overcoat, looks more like a pedophile who observes throughout the day. What better way to instill Mary Steenburgen's Christmas spirit than to kill her family and then offer her to bring her back if she believes again in Christmas. Santa is a master singer and his Christmas workshop is more like a refuge for Nazi refugee refugees. The film is so thick that you do not care about the happy ending because the rest of the movie is so bitter and amazing. I'm sure this film wanted to look like Capra, but he left out the joy and the feeling that a holiday movie should have.
