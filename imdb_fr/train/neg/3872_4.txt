The film never becomes intolerable to watch. And to be clear, this has nothing to show either, except maybe part of the sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy character and not sexy that reveals dresses rather sexy. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see both ways. There is no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialogue, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring places and very bland game. Kevin Dillon is totally nil. Silverstone ... well, I did not focus too much on his role, I admit. Yet, as I said earlier, if you have nothing to do except watch a movie, it will not look so bad. 4/10
