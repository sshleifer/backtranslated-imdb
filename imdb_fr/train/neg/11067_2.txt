I'm a big fan of the real detective genre, but I could not miss this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was destined to be erotic, up to the porn-cop soundtrack. There was no look at what had motivated Dahmer, no exploration of his victims. Just "Look like this guy is scary." And I have to give this to the filmmakers - their Dahmer is the scariest thing that has ever denied the screen.
