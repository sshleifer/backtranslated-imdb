This film should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In the space. But he was dragging, had inimitable characters and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally thrown into space by one of their robot friends (aptly named Jinx). The scenes in the space are long, repetitive (the same accident occurs twice) and unreasonable or scary depending on your point of view. The adults will get bored and go astray, the kids might be scared, because the way this was filmed really leaves a strange sense about it. <br /> <br /> There is a new love story, but unlike the shuttle - it never takes off. Why is it included in the first place is unclear, except perhaps to add extra tension between the characters - but that will fail if it was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be weird and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is great. But no, she was irritating and of average appearance. Not someone you would like to go to, whether you are a friend or even a model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really lucky not to have appeared in the cinema this performance. Maybe he can play Mikey in Life Cereal ads, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It's not part of the screen and I do not think we can identify it at home. In fact, I would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to anyone.
