I read James Hawes's book. It was pretty cool, not great, but entertaining enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had a clue what was happening, and it was still amazing with this knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally, all the elements of this film are catastrophic, which I do not do. have the ability to describe. The half-digested fish could have made a better movie with matches and a dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since, as a movie, I felt so angry. The mattress suites were very close, but even they never reached such nauseating and frightful depth as this hold. <br /> <br /> Since I lost 90 minutes of my life testifying to this plague on the human being, I am now unable to look at any James Hawes book without feeling angry. This is the depth of hate I have for this piece of shit. No, it's unfair. Allow me to apologize to all the feces for comparing you to the evil of another world that is rancid aluminum. <br /> <br /> A cancer pure and simple occurred in the world of the cinema.
