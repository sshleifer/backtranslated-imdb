During the civil war, divided loyalties were numerous; it is obvious that many have occurred "in border states", where North and South met by chance. From the border, the young father Owen Moore goes to join the army of the Union. Shortly thereafter, Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, walks on enemy property, desperate for lack of water; he finds a reserve where the daughter of unionist Gladys Egan sits. When the Yankee soldiers stalk him, little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate seal to hide. Later, when he returns to kill his father, we will remember the kindness of the little girl. A sweet little story of director D.W. Griffith Images of place and humanity are exhibited with love. <br /> <br /> **** In the Border States (13/06/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore and Gladys Egan
