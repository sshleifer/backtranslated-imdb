Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that the game is so bad, these actors usually give a good show. The cast was poorly done, it made you wait for something (I will not tell you what). The main character was awful ... I do not know where they found her. Anyway, get away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, it's a Swedish action of great quality.
