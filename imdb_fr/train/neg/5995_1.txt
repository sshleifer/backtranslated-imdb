It's a really awful movie. What they did was catch up on a TV show, which was never directed at young children and which earned him the treatment of George Lucas (that is, he was spoiled by a joke to please the young audience). <br /> The Thunderbirds television series was not really the most cerebral, it was actually a nice formula, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models blew themselves up) and the distribution of the voice n was not too bad. <br /> <br /> It suffers from bad casting and bad acting (with the notable exception of Sophia Myles in the role of Lady Penelope & Ron Cook in the role of Parker, who seem to be the only members of the cast to have an idea of ​​how their characters should be played) & After this masquerade, I would not let Frakes direct the traffic. <br /> <br /> The main interest of the Thunderbirds was that it was the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or rescuing people involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give them 1 in 10 because a zero rate is not supported.
