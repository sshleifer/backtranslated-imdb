It's probably the most boring, the worst and the most useless movie I've seen last year. The plot supposed to have some philosophical aspects appeared to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with many clich√©s: the policeman lone wolf, handsome, psychologically disturbed, who sleeps with his firearm ... and shy, but pretty scientist, you add a plot of 2 cents and you have me, Robot! The obvious advertising of brands like FedEx, Audi, Converse, etc. Terribly bothered me. This film stinks of commercialization and tends to be rather a mediocre commercial which, unfortunately, will not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend that to my worst enemy. If you have some free time, look for a good TV program or read a good book instead.
