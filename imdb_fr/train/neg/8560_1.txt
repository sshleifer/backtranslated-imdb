What time do we live when someone like this Joe Swan-no matter what the hell is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all! Where are the new filmmakers with brains AND talents ??? We need it, and the hell! Mocker! <br /> <br /> This film does not talk about anything, just as the characters in the movie are worthless. It is this horrible so-called Generation Y that is full of bored idiots, some of whom declare themselves filmmakers without worrying about learning anything before shooting. Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current movies like these show how stupid young so-called "filmmakers" can be when they think they go out without script, without direction, without thought, without real "camerawork" (everything turns horribly DV), no job Editor, nothing, means filming "rebel" or "advanced". No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just the sheer masturbation of the movies (and there's actually a "hoot" in the face, so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Watch the first films of any accomplished "independent" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... none were so tedious and aimless this, however, Swan, no matter what the hell, always goes to SXSW every year and is hailed as a kind of talent, new talent. It's dung! I can not imagine anyone like that, and all that this so-called filmmaker did (everything I saw) is just as bad (the new creation was clearly designed to appeal to a more traditional, one of the callers of the sitcom). Be clear unless you're a friend or family member of the people involved ... Well, if you're a family member or friend, you'd probably be embarrassed to see a member of family or friend in such compromising situations ... <br /> <br /> Immaculate waste. This is not art. This is the ultimate opposite of it.
