Uh ... this movie was bad. A LOT. <br /> <br /> I read some of the other reviews. Apparently, many people think that everything Woody Allen writes or interprets is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I watched many of his films, hoping to miss something. But no, they are just void. Badly written trash. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to say rather stupid). The plot is ... I think it's supposed to be mysterious. Not sure about it. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, on any movie you've seen from his movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, check out this movie. If you are under 50, do not worry. (If you're a Woody Allen fan AND you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical, I do not know what to say.)
