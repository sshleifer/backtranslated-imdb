Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this film was a scam of the Japanese Ringu. Well, I guess the United States also wrote the version, but at least it was a pure and simple remake. So, so sad. I really like watching Filipino films and I know that great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe it should happen. Claudine and Kris are such big names over there, surprised to see that they would be affiliated with plagiarism. To aspiring filmmakers in the Philippines: you do not have to stoop to make money. There are a lot of moviegoers watching movies Filipinos put out and enjoy!
