I was hoping that this film would be at least viewable. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting a lot more considering the composition of the cast (I wonder if any of them will include it in his CV?). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is certainly Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and complete.
