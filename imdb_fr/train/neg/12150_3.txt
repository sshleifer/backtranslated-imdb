Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombies trying to recover your hard-earned money. Suggestion? Keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say that the good old TheatreX took one for the team. Guess what plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though, for reasons of originality (?), This film is set in Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie based in Rhode Island. A government-controlled television channel would broadcast so-called "normal" broadcasts, so that the remaining citizens will not think that there is a problem in the world, that is, those who are not watching never or not go out, anyway. I will say however that some commercials broadcast by this station have probably been the most fun part of this movie. There is actually a story about it, but that does not bother me because, after a while, you do not care or you fell asleep. Anyway, there are a lot of terrible things to put in scene to put forward everything that was "seen before everything" and is trotted in front of the camera. Believe me, you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watching this. 3 out of 10
