What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of pictures I've seen in a long time. Not that I saw a lot. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes looking for a stiff drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many expressions hurt and tortured can a person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were, as often, totally ruined. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? In trying to be politically correct, this film still applies racial stereotypes. (An inexperienced and brave solitary music teacher teaches violin to underprivileged children at a neighborhood school). The kids were not cute! I just wrote to match the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. true horror that one!
