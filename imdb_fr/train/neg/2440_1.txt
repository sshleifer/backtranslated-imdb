Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he also tried the cinema. But this incredible piece of scrap has ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a football woman, television host and program director. In fact, I saw him in a theater (almost empty) because I was a fan of Koen Wouters' group, Clouseau. I regret so much to spend money on it. It sounds cheap, it's a terrible story and it's badly executed in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found that it was an incredible waste of time and money.
