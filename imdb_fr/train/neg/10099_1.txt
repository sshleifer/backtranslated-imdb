Thank God! I did not waste my money renting it but I downloaded it! It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life, with visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Away from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many loop holes and mistakes in the movie. OK, if you have time after reading this comment, please consult the director's profile (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I understand why the film is like that, I mean that every film made by Ulli Lommel gets a score between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to look for what kind of movies are these- this, but finish all this by saying a strong sentence. Even for fun or time passing or even in a situation of extreme boredom, please DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.
