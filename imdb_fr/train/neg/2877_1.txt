My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention sharing an office with him. When it was announced that he was BTK, she was shocked. All day was just for her telling how she would never have seen him as the Wichita killer. I heard her say a few times. I asked her a lot and went to all the interviews she was invited to. I read the whole book about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another BTK movie on TV not so long ago I thought it might have been a better description of Dennis' murders and perhaps his motives were even intelligent. <br /> <br /> I will be very direct with the flaws of this film. This is based on my mother's portrait of him, all my readings about him and the videotapes I saw talking to him. <br /> <br /> First, the viewing angles were horrible. It looked like the camera had been shot at home. The acting was terrible and I could not even stand to watch it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a type of "follow the rules". He was not as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, professional. The same goes for his murders, to our knowledge. If you saw his confession in court, you can already guess. And what about the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No, I never read or Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with cruelty to animals or crushing insects. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs methods of choking. Yet, throughout the film, he placed animals on his victim's face and acted as if he cared for their well-being. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he confessed, but in the film during his first murder, he tells the lady that he knows her too. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to get into this movie, and I'm already screaming. This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in BTK news. This is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want a half-porn badly shot with some scenes of massacres, then this is your kind of movie.
