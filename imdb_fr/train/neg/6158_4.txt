Once upon a time, in the mid-90s, I was writing for the DOCTOR WHO fanzines and everyone held their breath on the new American producer DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the Doctor's sworn enemy, the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts, everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed, "Who is Eric Roberts?" I had to point out that it was before the creation of the BDIM that all you had to do was type a name on this site, but their helpful soul wrote in a publication for which I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for his role in playing alongside Murray Abraham, the film was called BY THE SWORD and spoke of a fencing school. Looking back now, Roberts is best known for the POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and the RUNAWAY TRAIN, but that did not stop the one who put the boot on both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and was determined to make this American master with his pulling south go to a debacle. Strangely, most of the fans were furious to see Roberts play against Master, but after seeing DOCTOR WHO TVM, many fans (including myself) thought that Roberts' performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production. <br /> <br /> Yeah I`m parting but BY THE SWORD was a movie I wanted to see just because it was the first time I heard Eric Roberts but I did not have the chance to see him until this weekend and I was quite disappointed. he . I do not know anything about fencing (everyone on this page has the duty to mention it, whether it does it or not, I do not do it), so I do not know how accurate it is, but as mentioned, the film seems somewhat anachronistic, even if you saw it when it was released in 1991, the hairstyles seem obsolete for some years, as well as its mixed distribution of teenagers doing a little dance routine that you asked if it would have worked better if it had been produced Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid-1980s. One could say that this would have meant that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard was off center for most of the film, but I was not convinced of their love / hate relationship and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performances before and since.
