Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to get the dog out ... I can not believe I looked at everything. I imagined that I was anticipating with optimism that it would improve. Horribly disjointed dialogue, pathetic game and totally improbable events. Like Toby's mother clinging to Col, to get on and off in a room with a 24-foot ceiling, without chairs, counters, or anything around her motionless, suspended body on which she could have The girl who played the girl from the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the first couple's puppy was a close second. The basic scenario has potential and, with a good script and a good director, could be a really disturbing film, but this version is unfortunately not. I am more afraid when I open my electricity bill every month.
