"Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms," ​​reports a suspect in "The Seedpeople," an idiotic and flabby remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers," "The Day of the Triffids," and about a thousand moovies of udders. And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, could we ask? Because, according to the same mistake, "seeds can drive us away". Yes, I remember a horrible incident where the MooCow was just a calf, chased out of school by a voracious dandylion seed ... Yeah, that's right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" of this shabby little turkey are somehow like tiny shaggy muppets, some of which turn like diabolical barrels, others flying on ropes. There is not even the slightest hint of terror or suspense. For reasons that remain unexplained, monster monsters are neutralized by 50-volt ultraviolet light, although they can move in daylight, which contains about 1,000,000,000,000 times of UV energy. As you can see, this flop of cow has received little attention. The MooCow says you need to weed your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
