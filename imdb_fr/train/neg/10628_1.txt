This so-called "documentary" tries to tell that the United States simulated the landing on the moon. Year right. <br /> <br /> All those who have actually studied the case know different cases. <br /> <br /> First, there is irrefutable proof. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought back a LOT of kilos of moon rocks - for geological studies. These have been tested around the world by hundreds of laboratories. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not the Earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on Earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the Moon. THAT IS TO SAY. conspiracy theorists never study anything: they take only what corresponds to their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another erroneous statement on their part is that they had wind in the hangar where they fired the lunar landing, THAT IS TO SAY the flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it by the hand, so he moved. And what proves it: if the conspiracy theorists even studied the images, they would see that the NE flag will NEVER move after the astronaut left it, IE the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study correctly, or study it only until they have what they are looking for, to be able to lie and make a profit (ie what is called the "documentary" ). <br /> <br /> According to one statement, it is impossible to film the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, the artificial lighting of the studio. Once again, conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same thing would happen in a terrestrial desert at night, without any source of light. But I doubt that all the conspiracy theorists have spent more days outside their grandmother's basement. More days than a Star Treck convention already takes place. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So, they invent all these lies to seem important - it's a fact.
