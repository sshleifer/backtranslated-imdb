War, Inc. - Companies take control of the war in the future and use lone murderer Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to perform their tough jobs against rival CEOs. A black comedy satirizing the army and the companies. It was often difficult to understand exactly what was happening. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason or method to insanity. <br /> <br /> Cusack regards him as the "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. That is to say, the war is more or less a confrontation. We see Cusack again as an assassin protecting * spoiler * the person he is supposed to kill when he clings to his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks credible enough to release half a dozen guys with relative ease. The brief fights are going well. The rest of the movie does not do it. All this is weird, often bizarre. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody, and too dynamic for anyone to even think of the movie's message, which could be the heartless way in which societies, such as war factions, are compete and plan without losing sight of how they affect average citizens. Interesting, but satire just does not work, because it's not funny and basically, the film has no heart. We are supposed to make fun of the impact of the war on the shell of a Cusack character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by the war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. His character pinches pungent sauce and drives the smallest private plane, but quirks are meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei is a romantic journalist. There is really not a lot of chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and is not ridiculed. Joan Cusack just screaming, moaning and getting high. Blech. Ben Kingsley could be forced to return to the Oscars if he does not start giving a decent performance from time to time. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> This is not a terrible film, but in the end, you have to ask "The war, what is it for?" Absolutely nothing. C-
