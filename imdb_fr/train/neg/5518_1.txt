I did not see that, and I do not intend to see this movie or any other movie including Lindsay ...... unless & until "poor little rich girl" prepares for a period of 2 years beginning with the most recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone who has gone to see any of Lindsay's recent movies. I imagine that 2007 will be the highlight of her career in filmmaking, until she cleans up her movie. All the recent advertising has only hurt her film career, if she still had the desire to make more films. Until then, film producers have actively sought Lindsay for a role in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to audition and argue for any role. His reputation is currently "poisonous" and quite possible could have a negative effect on ticket sales at the box office regardless of the film in which it runs. <br /> <br /> Sooooo ... now, Lindsay will have to take care of "not being wanted" ..... will she be able to handle that? <br /> <br /> I wonder if Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my opinion. I do not have any insider information.
