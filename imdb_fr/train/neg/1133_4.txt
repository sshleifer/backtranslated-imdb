I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts of one. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play manner, inserted strictly to conform to the genre of romantic comedy. Generally, it suits us because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge is usually to make it original, new and inventive. This film can not do it. <br /> <br /> There is no idea who the characters really are, with the exception of Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They enter this one-dimensional clich√© and are no more than mere puppets serving a very light story. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film can become annoying, the rhythm is lacking, and the editing is filled with useless close-ups. I should also mention the scenery too stylized making some scenes devoid of any natural, or rather, making the attempt to appear naturally too obvious. Of course, with that, you have a sandy music just-for-cue which, unfortunately, often sounds often inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I can not believe a film that alludes to Woody Allen becomes so misleading. If you're expecting a good light romantic comedy, that's not it. Or rather, it's a bad attempt. You will not leave the movie theater theater unless you wonder why this film is so highly praised when the cinema is over 100 years old and many of Quebec's top filmmakers make better films. <br /> <br /> what it is. But it's bad if you consider cinema as an art and directors as an author.
