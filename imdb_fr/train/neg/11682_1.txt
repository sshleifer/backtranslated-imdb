Now is not it? Considering all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film has never turned into a mere copy of horrible movies. Yes some jokes, no absolutely unpredictable twists, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are there, because the director and the editor have made stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why the hell did they dig a hole inside this safe, who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the cell in question, it could just to make me spend a day, but it seems that Spike is asking us to take too many things in this one for granted, and not to raise the eyebrows when something looks stupid ... it's just another contract studio with movie relax, and enjoy ...
