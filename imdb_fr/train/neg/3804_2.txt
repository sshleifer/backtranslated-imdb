It's a bad movie in every way. The story of Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing aroused a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic English murder and exploring what can be done). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, has none of that. It's badly written, both tracks are desperately wooden and the story itself has no interest. The kind of parody requires at least some sort of subplot with explanations and spiritual connections (why are tarot cards and keys kept locked in a locked room?). <br /> <br /> The delightful and witty versions of Allen's various Hollywood genres (curse of the jade scorpion / purple pink Cairo, etc.) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration abandoned him this time.
