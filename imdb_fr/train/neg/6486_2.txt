If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's his incredible ability to take a story and tell it again and again. Even watching the ad for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney is going to ruin one of its most impressive classics. There was even this scene of spaghetti meatballs. This has been done before! And that's what I say to this unfortunate direct to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even many of Bluth's very bad movies. The pair of penguins and walruses (I've even forgotten their names) is a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats almost all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abominable. I have never heard such bad songs from them so far. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the positive side, at least they took the time to make the animation a little decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as before (or maybe it's a disadvantage for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is so cute that you could throw up. I almost did it. Do a favor to yourself and to your Little Mermaid fan. Do not waste your money on that. Admittedly, it is not as horrible as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it is little consolation.
