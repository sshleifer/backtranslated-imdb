No laughing whatsoever. Yes, I watched all the sinking of the train, but only to not ask myself later if Cleese had come to my senses in the last part. (No, he did not.) <br /> <br /> It may be historically interesting for young people to see that this British "humor" includes black "jokes" like these , thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What surprises me even more is to read the comments of other commentators, who recognize that it is not very good, but who turn around and give him high votes. If the vast majority of comedies you've seen are even worse than this one, then I certainly pity your tortuous lives. <br /> <br /> The level of humor of this show seems to address the small children, but not the subject. So who is it for? People who like repeated and slow double-taps, fools, jokes about drugs (interesting only for a short trip back in 1977) and other "low" moods. The Three Stooges are always funny, and have been for me too. They made efforts to make the jokes work. This is however cleared of schlock. I'm afraid this is the end of civilization, if this thing is really accepted as valid. Then you will tell me that tabloid television is popular. :(
