Okay. Look, I've seen A LOT and I mean MANY of these types of movies. You know, those where the jacket of the DVD is so beautiful and so awesome that you can not WAIT to see it? Well, I'm GOT again. And I'm getting tired of it. But I go astray. It's pretty simple. It was bad (I know, rather young) but it did. And I agree so much with the other poster that if we were to stay silent, why, WHY should the lead actress be so unattractive? Which is distracting, if I may add. And the scowling look she was using reflected unresolved grief / sorrow after her daughter's death had not helped. I mean, Jesus ... Oh, but the demon thing crawling on his back was pretty cool ...
