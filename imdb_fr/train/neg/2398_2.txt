As a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane", I saw that because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the ones mentioned above. FALSE CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> Not only is it not funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad in a pleasant but nice way, but really. It's bad-bad. The script does not contain a single fun line, which is more the case when you try to entertain your audience with humor. <br /> <br /> The impediment of speech by Adam Arkin is probably the most annoying thing in this film. Nevertheless, this cruelty of nature does not prevent it from being throughout the film and it is hard not to look in the camera. This non-charismatic lover fits well with the constant inconsistencies and storytelling - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think about Jay Leno, another evening host, who still refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few Leno movies and it's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines he gave. I'm not easily frightened by bad comedies, so I kept looking and looking for all the jokes about every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film actually becomes a sort of comedy as Alan Arkin takes over. - He does it literally: From 75 minutes in the film, he is in all scenes. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When movies try to make you think that their lack of professionalism is why you're supposed to like them because they have the right intention, they remind students that I did not not prepared for examination. In these cases, you must remain strict and the note must be an "F". (But please, do not assume I'm a teacher, it's a respectable job somewhere between the politician and the child molester.) <br /> <br /> If you're really looking for a Horror / scifi movie friendly and likeable, fun to watch and contains jokes try Bruce Campbell's "Man with the Cries Brain". Or look at Sunshine / Core if you prefer the shallow and modern SciFi Schlock. These are just as funny, but unintentionally.
