Unless you are between 10 and 14 years old (with the exception of R), there is very little to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should really see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be in considering her environment, but unfortunately that's it. Poor land. Bad game. Worst writing and delivery. The special effects are lamentable. Although the situation as a whole is a strange and terrible joke, individual important individual situations are all equally terrible. If you look at the action parts, there are incredible action sequences in some movies that make you dizzy and others that make you moan. This film contains only the last type. This leaves little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite all the hype, I can read and think, while I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a little worried about entering. Yet, like a shipwreck, you can not just look away. And even without expectations, I was disappointed. Wrong. Not so bad, it's good material. I'm very tolerant of bad movies, but it makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) worthy of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of over CGI'd is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, little man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 mystifies me completely. Brainwashing or stacking the electoral system is all that I can think of as an answer. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that tonight I saw a train accident. I have to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10
