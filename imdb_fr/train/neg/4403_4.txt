Whatever the merits of the film, the research is insufficient. As others have pointed out, the film shows Iranians speaking in Arabic rather than Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for anyone with any knowledge of the region or country. The landscape could not be different from the real landscape. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: it is shown that a train is traveling in Afghanistan, while the latter does not have a railway. The Turkish ambassador wears a Fez (the red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey well before the beginning of the film. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed in Indian and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I guess the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman and that the sari was what they decided to make it exotic.
