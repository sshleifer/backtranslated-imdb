Sixth getaway for Freddy Krueger in which he finally managed to kill virtually all Springwood youth; now he wants to expand his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do it. <br /> <br /> A failure as a horror movie because it just has nothing to be afraid of. Works better like a grim dark comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all his ability to cool this viewer. (Too much nonsense, for sure.) The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and a visibly depressing Kotto Yappet Kotto) and there are simply too many visual effects. The final is OK but does not provide as many sparks as one might expect. <br /> <br /> Adding a new twist to the story of the dream killer, this gives Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup. scenes more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Some cameos worthy of mention: a Roseanne and Tom Arnold joint camoe lacking any entertainment value, an appropriate Alice Rock rock shock appearance, and a funny cameo Johnny Depp who recognizes somehow the icon of the pop he had become. <br /> <br /> Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about replaying the key scenes from previous entries is the end credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
