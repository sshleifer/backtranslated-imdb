This film is the longest film and the record. It had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I guess no one had the courage to do something like this. <br /> <br /> The film as the title suggests is based on Kargil's war but the problem is that there are too many characters and that the secondary and romantic intrigues and songs of many characters are boring < <br /> <br /> Even if there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knives, who does this? <br /> <br /> Directed by JP Dutta in front of BORDER The music goes well <br /> <br /> Among the large distribution, Ajay Devgan stands proudly, Saif is very good on his side and also his first movie with kareena, Abhishek is friendly Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is lost, Suneil is fine Akshaye Khanna is doing his share and rest is passable Rani is good, Esha is ok the rest are passable
