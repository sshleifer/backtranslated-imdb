I should not even re-read this film, since it is not a horror film and therefore does not deserve the attention of Dr. Cheese. At least, it's not a horror in the usual sense. It's definitely a horrible proposition to waste your time watching this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, it's true. in clear terms, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many flaws, but they were not all unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem of the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's refusal to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make really scary movies that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just a mixture of filmmakers' imagination (usually dull and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made a film about physics, for example, but did not just misapply the basic laws of physics, but also the scenario as a whole, you'd be fed up with the useless intrigue that results. The same goes for this kind of films. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar films preceding it) invents stories about the Catholic Church and Christian faith and attempt. to build a plot of these inventions. Unsurprisingly, the plot ends up being inconsistent and stupid. This film has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as the growth of your nails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this stuffy heap.
