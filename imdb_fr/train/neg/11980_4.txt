This one was ruined by very big potentially very short matches. <br /> <br /> The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I guess the only way to get them out of Demolition was a double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect should have worked overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And it was the third consecutive ppv where Perfect jobbed. Do not forget that before, he had never lost a match. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, maybe the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights, pinning the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put on a new heel (do you remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). It was a taste of Bret Hart's bachelor career, coming back from two-on-one and almost surviving the match. He and DiBiase organized a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the goal of the match was DiBiase's boring quarrel with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the Visionaries were the first team to survive all of its members (and only the second since 87 to have four survivors), this match was not a squash. It was the longest match of the night and Jake repeated his 1988 performance when he was alone against four men and dominated. I think he could have really created a surprise. These days, the match would have ended in reverse. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest matches ever played in SS was also one of the most surprising. Perhaps the most underrated wrestler of all time, Tito Santana was the inspiring wrestler of the night, putting his war paint on and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the Warlord in the last survival game. It was so strange to see him so crushed, then return to his poor career. Sgt. Slaughter also performed well by eliminating Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but that was no surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only goal of the survival game was to win Hogan and Warrior's victory in the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the games were too short. The beginnings of the Undertaker were cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this one.
