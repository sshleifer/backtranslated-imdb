I'm sorry but I did not like this doc. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously do not have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real insights are offered. The footage is not assembled in a very informative way either. It's a shame because it is a movie that really deserves special haunting features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rosselini becomes more beautiful as she grows older. All considered, this gives only a "4".
