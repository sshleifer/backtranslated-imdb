This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others believe he has understood. Anyone trying to make sense of this is a MORON! My advice would be to take TWO shots of very strong acid and at least you will have a visual thrill! Even if in the end you risk killing yourself for wasting your acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those who will want to defend the film. Inintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. The film is ice, with paper on the destination with clouds that sound, on a sunny dive in the pudding ... It looks like a lion in a red light with seeing the hair. Now, explain that to me !!!!
