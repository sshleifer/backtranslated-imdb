I could not wait to see Nana after watching Renoir's first feature film, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered his best silent movie, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it was a huge step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. His game is on top, even for a silent movie. His game is more like what you would expect in a film of early adolescence, not in the late twenties. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry) of someone with constipation. It was also very hard to believe that a man would fall in love with this femme fatale. She was not charming. <br /> <br /> The film was also quite long, the work with the camera was irrelevant (apart from shooting a horse race) and editing was boring. The story reminded me of Pandora's Pandora Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. The Pandora's box simply marks at all levels where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is reserved for Renoir's Completist or very great fans of silent films.
