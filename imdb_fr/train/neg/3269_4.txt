With the exception of the role of Meryl Streep, which is remarkable as always, I would avoid this film because it has a quality of "Film of the week" dated on it. But it's worth looking at if you keep in mind the different sub-floors: how a couple withstands the study of the media and how are treated different. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the problem is that of credibility. Australians are different from "us" (most people in the world), so we (most of us) do it automatically with an air of "weirdness". The couple involved is religious (different from most people in culture) and Adventist (different). So their way of life and their state of mind are suspicious to start. Dingos are animals different from other dogs, so again we are faced with issues of strangeness. So the real story is the way in which society (and the world) deals with the different, those with different accents, different beliefs, and how we treat what they say as suspicious. <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" no laughing and there are humorous messages, unfortunately, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the film, it was discovered (as you will see in the web searches) that much larger children were hunted down by dingoes. Research done by experts in dingos showed that it was not only possible but very likely that the baby was taken by dingos (maybe a pair), cleverly extracted clothes and consumed in a few moments without leaving trace. <br /> <br /> But what's left is the question of why people defended the dingoes when they discovered they were endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children, why, because that the affect (expression) of a woman is so cold that she is supposed guilty, and on and on. <br /> <br /> Haunting questions, with or without the film.
