Moralism with heavy hands. Writers use characters as spokespersons to speak for themselves. Predictable, difficult terrain points (say five times faster). Imitation of Britney Spears by a child. This film has all the characteristics of a special rejection for life. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo have decided to create an emotional and stimulating film on a difficult subject, thus exploring are not always in black and white, that a criminal by definition does not is not necessarily a bad human being and there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when putting the child's welfare first. However, their seriousness ends up being channeled into a dialogue preached and banal situations sown to advance the plot. The decent production values ​​and the interesting use of documentary type sequences are not enough for the objective to be achieved when the scenario and the actor fall flat. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create a tension: Soid first tries to make Pablo sing so that he participates in his documentary in exchange for his help to escape, then, in the same breath , basically tells him not to trust him, because it does not help them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is much too shaken by a tantrum. The well-being of Cristina is so important to him that he is fleeing his capture, his prison or his deportation, but he is willing to risk all that to appease her when she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk over too permissive parenting. Third, when Charlie, Pablo's employer, gives Detective Bright the phone, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? Oh, yes, I would have surrendered. CCH Pound's detective Wims could wipe the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would like to list things that I like. Uh, I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf is called Sexy. There is disguise, always a plus; juvenile disguise, not less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the film must be when Cristina launched the Not-So-Bright detective. I also find it interesting that in a very minority cast (which I appreciate a lot, by the way), the black character is the racist. Too bad it's just thrown out there and it is not explored further. <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive and unconventional score, but it is nonetheless generally non-contextual, not reinforcing mood or tension in any scene, with the exception of the pathetic, anguished moan. whenever the main character is in anguish, as if he thought his acting did not show him enough: "Just in case you do not know it, he's upset and we have the musical clues for prove it. <br /> <br /> A cliché and elevated dialogue leads to a depressing lack of subtext, everything must be explained in the dialogue, even when the body language was in place until it was perfectly For example, each impassioned speech by Pablo and Mrs. Knight's reproaches that her child will not go to bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> "Papi, talk to me again about mom "What a shame, a blatant show of the generic dead woman!" (She's still the most beautiful woman the widower has ever seen, the kindest he's ever met.) Why do not we see a man crying a woman like that of Shakespeare? She may be fat, ugly, odi euse, but her love for her is there is a story that will upset me.) <br /> <br /> The police still literally a step behind it gives many scenes the misplaced feeling of a French farce . Most of the boring feet chases - Bright and Lightning are so distorted and easy to deceive (it's certainly not as fast as lightning, and she, well, I do not feel the need to clarify things ). A guy dragging a little kid over the policeman on the bike, the macho biker fighting for a fight before being shot by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, it's so sad. Will we ever see it in 'Cops'? <br /> <br /> Deus ex machina hackneyed and over the top: as an employer, would you really give up on checking his green card only because he can quote the author of the Inspirational Quote on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> In addition, several scenes, including the one above, threaten to turn into porn: "I'll do this favor for you as long as you do something for you. almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm. <br /> <br /> When parents watch the filming of Pablo's remorse, the mother-in-law's freak-out is the most real film the film has. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she seems completely influenced by her emotional speech until she becomes ballistic. A more ambivalent appearance would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly amazed by the stupidity of the main character who does things for reasons of intrigue: to hold a convenience store without a mask, to visit the grave of the dead girl. And why does not the mother recognize her face since the day she saw him before leaving ?! "You seem very familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this totally useless and somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificially improved barman? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of useless traits that have never been anywhere, Detective Lightning says skeptical that Detective Bright must be a Scorpion shows how little he knows about occultism. And I do not think that believing in fate is fully qualified as voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright holds Pablo in his death - wait, why does she care now? His character is as inconsistent as Soid's. What, she has to shoot her just because she said 'stop or shoot'? (Until now, she cared so much about her integrity.) He was not armed. There was no need for lethal force. Why not shoot him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina agreed that her mother died as a child, giving Dr. Knight the peace of death of her daughter - forced in this way. And the stratagem of the family whose child was killed is becoming the new family of Cristina ... It makes me angry that she can be a "replacement" for their little girl. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to host the Latin American girl of the man who killed their own daughter. I'm not saying that there are no generous, loving people who would do that. I'm just saying that the characters here are never developed enough for me to believe that they'd do it. <br /> <br /> I find it shocking that another IMDb critic has said that, of course, as a woman, she was moved by Sappy's scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements at times that are not manufactured. <br /> <br /> The co-writer, co-director and co-star Nebot himself said he was wearing too many hats during this production. Too many cooks may spoil the broth, but a single cook could make a special dish after school. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the title of this film has less to do with the story than more with the feeling of regret, helplessness and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.
