Based on Michael Chabon's novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh tells the story of the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer wandering with two friends. It's 1983 and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually thwarted by painful attempts to create a beautiful indie cinematography, the film as a whole gives the impression that the director - whose Dodgeball had already made amusing efforts if it were not commercial advertising - is desperately seeking independent credibility by combining aspects of other independent films, but covering it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many of the films shown at Sundance this year, it seemed like it was a vanity project sponsored by a secret studio intended to help the director gain independent credibility points - he failed in this regard and as a film in its own right.
