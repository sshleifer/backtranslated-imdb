Summarizing: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory on energy production, knowledge that can unbalance the world. He keeps his coded and secret knowledge and desperately wants to leave the Soviet Union. The KGB on the other side desperately wants new technology. So, they set up a scheme. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, the KGB intervenes, takes Markov to a secret location and leads him to reveal his secret by stating that he is in Sweden and working for the UN. As a reinforcement, the KGB kidnaps Markov's separated daughter. The CIA now sends its best agents, a team of Ninjas (Swedish?) To thwart the KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult movie that, although not very good needs to see. The film is quite ambitious but lacks in many areas. First of all, it's very dark, probably to hide places and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what's going on. The second thing that's missing is the martial arts, although it's a ninja movie. Admittedly, there is poor quality, but it is mostly the ninjas who shoot with automatic weapons or explosions. Automatic weapons are also a problem because they seem to have a stock of ammunition ad infinitum. And the ninjas seem almost safe from bullets while the Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What does it say then? Idea and ambition above all else. Some currently, and especially for a Swedish film, decent action scenes but no martial arts. Some nice scenes in slow motion and a lot of blood and gore. And some new technologies of very interesting weapons that explode the heart or brain of the victims. Mainly all the parts you are looking for in a movie B. <br /> <br /> Since this is a movie B, no mistake can be made there. But if you expect it and see it as a B movie, it's entertaining. But do not forget that it's not just a B movie, it's set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, in addition to wearing ... say "interesting" clothes, have deadly doses of eyeshadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In total, see for cult status and ambition. Enjoy it, then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
