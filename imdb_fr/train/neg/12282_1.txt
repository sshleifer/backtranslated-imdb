It was one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. A student has an epidemic of nightmares involving wandering spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to offer a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and classic vampire dishes in the form of a bad 1980s music video, this movie is full of bad actors and extremely slow stories. Although it's such a bad and often laughable film (digging for mullets and this terrible dialogue), it would be a good parody material for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the winner in 1987 the Silver Scroll Award from the Academy of Sicency Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil participates in the film. This is a giant disaster, although followed by a small cult (see the other comments of IMDb for this film).
