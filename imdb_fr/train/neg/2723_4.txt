Claire Denis's films seem to belong to one of two categories: violent and bloody or calm and intimate. "The Intruder" definitely goes into the first category, but it's not so bad that "Trouble Every Day" or "I'm not sleepy". <br /> <br /> Since I saw "Chocolate", I made a point of seeing all the new Denis movies. And I have always been disappointed. "The Intruder" was no exception. She has yet to make a film as personal and as moving as her first. <br /> <br /> You have many of Denis' regulars: a Beatrice Dalle, older but always beautiful, who seems to be in the movie only to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her wide cleavage, and a couple of beautiful coats; the black of "Trouble Every Day" and "I'm not sleepy", Gr√©goire Colin, and this Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was quite interesting, but the camera attracted him so much that I got angry at this lock of curly hair on his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, he was finally cut. <br /> <br /> There was certainly action - horrible murders, looking for a son by a man - and even a conspiracy, but a viewing was not enough to understand it and two views are I'm afraid, out of the question. On the one hand, the score was discordant and invasive (as in "Beau Travail"). On the other hand, the seasons changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused as to what was happening. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you like "Friday night" with his pictures folds in heavy curtains and sheets, you may appreciate the aesthetics of "The Intruder". Otherwise, avoid. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in French and it is possible that I missed something crucial. But dialogue in a Denis film rarely exceeds five pages, double-spaced and with wide margins. In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; in "The Intruder", it's just boring.
