Parodies of horror are not part of the 21st century. Long before the series 'Scary Movie', there were some examples of this kind, mainly in the 80s. But as said franchise, most of these films are hazardous. Some, like "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark", usually go beyond that, but others, like "Saturday 14" and their aftermath can not make you laugh. But among all these types of films, there is a particularly big offender, Transylvania 6-5000, a considerable loss of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> For: A superb distribution that does its best. Part of the dopey humor is fun. A nerdy but catchy theme song. Some good locations in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Naked parcel. Essentially tedious. Most of the humor just does not cut. Monsters have little to do and little time on the screen. I thought it was supposed to be a parody of monster movies? Dark end that may put the viewers angry. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: It's a comedy? If so, why are the really fun pieces so few and far between? The comedies are supposed to roll us on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, because we wanted it to be finished. I can not believe that Anchor Bay has released this tired junk. I admit that this is not one of the worst movies of all time, but it's not worth the time or money of anyone, even if you're a fan of one of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
