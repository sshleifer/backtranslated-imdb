It was a waste of time. Danger: If you look at it, you will be tempted to rip your DVD from the wall and pass it through the window. <br /> <br /> Amateur production: terrible, repetitive and empty dialogue; line of outline as thin as paper; wooden shows; Lucy Lawless had a pathetic speech. <br /> <br /> A seriously wrong story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts of film and film are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The plot "twist"? Extremely simplistic and obvious - like watching a train go down the lane in the middle of the day on the Prairies. This does not even solve correctly. The evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch this, even if it's free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
