I would list this movie as a horror movie. I did it because I did not know a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre is closest to the horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The game was amateurish. You know who the bad guys would be at the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Film students should take this film as an example of what not to do in a movie. It's so bad. Man the bad word is a euphemism. The bad guys hijack a liner and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered to an inhabited Rose Island in the middle of the Pacific. They would be ducks sitting after receiving the money. Is there no escape plan? It's stupid. The cruise director is a former police officer, seal of the navy, kung-fu, I'm scared. The hilarious part is how to defuse the time bomb. He says he knows what he is doing and continues to pull all the threads one by one. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. Is he crazy? Angry, we who watched this idiot. If you have an M-i-L that you do not like. To annoy him, rent this movie and claim that you like it. I assure you that she will certainly tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that his son / daughter has married someone below the norm of his family.
