I'm not so much like Love Sick as I picture. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship of Alex, Kik and Sandu. Their love triangle is full of intensity, frustration and jealousy. Alex finally woke up and realized they would have no results and no future. <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on Sunday October 10 at noon, with us watching the movie together. After the film, he told the audience that the creation of this film, which was meant to express the sexual relations of Romanians, was rather complicated. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, the sex life is always complicated everywhere, I feel no particular impression and effect of the film. The love affairs of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were a kind of neighborhood story. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons I do not like this movie are, first of all, the movie told us how they started falling in love? It seems that after Alex moved into the building where Kiki lived, two girls fell in love. It does not mean anything. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you must imagine and connect these stories by your mind. Secondly, the movie had no scene of sex between Alex and Kik, that's what I expected ????. However, some parties still deserved to be recommended. The "piercing ears" part was quite interesting. Alex was ready to suffer from ear pain to appreciate Kik's love. It was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. In addition, the scene where they were lying on the football field, the conversation expresses that their loves were sincere and passionate.
