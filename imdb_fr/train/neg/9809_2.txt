Some people wonder why there were no more films from Mrs. Murphy after this one. Is it because this film totally blew snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but it would be more adult). The film is too childish, any more than the series of books. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters do not even act like they do in books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He is a girl in the books frigging! Has this been done to make the film attractive to boys? Sheesh. And where was the pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney make a mistake in her job was a mistake. An animated feature, perhaps in the style of Don Bluth's works, would be better suited to a better Murphy film. Overall, I give a 2, because at least Disney made a film of an underrated book series. But, I would like them to do better. Anyway, I always have my books to entertain me.
