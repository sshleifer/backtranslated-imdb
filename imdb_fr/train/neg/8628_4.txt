My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney officials were saying cruelly. That's the problem with "Air Buddies". It's a children's movie strictly by number, filled with carefully calculated kindness, a couple of politically correct mores, and enough humor enough to avoid the dreaded G ranking. As a parent or even 10 years old, you have already seen everything and done everything better before. Think "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you get the general idea. I think a good story for kids is a good story, that's all. "Air Buddies", which is about as original as recycled paper, does not meet this standard. This is not the worst video your child can watch, but there are better megatons.
