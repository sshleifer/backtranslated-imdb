When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a gore movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence cut during the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about its release at the theater). After finishing the movie, I wondered how he could receive a video output. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: A group of three young women on a car trip crush their car in a tree. These women manage to somehow go to a mansion that contains a woman extremely sexist. Beyond this point, the film is mainly composed of useless scenes intended to make it long enough to be broadcast. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting game. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to read her lines on checklists. Others play badly, but not as much as his own. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many photos are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the movie moves on. In addition to all this, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this one. My rating: 1 out of 10
