I wake up suddenly, aware that I'm drooling on the plastic couch, and realize it's a hot Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all the muscle relaxants of my grandmother? Could it be narcolepsy in adults? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped momentarily on Cheap Seats while I was surfing on a channel, and the flagrant lack of humor and talent exhausted my life force with such speed that I fainted . <br /> <br /> shakes her head, gaping, shrugging her shoulders. But I have to give credit to these stupid and boring twins for selling this idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programming manager as me, and when he / she woke up, some horrible episodes were already in the box and he / she hoped that since all the viewers would be asleep, no one now goes to how bad it is and he / she can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
