Swedish action films have evolved in recent years to become something that mimics American action films like "Heat" but with a small budget. This film follows the same prescription as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and hard film. <br /> <br /> The story has already been seen, the dialogue is artificial and the acting is very mediocre, especially on the part of the main actress. . The film tries to paint a picture of hard-core, untroubled military-style burglars and an investigator who has completely lost it with the problems of the past but who, at the same time, acts quite rationally. It does not succeed very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish photo style does not seem fresh and it is not even very successful in this photo. Only a few scenes are really beautiful. In addition, the sound is quite strange and it looks like a lot of dialogues are recorded thereafter. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although it does not paint a convincing portrait of a SWAT team. Chief, has some really funny lines. In addition, the music is pretty good.
