OK, this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the movie they had just gone through an apocalyptic war, but they have money to buy huge robots and oppose them to each other. Instead of investing in the reconstruction of their country, each country prefers to fight with robots that no one can afford. Here is a better idea. Let's trust our most inept resource, the jocks, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director, and about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give credit to this film just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? I really enjoyed this movie, because it was so ridiculous and ridiculous that I had to laugh. In fact, I had a good time watching him, except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin (believe me, no one would see him as an assassin, so it's a surprise, as lame as it is) a jungle jim anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k had not done this one. However, I give two stars because nothing could be as bad as "the hands of fate". <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter either, I saw a lot of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like a cube. The scenario was not even plausible and I saw better play in plays at school. They could have afforded an eleven year old child from any college room. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fun movie to watch.
