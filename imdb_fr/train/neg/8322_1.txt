I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when I checked it on IMDb after seeing it. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It sounds like a good movie at first, but when he was operated on, I could not believe how bad it was. This voice off destroys everything! Just imagine that you're cut like that, and then listen to what he says. I saw the film in German, so I do not really know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yeah, it does not hurt ..."? ... What is it? Tell you "think of something else", then forget your pain while thinking about your girlfriend, it's ... stupid. And her mother ... how on earth did she find anything like this? Someone comes to tell her that her son died from surgery (which she had to expect). In addition, she found letters in the bag of Jessica Albas. in addition to that "she knows the hospital" ... and then it takes him "a second" to understand it? What is hell? ^^ And the end ... why the police tear them off? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. This drunk doctor knows nothing else either ... and then they fuck them all, even the girlfriend ??? Why??? Still, I think Christensen did a bad job, but that does not really matter to me ... it's the mistakes and nonsense I've written about the above. I watched this movie with friends and we were all VERY disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... Do not look at it;)
