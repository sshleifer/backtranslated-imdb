I remember this show. I still remember this fun song, "The Funniest People" of America. Frankly, it should have been called The lame or not funny American people or downright disgusting. Dave could not save this show, neither Bob Saget nor the replacement hosts for AFV who came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes, Dave could make better voice-overs than Bob's. But this series went to hell because of the lame lame videos that people submitted. In addition, it has evolved as a sort of variety show with lame stars, including the Olson Twins. In addition, the AFV was at its peak before they began to take the ugly ugly conqueror as a sinful baby. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the rock theme song!
