First, the video seems to have been shot in the 80's. I was shocked to learn that it was broadcast in 2001. Second, the plot was ubiquitous, from the very beginning story is confusing. If there had been a brief prologue or introduction, the story would have been better. Also I enjoy fantasy but this movie was too much. It was weird and badly filmed. The scenes were not going well and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and it may have been the translation, but it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film, I'd recommend The Promise (visually stunning, intrigue is interesting and good character development) not this movie. Be careful, you will be disappointed.
