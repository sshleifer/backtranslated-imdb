Outer Space's Gayniggers boils down pretty well by name. With a duration of just 27 minutes, he describes a spacecraft of black gay men who come to Earth to free men from women. Even if I see a little importance in the plot, it's also really illogical. Certainly, it's supposed to be a comedy / parody about society and science fiction. I found myself laughing a few times, so it worked out there. <br /> <br /> The special effects are horrible. When the spaceship floats over the Earth, you can see the stars zoom for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning look wrong, the equipment on the boat is illogical, there are several spelling mistakes in the text, the actors are not convincing, the characters are messed up; in general, everything is not taken seriously. If you have gone beyond all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it is very accessible and easy to see until the end. Some parts are hilarious. But overall, the only thing you remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts of all time. <br /> <br /> Seeing that it is a short film and that presents amusing aspects, it is not the worst thing to see. . But it is illogical and has little value in the long run. I can not really recommend it; If you look at it, do it for the unique concept, not for the quality.
