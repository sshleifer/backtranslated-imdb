I will not take too much time here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is great. I have all 3 on DVD, added to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks among the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There are not too many good horror movies, thrillers, drama. A big thank you to the whole team and give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you wonder how I discovered this one on DVD. I bought it via the Internet. This is Region 4, as you know, most US DVD players are from Region 1. If you have a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player as it is a reader all regions. Just go to configure and choose the desired region setting (1-9).
