Do not drink the cool-help. <br /> <br /> This is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary. And to titrate it as a "truth" is shit. The global warming debate is far from over and will not be over until eco-zombies begin to recognize the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a river of information refuting almost every link in the logic chain that Gore sites. The reason why it is so important for people to learn is the disastrous economic impact of climate change prevention measures. Wake people. Anyone with a computer, a little bit of time and a little common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even close to credibility. Do not just read articles that corroborate your opinions, read all that you can find. There is not really an in-depth analysis to do. There are simply too many alternative possibilities and counter-proofs for the theory to reach the most basic level of scientific credibility. In fact, it is so unreliable that it is perhaps the biggest hoax in the course of human existence. It is time for people to start denouncing this kind of propaganda, and it is time to acknowledge to themselves and to others that they can be both advocates for the environment AND recognize the blatant conclusion that hysteria of global warming is a big lie.
