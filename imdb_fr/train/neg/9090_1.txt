A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you wait for an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply an anti-Zionist - nothing wrong with arguing for the destruction of a country, are you?) Or if you support without reservation the Palestinian objectives (for example, the murder of mass, the destruction of Israel), is the documentary for you. Should have an entertaining evening on university campuses in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the number of lies presented in this video. I only hope that those who are really unaware of the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic profligacy.
