Scary, but especially in the sense that it will be finished before my 70th birthday. I saw this as a late night revival around 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but right). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a little scary because he seems to be drunk by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux seems to have smoked all the beautiful city of Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. It's a turkey that should never have been made. If you suffer from insomnia and it is 1:30 am on Saturday morning and there is nothing but reruns of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I guess that surpasses it. But God help you if this is your only choice when it comes to entertainment.
