My God, was it the adaptation of "Persuasion" by "Lola, Run"? It was horrible. Bad enough for the "writer" (and I use the term very vaguely) to cut and stick the dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and precipitates the story: but Anne Elliott rushing a Another place in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the room was an abomination! Austen must turn in his grave. No respectable young woman would have acted so atrociously. And the actress who played Mary? The horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remakes are as bad, they will disable a new generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a flawless version of this wonderful novel (if not), get the 1995 version by Roger Michell with Amanda Root (whose only expressions can say a lot) and Ciaran Hinds. It is superb.
