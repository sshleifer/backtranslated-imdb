Let's say it this way. I actually receive this movie. I understand what the author / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue must be dry and without emotion. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climactic and bland. This was what the screenwriter / director was looking for. A humor / comedy very very very dry. With all this understanding, I still think the movie is nil. It seemed that the author / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie. He had all the same characteristics. Even the main character behaved like Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. His script worked. This film is not. This has no purpose. Well, let me rephrase that. His only goal is to snatch Napolean Dynamite and try to capture his appearance. Too bad it did not work.
