I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, worst-executed and misunderstood movies I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). She starts going out with him while he is tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst thing was that it was not even bad in a good and laughable way. Just terrible - I could not understand why they even bothered to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid - very incredible as an "eccentric" hit man. idk, I could go on - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that makes me look is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it so bad. And the end did not disappoint either by his stupidity! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
