I fully agree with the opinion of Variety's critics that the film is never as funny, lively and insightful about the creative process as its principle suggests. Narratively, it's messy and the lighting is really problematic. While the film is supposed to be character-focused, poor lighting does not improve the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have trouble following spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town Film Festival in the world last year. The comments and reactions to the film range from unassailable and botched to a welcome departure from the movies on our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the new South African wave, but some of the remarkable films about our history of apartheid will indeed rank among our best among our 110 years of history. Unsurprisingly, the film disappeared from Cape Town cinemas just two weeks after its release and from most Durban and Gauteng cinemas. Its appeal is clearly limited among the South African public.
