* can contain some kind of spoiler? * The only mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send geek underwear in a group. His appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly sealed him forever in American consciousness. More recently, he has tried to return to the subconscious of the sect with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a cheap 76-minute dada movie. It sometimes reminded me of genius, whereas on the whole he had almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? is a film where, in one half of the film, all actors are affected by Down's syndrome, which gives it a sensation of madness. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. All this gave the impression of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living and felt simultaneously more successful and failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Half of the actors with Down syndrome also have many snails killed. This is a guy who has snails and who ends up killing one. He is also tormented by a group of people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with 2 girls, one with whom he has sex in a cemetery. He also argues with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover is the director of this show in a strange, semi-interior setting. It's something like controlling the mind of the guy, and the type of cerebral palsy is something like sexuality. Well, at least he masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images made humorous, such as the Nazis Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and the black-faced minstrels saying they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the hangman is still struggling with his love of killing snails and being beaten by other people. They beat him with stones and others. Later, they beat the minstrel after having put him on trial. <br /> <br /> Back inside, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> <What is it? is less logical than Dr. Caligari, and has more than a stolen passbook. The claustrophobic mental space is very similar to the claustrophobia of Dr. Caligari's wallless ensembles. They also had a dialogue that was absolute nonsense. And all that was wrapped in absurd images for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is about 20 minutes left in the film ... maybe a little more ... What is it? lack of images. For the next 56 minutes, we continue to use the same series of images, introducing only new images in the form of an absurd puppet show. The film seems little more than a film that tries to push the limits of the situation in offensive and taboo images. He tries to make fun of himself and baffle the audience. But the problem is that he only has enough different pictures for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse, cinematography, scenography, etc. It was like, "OK, that's the way we can do it and get it off the road." It did not seem interesting to me, and it was rather ... boring. Mr. Caligari, meanwhile, had an amazing cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Note: C
