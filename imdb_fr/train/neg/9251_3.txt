Despite its "independent" status, this film is a stupid Hollywood version of a nauseating relationship between mother and daughter. it was not so bad at first, but somewhere in the movie - about the time the girl goes out with that guy, I think - it turns into a mother-daughter cheese movie. I'm sorry, but I do not know any mother who has this type of relationship with her daughter ... but it's probably better that way.
