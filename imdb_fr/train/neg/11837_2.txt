Can anyone make good CGI movies in addition to Pixar? I mean really, the animation seemed outmoded by the 2006 standards and even the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story really pissed off. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat thrown in the flush. Yeah I know, seems stereotyped. But then, the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to a certain extent. Add a promise of jewels (????) and an evil frog and you will get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something that amused me. Maybe the connection in the movie? Or maybe the rat relationship is happy-ever-after. But nothing has done. He had talent, but he exploded. RE-
