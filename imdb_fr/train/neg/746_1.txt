Save the $ 8.97 you spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and see Steven Spielberg's real movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a filmmaker and, as a big fan of HG Wells, I had to buy this in the hope of sitting and watching three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish looking at this because I could not stay more than 10 minutes to watch. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> It is reported that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell did he go? Did he use the essentials to buy a new house? Finance your retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is really good in this movie. This remains true to the book AND it contains some good performances. I can respect the actors who have obviously tried to make this film a good movie. But the good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible ... and I mean horrible special effects. Any first-year film student could have done a much better job with the CGI. For me, this was mostly like "stop action" cardboard cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project would use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post-production that has been applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1,500.00. In one day, five minutes of scene were better and more realistic than what Hines had created. I have seen movies with budgets under $ 2 million. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than the special effects of Hines in this film. In fact, I have a much better appreciation of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse with the current technology for a movie that looks like a 50s B-Movie, unless it's intended to do so, which should not have been with this particular project. <br /> <br /> A problem I had with DVD transfer was that the movie is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film making. <br /> <br /> Overall, I must say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that offers better cinematography and special effects than this film. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates the quality of making a film or who are fans of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch The Attack of the Woman 50 feet instead. It would be easier for the eyes.
