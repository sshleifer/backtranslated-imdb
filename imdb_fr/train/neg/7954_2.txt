OK this movie was really "unique" we say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented of the film, although she would have had a coke problem during the movie. but she said she could not remember it. well it's his excuse but what is everyone ??? I can not imagine they all had a coca-cola problem. Anyway, it was not that bad, I guess the plot was OK and there were some fun times. although the part where the guy had this thing thrust in his head was a bit too violent for my taste. I guess I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so great and this movie did nothing for her.
