Inspired by Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this bust made by John does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> Although there is no shortage of bloody violence, it lacks narrative sensitivity and "characters". <br /> <br /> "The Incubus" of the title is a demon with a mammoth penis that throws red sperm into the vagina during sex - or, to be more precise, during a rape . <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, who has had a career as a director, is a compelling doctor who challenges the circumstances of the strange attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrendous possibilities of victims resulting in demonic offspring are not considered - is public tolerance for slowly moving waste. <br /> <br /> The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile place illustrates the main issues of this tasteless Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
