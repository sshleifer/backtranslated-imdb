A sequel to (in fact a remake of) Disney's 101 Dalmations live remake in 1996. Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close) is released after being "cured" of her fur obsession by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (yuck!). But the "cure" is shattered when Cruella hears the Big Ben scandal and she once again pursues her mad quest to become the perfect coat of dalmation skin. <br /> <br /> many levels, starting with the fact that it is a movie "Thanksgiving family schlock" designed to suck any penny available from the Disney marketing machine. Close Glenn over over over acts like Cruella. With all she had to endure in this movie - the lame screenplay, the endless makeup, being cooked in a cake at the end - I hope they gave her a very big paycheck. <br /> <br /> (Speaking of which, where in the world will you find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candlelit restaurant located in the same building - like you do it at the peak of this movie?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be dogs. They serve as "Macaulay Culkin's" of this movie, shooting all the stupid gags of "Home Alone" on the bad guys. (Biting them in the crotch, running on their hands with baggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit that dogs were very good actors - well better than humans. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is completely lost in this film as panicked French furrier. The two human "dog lovers" - taken from the previous movie, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they have a dinner in spaghetti in an Italian restaurant, the movie happens between the two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene of "Lady and the Tramp". I thought, "Oh please, do not go!" I was almost expecting humans to satirize on the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen had done in "Hot Shots: Part Two" - doing the "spaghetti kiss", pushing the meatball with his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> And do not get me into the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> The costumes have been nominated for an Oscar and the costumes of the film * are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable.
