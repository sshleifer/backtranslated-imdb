This film is about a group of homosexual black men alien exterminating women on Earth, to create a homosexual universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it intending to see how bad it was. Still, I was shocked to see how serious it was. It was more like a movie made 50 years ago. The game of actors, if any, is ultra bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously wrong, giving the impression that any college film has a huge budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, the jaw dropping as some have already said, but the jaw is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> You have to be seriously intoxicated or have another state of consciousness in order to enjoy this film. If I was from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated that my compatriots produced a film so horribly bad.
