Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are at their best here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I am also a big fan of the TV show. Their music is rock and they are all so talented! I am also a great representative of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE CLUB, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed correctly (I am sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 little S Club fanatics did not laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did it. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat and ugly guy who created a group of mosh" must thank his lucky stars that he left when he did. One of the worst films ever made. Beware of this movie! Do not go there and do not see it! You will not laugh! YOU WILL CRY! 0/10 RJT
