I was at the premiere of this film at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. After the screening, when the screenwriter / director and some of the cast members offered to answer questions, no one even bothered to ask any questions. Rarely has a film been so badly shot (why were random frames extracted from certain scenes?), Misfired (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not cover the entire emotional range of A to B brings a lunch) and totally useless. The characters behave completely out of the character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to an end completely random and useless, supposed to "make you really think". Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I will never come back."
