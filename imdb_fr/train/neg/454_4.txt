Generally overrated movie that has a strong cast and intelligent dialogue and of course Dean Martin's songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher is almost catching up with her reactions to Cage's changing focus and uncontrollable body language. Cage never settles in his role. He tries everything he can think of and appears as an actor rather than a real person and that is what is needed in a love story. Cage had this same type of performance problem in other roles that required a Jimmy Stewart character. Cage continues to play these roles, perhaps because he loves such films, but his own energy as an actor does not lend itself to them, although he has improved with repeated attempts. He should leave this type of role to less interesting actors who would fully engage in the film and spend their energy and considerable talent in more offbeat roles and movies where he could be crazy.
