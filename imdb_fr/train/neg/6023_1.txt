It reminds me when I was a born again believer who was going to be a minister. I had never thought of being a minister or even having my high school diploma, because I was pretty sure I would be kidnapped in heaven before that happened. It was before I discovered that Christianity was hogwash. I am now an atheist, and this just proves that the doctorate "once saved always saved" which Christians tell us is no more real than elves. If it were true, then why did I leave after many years to be a born again believer? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed this stupid prayer of sinners with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their Bible, they would discover that their god thinks that rape, genocide, abortion and many other atrocities agree, he said. They might be surprised to learn that the word "kidnapping" is never mentioned.
