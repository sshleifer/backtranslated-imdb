This film was a yawn of generic titles, it's boring to the point of annoying and the game of actors is wooden and on stilts! Admittedly, it was the director Richard Jobson who made his debut, but who enlightened a scenario as undeveloped as this one? This sounds like another government finance project (the Scottish Screen is credited surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and my opinion will unfortunately be more restrained than this one. Please, Mr. Jobson, what you've done before you make this sedative movie, come back!
