I wanted to love this film, but many things ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens and a hectic editing did not give me the impression of being in the methamphetamine world, but it made me think that I was watching MTV for a few moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere and the acting was really a great example of overexpression. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the underworld, but this movie could not determine if it was a bad horror movie or an even worse comment about the horrors of addiction .
