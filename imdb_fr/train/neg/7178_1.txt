Over-rated and only for people in their twenties who wear thick pink tinted glasses that have never really seen it because they were too young. Horrible animation, dialogue and tired story. Real product of the 80s, the novel is a gimmick TOY (that's it, TOY not the absurd, pretentious and alienating "action figure of collectors"), sold on the back of a bad cartoon and Other accessories, only count for those who bought the toy when they were "real" in the period from "84" to "87". He became cult because of those same adults who are too immature to give up their memories. To avoid.
