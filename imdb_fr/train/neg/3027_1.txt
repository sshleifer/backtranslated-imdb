If it smells of garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. It's by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's mediocre style shames an already uninteresting and slightly false history of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all the action scenes have been linked by bad plots and a horrible acting game. Keira Knightley is totally naked in this one. This is the one and only advantage of this movie. If you want to see her naked, just advance the movie until about an hour and a half and you will catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER! </ 3
