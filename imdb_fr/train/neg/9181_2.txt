I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD !!! It was the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad game, bad effects, bad scenario, all bad! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of adolescent shots heading for a rave (which takes place in broad daylight) on an isolated island. However, when the group arrives, they find only an empty dance floor and clothes stained with blood. Determined to discover what happened to other party animals, the clan goes on a mission in a forest infested with zombies. During this crusade, they are helped by a police chick and a naval captain who have the sufficient number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of misguided action sequences, including a far too long shoot outside the "house of the dead." This fight was complete with Hollywood violence in Hollywood, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sullen camera rotations. One of the characters is even willing to sacrifice himself to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face had been healed by acid, a zombie had spit on him after he continued to hit the creature long after it was deactivated! I'm supposed to have pity on this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To summarize, there is no point in seeing this film if you do not want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of film could easily cover the costs of doing it. Rank: F
