Richard Pryor's early 80's running into the street after a fire must have affected him in one way or another. In his speech, he jokes that it makes you laugh. He seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The toy is the one he chose the most, except I think that you have another. <br /> <br /> A film where a white buys his son a black? A small, inaccurate political mistake underlying you was such a thing. It's to see Richard become all sentimental, which finally made me come out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor take revenge on this brat. On the contrary, it becomes the misunderstood nausea of ​​children! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or one of his 70's movies. It's a waste of time for any movie watcher!
