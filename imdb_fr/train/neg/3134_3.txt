"The dead" fall into the category "loss of life" (WOL). I am sad that I am now two hours more was not entertained. Other members of my family also watched this film and made humiliating comments on screen and rooted for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I read other negative reviews and I can not add anything else to this movie as this one could be reduced to 25 minutes, which could take 30 minutes on TV without any loss of land. It reminds me of a dish that contains many good ingredients, but when it is served, it is bland and tasteless. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy should have done 8 to 10 feet and improved the plot by eliminating the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to denigrate the facts and want DNA samples for the wrong reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown in their ears by their colleges. Later, after all was messed up by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove that everyone was wrong.
