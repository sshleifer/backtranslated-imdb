I watch A LOT of bad movies, MUCH !!!!!! It's a bit of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday night, a group of friends and I gather to watch garbage from around the world - NOTHING. ..? Turkish superhero movies, Brazilian vampire movies, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner, ANYTHING movies (except perhaps Raising Helen) but I've never seen a worse film than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even entertaining on the part of Ed Wood - it sucks. Now, this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was shot because Whoopi took off his gloves and clearly explained to the press and whoever would like to hear that she hated THIS PIECE OF CRAP = she had tried to to evade his contract. moaned, she moaned but nevertheless they pour her big butt in this futuristic policeman uniform tight skin skin that is awful to see, yuck !! And you can just watch her bubble up during the shots - do it all but look out of the camera at her agent so she can shout at her. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible that a third grade class could do a better job if the cookies promised.
