I only have one thing left to say about this film: the scene where Shaq is in a musical issue with the character of Francis Capra and who wants to be genius. never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting is terrible (come on, it's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (just as horrible) twice before watching this movie.
