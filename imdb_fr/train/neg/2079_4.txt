I am a big fan of Ivan Reitman. I liked Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer, you already know that the character of Uma will be dropped by that of Luke. So the accumulation is clearly directed towards the moment when it unleashes its super-powers on it. But the profit is simply not there. The shark throw managed to get a (slight) laugh but again, everything was in the caravan. <br /> <br /> Nobody stays breathless like Uma and Luke is on Owen's diet on his good days.If you do not sit down for Riann Wilson with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cling. It's a comedy, is not it? <br /> <br /> It's not awful, it's like a cracker behind the fridge. The sending of movies of superheroes and feminism could have been so brilliant, but it failed on both counts. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the last name.
