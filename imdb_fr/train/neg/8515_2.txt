I was so disappointed by this show. After hearing and reading all the reviews, how it was a "revolutionary show" and all kinds of uncontrollable promises of quality, I tried to look at it. The game was forced and exaggerated. The story had very little meaning. As for the suspicion of "watching in the life of teenagers" so much vaunted, I could see that a derisory attempt that had as much reality as a reality show. Some wonder why there are negative comments on this show. The reason is that it's really not so good and beating the drums on the quality of this show only serves to draw attention to its poor quality.
