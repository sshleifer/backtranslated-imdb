This thing is horrible. The character of Ben Affleck is egocentric and sadistic, a sadistic fratboy fist-in-the-nose. And he is the romantic hero! His character as a draftsman does not change from beginning to end, but his money finally allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were socialist, I would have an incredible vision, but I'm not socialist. We, capitalists, love the magic of Christmas from time to time. It's not magic. I do not know what it is. It's just horrible. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara makes me laugh hysterically since the late 70's. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underutilized. If Ben was out of the equation, these people might have imagined something excellent.
