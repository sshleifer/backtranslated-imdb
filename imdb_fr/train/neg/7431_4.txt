CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is becoming increasingly clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING dating from the mid to late 1960s <br /> In itself , MATRON is not bad, it's just that we've already seen all this with a thin plot (a handful of spies trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills they're considering to sell to third world countries) a slightly amusing yet unsophisticated nature. I think that's where the problem lies - gags do not have fun with the unsophisticated nature that's starting to show its age. Did we need another movie using a man disguised as a woman to drive the plot? The worst criticism I can make is perhaps seeing CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a hard time trying to remember a very funny phrase. This is a serious problem for a comedy
