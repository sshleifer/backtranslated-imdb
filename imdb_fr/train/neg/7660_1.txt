0 * Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the video game developer, Uwe Boll tries to recreate the game in an action-packed attack game. Unfortunately, he does not succeed. Instead, it's one of the worst movies ever made! Even if he receives minor celebrities such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the basics needed for a film to be good, like a screenplay, and a certain basic relativity of what is happening in the world. darkness and light. The film bounces everywhere and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make the monsters. Even though they looked cool and the food was good, a little lame. Honestly, it's one of the worst movies ever made. My final grade 0/10.
