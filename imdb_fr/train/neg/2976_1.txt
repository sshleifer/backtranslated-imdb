Miraculously, it's actually pretty observable. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad, it's so ruinous, my life is bad, it's so bad, it's pretty bad. Well, it's quite laudatory. The production values ​​are rotten in all areas, the acting is unbearable and Romero-wannabe satire can not decide which side of the ecological barrier it makes fun. The internal logic takes second place and propels itself out of the refrigerators, the incubation times of the viruses vary according to the plot, the balls work against the zombies or not, the zombies have the power to speak or not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the frame is so great that it's boring. The dialogue seems to have been translated by the same computers as those used in the instruction manuals, and the extent of the zombie infestation does not imply any ingenuity of Romero's films. All this is crowned by a dreadful synth note. Absolute waste.
