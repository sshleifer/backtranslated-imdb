Before I begin, let me say that my experience with this film may have been influenced by dubbing, which, according to other comments, was the original which is considered inferior by some. It is therefore quite possible that the subtitles or the apparently new DVD version make a difference. I have not read the corresponding book either; I only know another Japanese manga and the cultural context may be missing. <br /> <br /> Other potential spoilers are waiting for us. <br /> <br /> I usually like science fiction stories tinged with dark color. Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not like this movie at all. Although it started a little intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was half finished. There are all kinds of problems. Let's start with what is probably the most serious: dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they do not claim a name for the nth time, they are generally grumbling monosyllables ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Hein?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. This does not help that many of them get a few minutes on the screen with nothing interesting to say that would distance them from the stereotypes suggested by the visual elements. <br /> <br /> augmented by a random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that seems vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing profound and meaningful here - it seems random, thrown together at random from various pieces of classic science fiction ideas without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The plot is hardly doubtful. nothing more than an excuse to start the overly long final sequence of escalating scenes of chaos and destruction. This does not mean that there is of course a problem of destruction and destruction. but in this case, you will ask yourself "what is the purpose of all this and how long before it is finished". The development of the character in the last 30 minutes was little more than Tetsuo to turn into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The end resembles that of 2001 - a series of weird images that solve or explain anything, give the viewer the feeling that he is interested in a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some people claim that this kind of thing is art; but for me it was a lot, of course, of imaginative use of colors and shapes. (Part of the music was also very interesting). Unfortunately, everything is style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Do you want to watch animated films that cleverly deal with "adult" themes? I am sad to say that you are more likely to find that kind of thing at "South Park".
