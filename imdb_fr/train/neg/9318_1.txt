It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Again, I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back seemed cool and the cover was very pretty too (after buying this and the movie "Malevolence" that I commented here, I learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods, in the desert or on a farm. It would have been in the woods of Texas, but probably would have been shot in the director's yard. The production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the worst. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover was saying. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another store that bought used DVDs, but none would buy it. It's really awful this poor, miserable excuse for a movie. I have seen bad movies before (Troll 2 for example), but it definitely takes the cake. I did not think there was a movie worse than "Troll 2". Boy I was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free, but even if you're stuck with it, unless you throw it away, what am I going to do !!!
