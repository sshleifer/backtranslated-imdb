I do not know who writes these critical reviews for this film, but believe me, STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and slasher movies and this one is LAME, it only lasts about 80 minutes long and believe me, that's all I could handle. The plot is terrible, play is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's films are better than that. RUN AWAY from JIGSAW. I was expecting to hate the acting, which can be forgiven directly in the video, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> That was not afraid, very little Gore, <br /> and really unattractive distribution. <br /> <br /> I watched this video with three other friends <br /> <br /> who, I hope, keep talking to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to throw the disc out the window. I can not believe anyone can have <br /> <br /> given this tripe a good review.
