It was really a film of the time - very long sequences without dialogue, bad flashback and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only in the romantic interest of men. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is captivating every time he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time scrutinizing the shrubs. Alastair Sims is always a pleasure to see, but he too is terribly underused. <br /> <br /> The film has another positive aspect, in that it describes many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (like the appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people still do not know. Too many of today's World War II films portray the Allies as a whole good and the Axis as evil, when history tells us that people are much more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie for when you recover from the flu and you are wrapped in the couch without being able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes are stabilizing, this is the movie for you.
