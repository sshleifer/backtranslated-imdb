TYSON <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Reverent - but scrupulously fair - story of the life and times of the champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction for rape, the film makes sure not to portray him as a hero or a villain, but paints a realistic portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success and the people who have forged his fate forever . or bad. Limited by the time allotted, the scenario gallops into a succession of relevant details, briefly describing important events, culminating in Tyson's (temporary) downfall in 1995. The novices will be enlightened by the timeline, while the rights of the Boxing directors will be entertained eventually by director Uli Edel's close approach to the subject. He describes Tyson's life as a circus in which he was eventually misled by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the scenario reserves most of his venom to Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, characterizing her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of her naivety. The production values ​​are uniformly solid and the distribution is superb: Michael Jai White faithfully imitates the main character; George C. Scott plays Cus D'Amato, Tyson's mentor, amidst acres of clenched teeth. and Paul Winfield is surely born to play Don King!
