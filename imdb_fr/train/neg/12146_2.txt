This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be vicious and shocking; but FOOD MASSES deflates while some stiff-legged zombies roam the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie outbreak known as the Lazarus virus is downplayed by newspapers and government-manipulated TV channels. A brave but stupid couple of Channel 5 TV News believes that its audience is given false hopes and has no idea of ​​the real danger they face. An enthusiastic journalist (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), aided by a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk life to life to present a "live" show showing the fate that awaits them. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This thing is obviously very small budget and gives the impression of a high school game that went wrong. Playing is atrocious and hungry zombies are almost comical. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FEEDING THE MASSES should be left to starve.
