Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her deceased mother a lot and regularly visits her grave (located in a graveyard just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> > This starts well with a really strange sequence in the graveyard ... then falls apart. The story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the movie 85 minutes. The acting is terrible in all areas (Cole being easily the worst). Badly edited with some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes (and the sound) are simply cut without rhymes or reasons. The film also has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> Regarding blood and violence, forget about it! There is very little and what is incredibly wrong. I have never seen blood so fake - it looks like ketchup! Boring, useless - a film drive-in legitimately forgotten. You can skip this one.
