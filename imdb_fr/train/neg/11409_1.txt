Truly launched the disgusting violence trend of the 80s, posing as a "horror film". I was the target audience of this repulsive trash and I was disgusted at the time. <br /> <br /> Oh, where to start? Let's see the editing: You can bring people back to life if they died a violent death. So this ridiculously weak premise is the excuse to slaughter people horribly, because, well, you have to bring it back to life! It might have worked if it had been played over black laughs at the Re-Animator or something like that. But no, it's played directly. There is a whole terrified family in a car that is tracked down, one of the few scenes at least where their disappearance is off the screen. However, just about everything else is on the screen. There is actually a scene where a girl who walks around is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople, who are all filming and smiling with several cameras. Then, there is a close-up on his face while the filmmakers reveal lovingly - and a lot of time - in an accelerated photograph, his beaten face being reduced to nothing and redefined to become "normal" again. This was done, of course, by Jack Albertson, a funeral engineer, behind the whole thing. He likes to drive in an ambulance / hearse playing Tommy Dorcey's old tunes, I guess it's supposed to be cute. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the sheriff is undead and the doctor kindly offers to repair his rotting hands. It is not clear why the sheriff did not go out with the other inhabitants of the city, killing children with joy, cutting his face, sticking needles in the eyes of the burned, etc. <br /> <br /> I really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it a rating. It's not scary, the twists are laughable and, overall, it's a little sick. It's not even good enough to "see the challenge" or enjoy it to such a level that you could watch a bad HG Lewis movie. It's just a horrible junk, made for people who are having fun in this kind of useless gore, and made by people who pamper for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Albertson was involved.
