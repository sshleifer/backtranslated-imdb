Sorry, but I'm going to ruin both the plot and the end for you in the hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one I am now facing. The father dies and the mother asks in a letter to Santa to bring him back to the family for Christmas ... and Santa does it. Dad is Peachy, happy in good health and totally unaware that he's dead. Everything ends sweet. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently saw my five year old son lose his best friend, it was a horror movie. Now, my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring back his friend is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will of a young heart. No persuasive force will convince him that it was just a movie and that his dog would not come back at Christmas. It was heartbreaking to see his joy only to know that on Christmas Eve he will face a new loss. <br /> <br /> Shame on you on behalf of all believers who have recently lost a loved one. It's hard enough to manage the loss once for a child, but some wishes should not even be described as a possibility.
