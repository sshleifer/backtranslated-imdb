Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst filmmakers. I swear he has no real knowledge of filmmaking. he made a brilliant film and it's a scary movie. Scary Movie 2 was good too, but all that Keenan did was a disaster. avoid such titles as do not be a threat to the center-south while drinking your juice in the hood ..... I know, what title! obviously this film too, everything that has a name of Keenans in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half stupid stupid things that never made me laugh. Believe me, women may like this movie a bit because of some things that are happening, but overall, this movie will never be loved by those who have a good taste in movies ..... ... 1/10 ....... jd Seaton
