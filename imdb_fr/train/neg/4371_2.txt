After leaving the popular "The Andy Griffith Show" of television, Don Knotts offered the famous film a daring attempt with a series of crazy but comical vehicles. Unfortunately, "The reluctant astronaut", filmed cheaply (like most of Knotts' films), is much worse than his others. Don plays a schnook in a small town that is accepted at the astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for a space trip - they want him as a new guardian! Some might say that weak satire takes advantage of the recent American fever for the new age of technology, but the film is actually a weak excuse for taking care of worried kids. It starts well, with proper setup and nostalgic locations, but it becomes more and more devoid of wit and silly. * from ****
