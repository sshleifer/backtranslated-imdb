This comedy is really not funny. It's a romance that plays so much on stereotypes that it has no impact. It's a caper movie so derivative - yes, even back then - it does not break. <br /> <br /> The casting is adequate. More than that, it's hard to say. However, what is good is that the players are not familiar. At the MGM, it would have played Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who did not have the time to work, but who could have been a lot of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known film is peopled with almost unknown performers today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. Yet this does not give any real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic imitation. And who wants that?
