The film is very long and unfortunately very different from the novel. If you want to see the movie, do not read the novel first, it would shock you. However, cinematography was correct and if you are a person who likes adventure genres that explore Africa, go for it. Actor's performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother, rather than a lady looking for his father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave while here she turned out to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
