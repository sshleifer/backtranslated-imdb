This film is terribly slow and has no plot. It traces the life of a group of dismissed workers. One of the oldest is sincere in his attempt to find a job. There may be a social comment here, but, it is confusing, no one is painted very nicely. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why he had a 7.8 when I decided to watch him. I watched all this tedious thing and built expectations for a huge gain. No chance. The IMDb rating has always been a good match for my tastes. Anything above 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie. This is not my genre, so my agreement does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give him a 1.
