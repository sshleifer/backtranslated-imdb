When exactly is a good movie going bad? When does a movie go from "observable" to "where is this switch & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF"? Fortunately, DVDs like this one can be borrowed from the library - for free! Likewise, thank god for the "fast forward" switch of the DVD player. I'm sorry for the people who were fooled at the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot exactly when, because now everything is out of focus), our "hero", Luke Wilson starts running transit traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. That's when I gave up, realizing that I could not care if he found his ride or was overturned by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting, it's when Luke Wilson climbs out of the garbage can, hair dryer in hand, and meets first "the heroine", Uma Thurman. The scene ended with the criminal snatching the purse, helplessly suspended in front of the emergency escape, far above the departures of Luke and Uma. It was the last time the movie was funny, and when was this scene? Ten minutes after the beginning of the film? <br /> <br /> Whenever the movie was trying to become "funny", it could not. Whenever the movie tackled "excitement," it collapsed, going in the opposite direction. When a score could have helped the life out of the hogweed, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were not necessary and were beyond the lame; damage to sets and accessories is unnecessary and childish. When Uma turns into a crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "The 40-year-old virgin meets pulp fiction"; that's when I realized there was no way to turn around because I really liked The 40 Years Old Virgin and Pulp Fiction. Mimzy ") adds nothing to the insult to injury in this horrible movie Rainn Wilson, the TV King, should stay with this equally terrible medium Hey, Rainn Wilson, let the full motion pictures! Uma's rival, Anna Faris, was coming on the screen, I was expecting Jason or Freddy, or a terrifying monster, to jump from behind the scene, once you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie", that's all you see, no matter the movie, no matter what medium, the character played by Wanda Sykes was simply awful and misplaced in this movie.
