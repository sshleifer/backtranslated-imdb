Men, do I like police movies full of action, filming, lawsuits, etc.? <br /> <br /> My boy, I was disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfactory film. We have already seen all this before, the hostages, the bank, the surroundings ... Yet two bad guys who kill several officers and innocents who just stay in the line of fire - without being touched because of the Kevlar. <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Back to the bank, where the stupid hostages did not lock the safe or the doors when the bad guys came out. What stupidity did the director think we would be. <br /> <br /> Okay, the clich√©s between this fake documentary were good, but after watching the movie, I only wondered: why the police a decent shooting course? And why there were so many cops and SWATs during a very long break. Really bad.
