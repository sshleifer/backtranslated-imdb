Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most open viewers (most!) ... Movies are my passion and I am a regular at my local cult movie location. ..I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever I get there, and that I never seem to be able to leave the place without having a thorough discussion or exchange of ideas. ideas about what's happening inside the cult movie region ... I like to rent strange things, and that's precisely why this movie was recommended by one of the guys from the cult movie place. He told me he thought I had to see that. and since the cover said it was a movie with a Jodorowsky atmosphere (one of my favorites!), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not really fair, because I do not have it I think it was awful, I did not know how to evaluate it differently. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made me sick: I felt physically sick! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally turned? I still did not want to turn it off, or maybe I just could not because I was so wickedly fascinated ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not horrible, a 1 as I said.Just not my cup of tea (or wodka for that matter) ...
