SEX WISH was released at the beginning of the video boom (less than ten minutes longer, ahem, UK) in the UK. He caused a tabloid storm in a cup of tea while he would have inspired an imitating murderer. Strangely, the newspapers swept this extremely disturbing movie under the rug by rushing to box the relatively harmless films of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON. The film has been virtually forgotten. I jumped at the opportunity to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with the jaw on the ground. It's not so much politically incorrect as completely crazy, Michael Winner's triple-X on DEATH WISH (does the title inspire the game?) With hardcore sex and really nasty violence thrown into a bubbling beer of the seventies sleaze. If you do not consider yourself impertinent, this may require you to think again. At the end of SEX WISH, you'll want to clean your eyes with a disinfectant and take a long, hot shower to purge yourself. If a film really deserves the slogan "it's only a movie, just a movie, just a movie", it's this one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates in front of her, the flying mustache of Harry Reems, the helpless young black couple who is forced to fuck in front of the sword cane killer (they would have won Oscars for their entirely believable performances if the Academy had gone mad) before the man is castrated for his troubles, and some discordant directives that threaten to lift the debates over from their obvious origins of Grind House. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought that the world was more innocent thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you completely wrong.
