I only rented it because I loved the first movie. However, call it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a scam for you to rent. He is actually an executive producer and clearly has nothing to do with the making of this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> A tragic scenario, terrific special effects and Jon Bon Jovi, the hunter of vampire the least convincing of all time. It's not even comically bad. <br /> <br /> We end up with a dull and uninteresting film with a terrible scenario and an unshakeable staging. It stinks of a small budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like bubonic plague.
