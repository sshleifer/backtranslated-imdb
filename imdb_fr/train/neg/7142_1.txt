This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I was waiting for a cheesy movie, but at least some scenes / cool car races. What I got was nothing. The races have a budget so low that they have accelerated to give the impression that the cars "go fast". In one scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from more than 200 to 0 in about 4 seconds while circling. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, watch the series fast and furious. They may be a little tacky, but 100 times better than this movie could hope. Better yet, just look at Mischief 3000, the best automotive film ever, I think.
