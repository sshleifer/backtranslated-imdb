Seriously. I just finished my first visit of Demonicus and I miss the words. <br /> <br /> I remember when I saw the name of Charles Band on a film and where my heart was pounding. It was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they were still more agitated than most of the trendy hawkers we had to endure otherwise. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious double trail for the "Alps" and an abandoned railway tunnel is actually supposed to be "an old cave". I mean, they did not even try to dress it up with foam or film it in a way that might suggest it was something other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! As the cover suggests, instead of a scary demonic gladiator, we get a guy wearing Wal-Mart's latest Halloween outfit. There's a rather cool-looking corpse that comes to life sometimes to vomit and stir your fingers, but it does not even learn to stand before the last five minutes. Why could not he be the bad guy? Instead, we have Joe Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such guts. I like movies that are so bad, they are good. Hell, I enjoy from time to time a film so bad, it's just bad. This one, however, is simply unassailable. A perfect example of making money rather than making a quality movie.
