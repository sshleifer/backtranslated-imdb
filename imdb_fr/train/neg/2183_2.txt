This movie was really bad, whether you consider it a sci-fi movie, a horror movie or even a comedy. Everything is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and is) really cheap, the actors have no idea what an acting game is and the script clearly shows that it was shot at the same time. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all - she was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; they failed here too (the makeup is awful even for the late 50s, rather funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the career of director Joseph Green as such and also as a writer has never materialized; he was really bad at the same time. The same goes for the actors who lead and support. <br /> <br /> The best achievement of "The brain that would not die" is its short duration.
