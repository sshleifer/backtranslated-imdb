This film is obsolete and misses the target. He is far from the 89 Batman he is trying to do. That the singer whatever her name can not act, and we see why her film holder is dead. Notice how this movie died at the box office, no one sees it on television either. My uncle and my father were waiting for Batman, and the film's impression is more like Cop Rock. No need to rent 3/10
