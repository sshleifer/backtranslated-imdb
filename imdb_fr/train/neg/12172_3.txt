After the debacle of the first Sleepaway camp, which thought that a franchise could be born. SC II has a superior appearance. Murder more inspired and much more fun. That may not say much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth renting. <br /> <br /> To: Receive, do not take yourself too seriously, just like SC I. Inspired Killings. Disadvantages: the action game and the mules are legion. <br /> <br /> Result: 5/10 <br /> <br />
