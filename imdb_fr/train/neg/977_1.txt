"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that the American public and movie critics are so numb and lobotomized by the feces that Hollywood produces that they praise the skies even a mediocre film with barely laughing? This is the only reason why I can understand why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use this term vaguely because there is nothing fun in this movie) arouses good reviews. <br /> <br /> I listened to this dazed film as the scriptwriter Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel even thought for a moment that their screenplay was funny. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into film. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for a movie in 2000, writers DV DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg were not wrong because they have kept the essence of Hornby's spirit and humor. They made one of this year's best movies. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so bad? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we could love, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel excised all that is funny in Hornby's work. In Americanizing the story, they slaughtered it, removing everything that was good and unique from Hornby's work and replacing it with a classic spirit. <br /> <br /> They turned a funny story into a fictional romantic comedy, never once turning from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each with a different function. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious and the third is romantic. You want to guess the number of male friends that Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" such a pleasure, it was not only a good man and a woman of mark, but also attractive characters of support. In this "Fever Pitch", the six friends do not make or say anything particularly funny. They are so insignificant that they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the film is because the formula requires it. Poor Ione Skye ends up being one of Lindsey's girlfriends in a thankless role. The beautiful Skye was to wish Lloyd Dobler to come and pick her up and take her away. When you think about it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to focus on such a tedious scenario. <br /> <br /> There is no single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unconstrained. Each plot is predictable, each joke telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel work for laughs. The first 45 minutes are so slow that you wonder if these guys realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot turns in this movie with your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel have written this with a guru's formula of screen writing glued to the wall. When they came to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says it must be happening now." And hop! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the film. They have no idea how to present their story and their characters (they tell the story of V.O. not to the protagonist, but to another guy sitting behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to extremely clumsy writings, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble over their odd initial encounters. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is cute and adorable better than anyone. She is as talented as Goldie Hawn in her golden age. But even his kindness can not save this extraordinarily terrible movie. She tries to draw some energy and humor from this story. About 30 minutes into the movie, Lindsey tells Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for his remark is that it was in the script. For Fallon, Ben never says anything, even from a distance. Fallon is neither spiritual nor funny; when he does comedy, he exaggerates. <br /> <br /> Fallon has never been better than Saturday Night Live. He was perhaps the least funny person of this show. Do you remember that lame sketch on a radio DJ that made all the voices? The only reason Weekend Update has worked occasionally is because Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows comedy well. <br /> <br /> Actors who think themselves funny and behave in this way rarely, if ever, are really funny. This is true of Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he hardly lifts a laugh. His shtick stuttering and unsure of himself did not work on the small screen; it's uglier on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this picture also requires some dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a charge of its dramatic content. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a dramatic talent, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even go from A to B. Ben has no personality or depth. Often, he presents himself as crazy. And not a nice person to that. It's beyond the spirit of what Lindsey would find attractive to him. Compare the performance of Fallon to that of Firth in the British version and you will understand how Ben, de Fallon, is terribly flat, not funny and forced, and how wrong he is in this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" gives a glimpse of Ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comedic nuance! <br /> <br /> Like "High Fidelity", an Americanized "Fever Pitch" could have worked brilliantly. He needed just better writers, more capable filmmakers, and, most certainly, a stronger, smarter, smarter man. Do yourself a great favor: Avoid this rotten movie; rent the 1997 UK version and read Hornby's book instead.
