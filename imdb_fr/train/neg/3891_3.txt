I think that my favorite part of this film, the one that illustrates the sheer uselessness, stupidity and inanity of the proceedings, comes at the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the Sheriff, finally cornered the Melting Man on a landing on the stairs of a power station. Remember, Nelson has been looking for the MM for most of the movie and the MM has killed and eaten a lot of people at that time (including his boss), and Nelson is well aware that MM is madly insane and hungry. human. flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is pointing his gun at MM, which is, and I'm giving the movie and Rick Baker the accessories that come with it, the most disgusting and terrifying thing we've ever seen . seen. And he shouts to DOCTOR TED NELSON a very important question: "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera goes to DOCTOR TED NELSON and it's obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so focused on the problem of FINDING the Faded Man, that he had never thought about carrying restraints, a lasso, a straitjacket, a net, tranquilizing darts, or maybe a New Age band of Vangelis to appease the wild beast. <br /> <br /> Then the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melting Man goes crazy, and hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> Maybe that explains why NASA is racing with the space shuttle program in the sub-lunar space for 30 years instead of returning to the Moon or Mars as everyone knows how to do it. I do not know. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's the kind of ugly and lazy writing and direction that understates every aspect of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors are, because the movie completely despises their characters. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also illustrate the stupidity of the scene: There is a scene starring the rude old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn by the melting man. This scene is a nadir in the cinema of the 70s. I can guarantee you that you have never seen such a useless and irritating setup of strange people in your life. And the assault of the Melting Man on the lady who lives in the house where a horse is peeing on the walls defies any attempt to transform it. (BTW, I think famous director Jonathon Demme has a role to play in this redneck husband scene that goes first to check the house and never goes out again). The only thing that prevents the actress from literally chewing the scene is that, as I said, their horse apparently pee on it. And we have to watch his nerves for at least two minutes longer than any SANE filmmaker would. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should defeat the crap of the IMM director and photographer. I remember him from an old episode of Columbo where he looked MUCH better than his. The idea of ​​a leading man, nobody would have, but strong and discreet. But no one could be as unattractive in real life as his manager makes him look here. <br /> <br /> All the others are doing a little better, except the old couple (and shut up, I know they were played to laugh, but I do not laugh!), but not a lot. <br /> <br /> This definitely falls into the category of "movie disasters". Still, I would watch it again before looking at many other abortions of the '70s and' 80s ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night" come to mind), and the MST cover is very entertaining, so if you have the opportunity, look at the MST version.
