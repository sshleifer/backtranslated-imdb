SOME SPOILERS THAT ARE NOT ARABLE <br /> <br /> Why do people, when disoriented, sick or frightened in a club, make their way through the crowded dance floor to get to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in his mind would he hide under a bed if someone entered their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger's door and when he or she does not answer IMMEDIATELY, open the door, enter, shout some good evening and then start to examine their documents? <br /> <br /> If you were chased by someone you just discovered to be a murderer, what would you do? Sneaking and hiding under a wooden platform or among metal tools? Do you run quietly to an old barn or other decrepit structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost all the thrillers of recent years, but since it's the "The Return" page, I'm obviously talking about "The Return". I saw it for free because I work in a movie theater and I try to screen all the "scary" movies. I thought it was tolerable ... apart from the clich√©s worn. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really dull and looks a bit like "huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the plot are revealed as the film progresses and it is almost enough to make it interesting, except that the explanations provided were not enough and that I was almost lost until last third of it. <BR /> <br /> If you're a hardcore thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie, I guess it's worth a morning ticket. If you thought the trailer looked like an interesting movie and you could not wait ... wait.
