If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you get a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it child (in EM Freeman's Campfire Chillers) and I was so excited to see it. a movie based on that goes out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) nuances in the movie that had no place in the movie. When the book was written, PC did not even exist. <br /> <br /> I suggest you do not waste your time or money! If you see it on the video store shelf, LEAVE IT.
