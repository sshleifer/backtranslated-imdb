Another pity that the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise, it would give an easy zero. Really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact, the name of Peckenpah did not appear on what I would have never guessed he had done. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco I know was often on the set and said it was almost sunrise, he said that Sam was just snubbed. It's shoveled. The laughing part at the beginning of the movie is the ONLY thing in this mess that deserves a second look. Even Gig Young is not watchable. It's a real test of masochism. If I had been forced to see him in a theater, I would have jumped on it screaming. And now, I feel really guilty of having seen everything from a very comfortable sofa and too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than caught up as and when. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob spelled backwards. Yuck !!!!!
