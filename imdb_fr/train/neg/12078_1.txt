I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. True, it's Shakespeare and it takes a certain state of mind to be interested or not. But this film exceeds all the barriers of long monologues and others, which could prevent many from not worrying about a story based on Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this production is the total flatness of the characters. Often, when interacting between characters, it's almost hard to tell which lines are who. Certainly, I think this film is dubbed in English. Certainly, they could have obtained actors who could have added a little more drama to these classic literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this film more than 1, although it may be based on prejudice perhaps of age and what would seem a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
