In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love again with a much younger woman. He meets her in his restaurant. The young woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks him out. His reaction to his invitation is rather strange. It was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> And that annoys me about all this movie. It was not so funny. The jokes and the script was terrible! The only jokes I liked were the teeth of a waiter, but after many times, even that started to get bored. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a girlfriend called sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with the spirit of an old woman! It was scary! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this man has adult conversations with that child. It made no sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do it. So even the conversation at the end, when they are sitting around the table, even if it was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I only like movies that are really funny. I guess I will never watch this movie again.
