What was it ?? Pre-destination, you can not change the future because it has already been written. <br /> <br /> I'll give you that a lot. I wanted to see what was happening next, so I watched the whole movie. This film took a concept and made it visible. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a recommendation, see it at the price of a morning. No thrills but an interesting concept. They should have left aside the reference to the year 2000 ....
