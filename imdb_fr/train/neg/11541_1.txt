This film is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is amazing to see how many brilliant actors, such as two main characters in this film, have agreed to act in such a worthless peace. The film is a kind of rape / beat and revenge. A couple went to party and on the way home, they hit a deer and he came out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys arrives. He did not go to their car, he was beaten and beaten as she tried to run the engine of the car that betrayed her and she was raped by a gang. Then she is in her father's house and one of the villains is her neighbor so she took a shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario! Below Hollywood! He was against this vengeance but "she is raped" "they make fun of her" so she must kill them all ... But once inside the house, she was satisfied by pushing the top of the rifle into the anus of the wicked and went away when he had gone mad and executed the wicked. Personally, I think that the director is short of money before finishing this film, because the film ends before executing another person involved in this gang rape and flogging, which is not a big surprise, because the sponsor has seen it and wants to get his money back. LoL This film is not even intended for those who like to watch a rape because they will not see anything that they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is to annoy that this peace of trash was made by British cinematography which Personally, I like and that is the reason why I watched that. Do not do it yourself, you have better things to do than watch a stupid scenario movie ...
