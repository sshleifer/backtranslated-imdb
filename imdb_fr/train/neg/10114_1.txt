It's one of the worst movies of all time. I like cheese movies but it's just awful. Where are the images of the film that are on the box? I think more money has been spent on DVD box illustrations than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why does a company publish a DVD whose cover is so misleading? I feel like an idiot to rent this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I'm exploring IMDb, I should have done a little research and list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and my time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, stick umbrellas and cocktails in your eyes. It will be much more pleasant. You were warned!
