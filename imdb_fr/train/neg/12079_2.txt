Poor Will would turn in his grave if he could afford this horrid adaptation of his classic game by German television. It is obvious that very little money has been spent on this. A stage column, a bridge and random columns are considered as a set. The film was dubbed unnecessarily in English, the English actors sometimes doubling their lines. All the production had an incredibly dark and dreary feeling. And where was Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gave this desolate production the treatment it deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this film was never in first place.
