May I say first of all, that I was so attached to this movie that I signed up for IMDb specifically to review it. And my criticism? It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The synopsis of the film seemed interesting - Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the film plot failed to gather all these elements. Do you remember the episode of South Park that featured Manatees writing Family Guy using "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write Unholy? It's as if the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to relate them and then, to make things even less sensible, he included a Donnie time travel theme. Darko-Esquire until the end, disturbing the timeline. . <br /> <br /> I could tell from the beginning that it was a bad movie. The special effects were too little budget for anything better than going straight to the DVD. The acting was not great, but in all fairness I saw worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher was just comical. <br /> <br /> I have no vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this film can not be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, it would have been a good movie. But he was overexcited. Waaaaay over hyped.
