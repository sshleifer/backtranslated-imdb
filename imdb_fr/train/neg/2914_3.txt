The title above is used to present the movie "Gen" to its audience. Gen talks about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with his departure from his mother to start his new job. While driving, we realize that she is not so close to home that the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she enters the garden of the hospital, she sees the body of a patient dying. It's the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers go to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all the roads are cut off because of bad weather conditions. All their communications with the outside world are also cut off. There is no way out !! In these few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now, everyone suspects. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary. There are of course some positive aspects of the film. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she goes to the hospital and her first moments at the hospital. The game is good. Some of them, however, try too much to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock should have spread in the movie. What I'm saying is that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it as a travesty at the end, we should have realized that this was happening when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it, which I think did not work well. In addition, the film's most dangerous patient is expected to be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fits someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently discovered that he was only 21 years old. It made me more positive about him and his future films. I will not note this film * on ***** though.
