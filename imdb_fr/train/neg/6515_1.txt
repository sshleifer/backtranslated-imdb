This is not a boring film, the audience can stay in their chair, fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, filmmaker and actor here. The story is simple: after a divorce and ten years of absence from a Hollywood career, the author plays his quest for love in front of the camera. The first question concerns the veracity of all this: what is written, what happened by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no", describe Mr. Berowitz as a low average human being. If you are looking for a self-fiction about love like this, I recommend you to read independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... so much against my country, France. I know that Americans generally say that the French are arrogant (which might be true at the time), and so on. Do not think I could not love this movie just because of that anyway.
