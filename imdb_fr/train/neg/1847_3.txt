SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you gather a group of people without talents to make an "extreme" horror film. Any kind of acting, production, scenario, FX, etc. go through the window to try to create a "shock value". Now, do not get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" movies, and the more shady / mediocre, the better - but it's always nice to see SOME talent from someone is involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC tells the story of Harry Russo - an addict addict monster who takes the order to kill the mannequin of his ventriloquist, Rubberneck. He spends a few moments killing random prostitutes and other people, and shouting how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (it's "whores" for those of you who do not speak New York-ese .. .) and how he wants to rape them in the ass. There are some weak necrophilia scenes, very little gore and nudity to mix things up a bit, but nothing you have not seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that redeems that I can find in this film is the hilarious yelling of our main man, Harry (involuntarily?). He keeps talking about wanting to kill everyone and doing it in the ass, and it gets really comical after a while. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there would be some sort of homo-erotic nuance in this movie, with all the chatter and constant shots of Harry running with his hangin dong. In all honesty, this joker is better known in this film than the few girls who show a little T-and-A (and a little full, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is slightly amusing as a unique watch, but I can only recommend it to those who want to say that they watched a film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this trash ... A generous 3.5 / 10
