This film is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What's wrong with writers, producers and directors? How could they get money for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is at best poor, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK, but then it repeats until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm the biggest loser for not turning off this silly movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this film because Scott Adkins was there ... and he is ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10 because it's the lowest rank that IMDb has to offer. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: watch a movie Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
