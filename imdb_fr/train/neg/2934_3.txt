Simon Pegg plays the role of Sidney Young, a clumsy and clumsy British idiot who works as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After having a very lucky chance, he started working for the highly respected Sharps magazine run by a certain Jeff Bridges from New York. It's more the devil wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. The unbelievable interest of love is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for laughs but does not really enthrall the screen of her passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney goes through emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget his journalistic principles in order to publish articles in the magazine. Of course, he is finally seduced by the glitz and glamor of the world of celebrities, especially the young star Sophie Maes (Megan Fox of Transformers). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself has experienced similar feelings in this film and to some extent Run Fat Boy Run, considered one of the best British humorous talents ruined by the United States. <Br/> <br /> All in all, it's a forgotten comedy. Please, come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
