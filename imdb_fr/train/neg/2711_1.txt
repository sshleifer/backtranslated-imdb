Even if you could forget that these boring characters were personally witnesses of all the important moments of the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson family and no one died in Altamont), this movie was still horrible. I had the impression that the "writers" had just locked themselves in a room and were still watching "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's movies from the 60s and calling him "research". A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". He was right.
