This film seems to be a scam for many films that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin keeps coming back in the movies, and frankly, one wonders if he has an excellent agent, or do filmmakers and producers like his quirky arias, complimented by this strange hairstyle he wears in most of his films. The only good film in which he appeared is "The Squid and the Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his principal wife, does not get much better; There is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A film to see at the risk of the spectator.
