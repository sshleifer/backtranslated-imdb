Oh dear. This film could have been subtitled "When writers go on strike!" What a stink. I had a lot of hope for that, especially after reading the critics of IMDb, which leads me to wonder about the entire rating system of IMDb, but it is a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc., so I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed is the least that can be said of the year. There are so many things wrong with this film, but I will limit myself to (a) the implausibility of ANY family behaving like these people (A mass aerobics workout? On which planet is THIS life? ) a murderer of love? Please), and the fact that Dan's character is so unfriendly, you wonder what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This film was packed with clumsy dialogues, squeaky directions, ridiculous sets and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have left after half an hour if we had not been with my parents, who do not go out much and do not like to waste money. Unlike the authors of this film, it would have been better to spend all the money spent on making this movie a bonfire - it would have been more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid that like the plague.
