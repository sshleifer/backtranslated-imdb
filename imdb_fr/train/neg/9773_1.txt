When that came out, I thought it was one of the most profane films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other filmmakers like him, the main films have been worse, from the point of view of language, than that .... but it is a brutal assault on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot, but it's become ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard half a dozen uses of the Lord's name in vain and countless words and answers. I wonder how many people came out of the theater watching this in 1990? I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that some of the feature film stars include Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, playing at least the evil "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is exactly the opposite: perhaps the worst trash character in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Depressing, lugubrious, semi-pornographic, disgusting: these are just some of the adjectives used, even by some liberal critics, to describe this story, which is even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics, all extremist liberals, have praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as was most of the paying public. It's amazing that anyone can praise such dirt. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good, friendly characters in this movie. It's a nasty and sick movie: one of the worst of the "modern era". In other words, unless you take pleasure in seeing child abuse, drug addiction, teenage prostitutes, again and again - two hours in a row of nothing but atrocities and wrongdoers. No thanks.
