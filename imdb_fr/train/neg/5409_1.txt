The Christmas secret was presented as a wonderful film, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS copies and DVDs of the finished film, which makes me think that the producers were really proud of this project. As a filmmaker, I got the impression that most of the performances had been called, even though Beau Bridges, like Nick, had had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this film on my CV otherwise very well. It was embarrassing. I was a fan since Walton's time, but I found myself tempted to look at his later works, as this offer was mediocre. <br /> <br /> For the defense of the actors, the staging was complex, mechanical, and completely amateurish. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered a malicious criticism and that negative assumptions have been made about my qualifications as a critic. I shot the film because it had good distribution and I was ready to enjoy it. However, I would challenge everyone to watch this movie and not want their money, even if it was on T.V.
