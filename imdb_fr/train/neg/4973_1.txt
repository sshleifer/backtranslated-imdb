I stopped for five minutes when Beowulf received an automatic crossbow with a double aiming shot. Not only do the crossbows not have a telescopic sight, but Beowulf beats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The terrible scenes of wooden play and the eternal darkness that undermine all original Sci-Fi films have not helped either. As I only had a few minutes to feel my bile back up and decide to watch I Love Lucy instead, that's really all I have to say. But, you might as well realize that this is a movie made for television and jump it here. <br /> <br /> A parody.
