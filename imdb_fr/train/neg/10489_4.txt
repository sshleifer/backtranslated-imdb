I do not know author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN was typical of her work, I would probably have little interest in her children's books. When I was a child, literature did not really interest me unless I had soldiers fighting monsters with a high death toll. <br /> <br /> Judging by this filmed version of TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I guess Pearce has written for middle class kids for a good part of Tom Long's story, his protagonist, s settles in a house without a garden and suddenly finds a metaphysics. Having your own garden was definitely something that working class people did not have in the 1950s, so I guess there is somewhere a subtext of the political class somewhere. There is also a love story involving a girl called Hattie, but again, are cynical children loving love stories? The worst criticism is perhaps that very few excitations or adventures occur in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a children's movie that seems dated by its source. It's harmless, but I'm surprised by the high rating given by BDIM voters. I wonder how many of them would have given so many good grades if they were 10 years old and had just seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
