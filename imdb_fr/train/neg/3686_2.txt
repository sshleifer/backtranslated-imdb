I'm surprised everyone (even critics) seems to think it was a good movie. It's the most clich√© thriller I've ever seen. We have the "bad guy" who wants to force the "good" (or girls in this case) to do something or suffer the consequences. The "good girl" of this film must use her intelligence and skills to defeat the "bad guy" and save the world and his loved ones. Use charisma, bravery and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (pretty name) in an airport. A coincidence brings another and soon, it seems that fate brings them together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, apparently getting along in all respects ... Is there anything else to this strangeness? These two could be meant for each other? Does destiny have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Homeland Security director by moving him from room to room so his men can attack him. Oh, if she does not, her father is dead. Although we never know the exact reasons why and who are really behind this madness, Jackson then explains how it will happen and why it is in Lisa's interest to help her. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats her evil plans with her intelligence and, in doing so, wrists her on the back of the neck, tripping him on chairs and hitting him with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she drives him ferociously through the Miami airport, where she has gone under security control and steals a car that she will then use to crush the man to whom he was ordered to kill his father. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson, who can get his hands on high tech weapons, needs the help of a hotel manager. Could he not just introduce a bomb into the building? Would not that make security safer for him and his team by leaving out third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they're going to do to someone they're threatening? Does not it make it easier to stop them by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best considering the film that was given to them. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to watch. In addition, I believe that Jayma Mays (who played the "adorable" Cynthia) will be someone we will see more often. Too bad, they were all caught with that. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
