Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house where she grew up recently, inherited from her late sister, without the knowledge of her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives there. Jennifer decides to sell it because she is in dire need of it, to Granny's displeasure. She also begins to have annoying recurring nightmares of a mysterious crow. There was really no one to identify with in this film. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, without resentment and narcissistic, while the grandmother seemed mean, sad and narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but no one with whom I have empathy, I had trouble worrying about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My note: C-
