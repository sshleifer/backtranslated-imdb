The biggest joke in the world. The largest and most exclusive indoor joke in the world. <br /> <br /> Emulating the cheeky and "eternal" humor of the offices, this film highlights the attraction of this film by creating a humor such as it would only be appreciated by the legal secretaries who write books. The public is invited to take on the unknown role of legal secretary and then empathize with the atrociously silly protagonist. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the fact that the legal secretary finds free time, listens to music and writes a novel text while working. These are his goals. You can not imagine the slap in the face when listeners discover that he has had a job that meets all three criteria, but then quits! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely eliminates the public's motivation to show empathy or even entertain a protagonist who has already thrown everything he complains about. <br /> <br /> Major obstacle, the humor of the legal secretary fails because they must be explicitly explained to the audience every time they occur. Without these accessories, the audience would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it is not necessary to explain to the audience what is funny.
