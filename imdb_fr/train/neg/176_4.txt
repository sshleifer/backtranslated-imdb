<br /> <br /> I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. He came right after the first one. For some reason, this movie has always interested me. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was lame to see how this guy got involved in making the movie. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequence, half of the murders / attempted murders were basically without reason. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, he captured the co-writer because of creative differences, but what was the problem with the attempt to kill the casting? No casting, no film. He wanted it to "look real when they died"? If it should be a big budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first, the captured girl escapes and Stanley ends up scrambling and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film had potential. And the saddest of all ... the really sad part ... I would look at a "Cabin by the Lake 3". Only because I like Judd Nelson and he is the only positive element of this sequel.
