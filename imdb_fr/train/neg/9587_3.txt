Soho recreation of the 1950s (London) and the rising population. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more no less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here, he forgets that two minutes with people who can not really act is one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking? Besides who is the audience? Who cares about a book that was remembered so well, when? The usual London story of the changer taking his chance. <br /> <br /> What could slide this movie even lower? Oh, I know, third-rate songs that sound as if they were created on the spot. David Bowie repeats the title of the film again and again and that's the highlight. The soundtrack is made of clay pigeon. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a good thing. Good recreation of the Soho period. Too bad they can not think of anything to put in front.
