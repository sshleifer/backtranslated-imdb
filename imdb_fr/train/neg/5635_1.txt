I, too, like Dafoe as an actor, but I lost a few hours of my life watching this movie. I still can not believe I managed to watch it in its entirety. Was the movie really useful ?, And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see that horrible pathetic excuse of a movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I have not discovered the facts but Dafoe is married or sees the terrible actress in this movie in real life, if any? Was it an attempt to revive his career, if I'm afraid it was not successful? in the hope that I can actually delay watching this movie, even if someone takes my comments into account and decides they would rather watch the painting drying out ...
