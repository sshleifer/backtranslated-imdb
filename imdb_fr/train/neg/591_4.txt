I was really very disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and it created a good atmosphere and suspense, but when we finally managed to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just a psychopath with skin problems ... again . Whoop-de-do. Another crazy movie ... as if we did not have enough. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the "creep" is really disturbing to watch, and the way it moves and the strange sounds makes it pretty scary, but I'm tired of renting a film like this to discover that the monster is human, even if it is crooked, insane and whimsical. When I saw all the control rats at the beginning, I was hoping for a kind of hybrid rat-monster hybrid ... it was really disappointing to see the Creep revealed. <br /> <br /> In addition to that, some things in this movie have no meaning. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why on earth does the Creep kill the security guard? What's the problem, besides signing a good message that says, "Hi, I'm a psyche and I live here!"? It's stupid, and does not seem to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> what did he eat there? I had the impression that he had been walled up, and only the unexpected opening in this tunnel section let him let go ... so, did he chew rats all that time, and if yes why have they dragged so much around him? Why is it so hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not quite his best performance ... but seems to persist despite injuries equivalent to those that annihilate the non-psycho characters of the film. <br /> <br /> The comment of the DVD says that we are destined to sympathize with Creep, but I find it just disgusting. It's a pretty good movie, but it has ruined so many possibilities that it makes me sick.
