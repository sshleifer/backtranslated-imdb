All right, let me start by saying that nothing in this text will surprise anyone who has read the other comments. That being said, MY G-D, THIS FILM READED! I mean, WOW, I did not know it was possible to spend as much money as obviously and go out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman probably presented this film at one point, but refused because of the poor quality of the screenplay! The only reason this movie was created is that someone said, "Hey, zombies are popular, video games are popular, what game can we get that contains zombies?" Resident Evil? another one came first Silent Hill No, too quiet People will never sit in a dark room just to be stupid Hey, Sega did not have a game in which people were running around the zombies? They came out of the platform, we could have some for pennies! "<br /> <br /> Basically, they did their best to make a film that looks like video game, even shooting in combat as if the characters were playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem is that the original game was horrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> bad-film-merchandising-made-in-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-then-shippe d-on-and-bought-by-morbid- and their parents-for-Christmas horrible. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The case was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And it was the ARCADE version. The house version was even worse! With the homemade version, you did not even have the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were ridiculously bored by this useless game! But I am moving away from the subject. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they have gone as far as netting scenes of the actual game during the fight scenes. HUH ??? Did not the publisher have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was really a fight? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot in the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix style effects. The problem is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the character's POV). Maybe that's why they've integrated the graphics of the game, to let you know they were referring to the game ... Well, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Whatever Anyway, the only thing that made the COMTE experience enjoyable at a distance was the fact that everyone in the theater was laughing at the film aloud, so my hysterical laughter and my general disbelief were taken for granted. banal and did not make me fired. <br /> <br /> In summary up, do not go see this movie! Do not even deign to rent it when it comes out in video in a few weeks. Run. Just run.
