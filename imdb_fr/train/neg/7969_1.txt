OK another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK, it's not the worst movie I've seen this week, but it's still not good. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The Monster puzzle is a mix of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you know you have problems when someone shot a shotgun, the movie was not as bloody as we hoped, I mean one of the deaths is a heart attack. Again, I think that the acting is nothing, the sum of the actors must be a porn star and we must enter his underwear for some reason. <br /> <br /> The worst is the end, it leaves the field free for a little puzzle but it will never happen. > <br /> Funny 4/100 (a lot of fun) 73/100 acting 8/100 in general 12/100
