Oh man, does this movie ever bite! If you ever were afraid to see a re-release of the slasher genre, made as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher movies) Cut is it. Each shot is retreaded without a hint of self-awareness and actor. Oh, the actor is redefining the word horror. I should have known better because the direct Dutch translation of the title would have warned me.
