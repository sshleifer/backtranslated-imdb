I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. Based on a short story by science fiction author Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, Siamese twins separated from their family by an impresario to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, the movie is also too clever in half (if you forgive the pun). By mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) go astray fairly quickly. I never knew if I should take all this seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it was a bit too much. In addition, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. Sometimes I was reminded a bit too much of Hedwige and The Angry Inch, a film that I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not so good, any more than the main characters were nice. A more unfavorable comparison would be the Velvet Goldmine, also disappointing.
