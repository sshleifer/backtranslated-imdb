"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought. Basically, here's the show: The Cavemen are an alternative race, they face prejudices, and so on. It is very likely that the most stupid idea ever created; almost worthy of prison for writers. A show featured cavemen entering a club, trying to pick up girls, then nothing else had happened. It sounded like listening to a 22-minute dialogue with Andy Rooney, followed by death with steak knives via dwarf cannibals. For those who have not yet seen this show, here is an example of a dialogue: "You are sure you agree to go out with a caveman." "Yeah, it's good, I got 10,000!" Hilarious ... Maybe the best writing I ever attended. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of horrible makeup cavemen, tackling difficult social issues ... It sounds like an entertaining night out. I also appreciate how recent ideas suggest creating a sitcom from auto insurance ads. I wonder if they will do the next gecko, so that I can have a new title for the worst show I have ever seen. I would say it's worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn off from something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows like this make me hope that there is a comet out there that is targeting the Earth. <br /> <br /> (Unratable honestly ...)
