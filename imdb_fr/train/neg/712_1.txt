When I started watching this movie, I saw Buffy's guy, Xander, and I thought how nice it was to make a living playing movies. Now, I can handle a strange movie, since it's a lot of strange movies, like David Lynch's movies, twin peaks, lost roads, and so on. However, he reminded me mockingly of the zany websites on conspiracy theory that make absolutely no sense. I mean come on the Nazis who conspire with America to make an impious trinity of evil powers? I was surprised that they do not mention the hollow earth in this film with Hitler flying saucers and lizards. Maybe if you had 60 grams of heroin with this film, that would make sense, but I do not tolerate drugs as if I did not forgive this movie. It should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so that good old Alex can get another actor job. This was not his role, but the script did not make sense. Sorry.
