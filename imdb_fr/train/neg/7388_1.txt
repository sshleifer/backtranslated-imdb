drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved Segal's first films and I feel like the only one who's always loyal to him. I just saw this movie (ok, I fell asleep at about 90%, so I did not see the end). When I woke up and was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I would not submit to this movie and dare to know what happened at the end. There was something strange in the voice of Segal and the others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice had been doubled, but in the same language (the Australlian is English, right?). Anyway, if I had 10 inches, they would all be blamed for this Segal injustice.
