I saw the first dwarf movies and sometimes I did not have fun watching it. Many famous TV actors / comedians appear in the first part and present, in fancy costumes, small episodes typical of their stand-up program. This is precisely the problem with which the second film must struggle. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You know most of the jokes that are often boring and stupid and you always feel that their goal was to integrate each Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to come back on stage. The story is not important: the fairytale story typical of Rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. I was expecting something like that, but I could not complain. In fact, I complain about the authors of lazy stories that have a complete story; their only business was to bring in a lot of jokes and parodies but they did not understand it anyway. This shit is, apart from the superb appearance of Helge Schneider, a waste of time and money (if you do not like it, remove 2 points from my assessment). broadcast free every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL. I'm sure you'll recognize some of the "laughs" I saw last night at the movies.
