The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar has the super powers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Apart from the typical comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I do not see anything positive in this film. The story resembles what the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoors' long-range shooting with a shotgun is the director's slightest mistake. Apart from Tashan directors to make this film, there is no other Tashan. I regret to waste my money in this film and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.
