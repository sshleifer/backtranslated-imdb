Not that I get really excited at the sight of the realistic blood loss, but when I put on a DVD waiting for a bloodbath, and what I get is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the end of the fake slap asinine, and that turns. an office chair, I end up telling myself "it's 43 minutes of my life, forever". I would not consider this or a flower of flesh and blood as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of Flesh and Blood had some hard points to watch. The devil's experience does not have. It was at best, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectations were too big. I put the DVD thinking "oh man, it'll be sick." After watching them simulate the girl about a thousand times, I watched her in rapid advance. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this film. 1) People who are looking for movies in F just to see how really F'd, or 2) the most complete horror. I looked for this film and the other films about the guinea pig for this last reason, but even if I fell into the category of first, this film would not float my boat. In fact, I could imagine that this film would increase the thirst for blood ... as in "Would you like to kill B * TCH ALREADY !!" So, in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collection purposes. If you want a carnage that traditional horror does not provide, get some traces of death. Of course, it sucks too, but at least you will get the blood and guts you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can understand that anyone praising this crap is because they feel they should. No artistic merit that I can understand, no reason for his notoriety, nothing. Just a lame attempt to be shocking.
