Do you like to get up? So, get away from that ... <br /> <br /> During the first few rounds, there are good comics, but unless they have cute qualities, they have a chance to snowball . Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I hurt as much as the comedian aside, when I see who the twisted judges let in. <br /> <br /> 1 of my top 4 did better than the preliminaries. Half + of the finalists gave me 0 laughs. Many of them have raised their equipment elsewhere, which does not seem to be a problem for judges. <br /> <br /> It's more fun than many other TV shows, but incredibly difficult to watch without thinking. what it could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my critics would lose their validity. Maybe an idea?
