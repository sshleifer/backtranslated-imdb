My family and I filmed Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old son loved), Hot Rod gives the impression that it looks like Oscar-winning material. The only thing that could have saved this film was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg for making this movie. I will admit however that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the film was in the 80s, but with the majority of music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay home and watch the test pattern on your local TV channel. Or, if you are ready to look at it, people under the influence might benefit.
