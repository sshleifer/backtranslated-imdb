I had to watch the movie for my work, so I did not pay (on the contrary, I was paid), but I still found that the film was bad, much more than the average. The jokes were lame, the two main actresses ... well, to use the "age of women" division of the women's age group in Hollywood, they are no longer in their age "hot chick" but rather in "their age". What annoys me the most in the movie is the main plot of the plot, in which "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​is almost completely plagiarized expect the murder). All in all, a piece of bland shit.
