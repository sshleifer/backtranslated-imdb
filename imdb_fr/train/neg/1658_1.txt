This is perhaps the most boring film in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie with actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than watch this movie again. He quickly switched from the DVD player directly to the trash. My apologies to those of you who have apparently loved this movie, but you probably also liked New Coke. I do not know why anyone would have liked this film, it is slow, dull and without any real plot. You wait 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand that it was done in 1976, but it was a time when television was bad. Thank goodness, Disco and Three's Company left with goggles and Bay City Rollers. Oh, just my thoughts.
