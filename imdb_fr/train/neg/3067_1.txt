It's just bad. Sometimes the remakes, even if they are away from the original, are good in themselves. They can bring another point of view and get an interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. It was as poorly thought out and realized as possible. It was not good even standing alone. Viggo Mortenson is a leading player, but some of his selections of roles and projects leave much to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was an exciting psychological adventure. It's not an adventure at all, and it's neither pleasant nor entertaining. This was done from an approach to making movies by numbers, incorporating elements of the plot that, according to Hollywood, will appeal to what they see as the audience that goes to the movies today. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is insulting that someone presents this as a feature film and even attempts to remake a cult classic as carelessly. The manipulative plot, the "make-obvious-to-do-nothing" aspects, ridiculous dialogues, stereotyped characters, amateurishness ... <br /> <br /> It's all just bad ... .
