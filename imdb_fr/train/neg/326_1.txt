This first film by Adam Sandler could be compared to his comic life at the same time in 1989. The constant recognition by his character of his genius hidden comic and his frustration with humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than of the scenario. The film is in no way comparable to his hit movies, such as Big Daddy or even Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and fun way when making this film, just like his character. The majority of the film's "jokes" come from Sandler who talks to himself, usually about his unrecognized comic talent, and who gets beaten up because he's too ugly and he can not have women. The film is difficult to watch too, because it is not treated like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and the audience throughout the film, often referring to the low budget or dubious content of the film. The film is finally awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I had even seen this film once it was finished, lest, if he discovered more, it would ruin Sandler's career. Pass this one to the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
