Oh my god, what a horrible movie. Everyone involved is involved in the film. Unfortunately, it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this, I would be even more angry. This film is unassailable. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow and uninteresting movie? No wonder he did not have a lot of distribution, everyone involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camcorder and my big toe. Beyond boredom, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost a little standing in my eyes. It must be some kind of sick joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone even suggests that you look at him, kill him.
