Just trash. I'm a big fan of the Cusacks, that's the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I could see their presence is the in-depth, low quality recovery of their exact roles of Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the role of movies as a political satire fails miserably because it is too obvious for even the weakest in the world to be used for anything. And to present it as a satirical satire would simply insult even chimpanzees. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but since it's nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same category as the Spartans (watch if you're a fool) in terms of political satire, let them Quiet enough, it disappears in the darkness that it absolutely deserves.
