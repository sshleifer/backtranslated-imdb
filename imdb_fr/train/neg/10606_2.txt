After seeing the more modest and timid versions of the "Universal Soldier" franchise, I hoped and prayed for Van Damme to resume his role as Luc Devoreaux in a second Unisol movie. Well, it seemed that this prayer had been answered, but not as I had hoped. Universial Soldier 2 is an intense reading of poetry at your neighborhood library. No, even that would be more intriguing. The fight sequences are first-rate, Bruce Lee quality, which is the only redeeming factor of all this pathetic excuse for a movie. This and have the old legend of the WCW "Goldberg" playing the villain. However, it would have been better to place Goldberg as Seth's sidekick. <br /> <br /> We were the most offended by the film itself. It's as if some movie school students slapped him. This film was built in a black hole. For example: Luc's daughter, Hillary, looks at least 11-13 years old and the first film was shot just seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me that! The role in which Luke's partner was killed and turned into Unisol is simply ridiculous! You mean there was an experimental Unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the film. Let's go there. The director could have spent more time with this film than the first and sew all the holes in the plot. But oooh nooo! <br /> <br /> Speaking of the plot, it sucks! Compared to the first movie, the plot of Universal Soldier 2 is diluted and worthless. Where are the thrills in which Unisol gets upset and restores his last memories in a raging supermarket thinking about his desert storm or something? It was the dawn of the millennium, you would have more audience if it had been held in a future dystopia / orwell steeple. Corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad and sad sequel. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3 and Hell, even the cheap class fool / classless "The Class of 1999" of Terminator is more entertaining than that one!
