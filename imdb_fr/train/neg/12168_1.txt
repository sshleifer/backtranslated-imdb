This movie was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wants to have a high number of people. The game was horrible. The murders were very badly acted. For example, when Ally found herself stuck in the toilet, I guess it was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the booth, you see Ally, so Angela has to go and get her. The part that really touched me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar rope and shocked her. It was horrible to act and two, why not turn around and hit the bitch?!?!? Then, when Molly is being chased by Angela if you have neigh, why do not you turn around and stab her ??? So stupid. This film was bad ...
