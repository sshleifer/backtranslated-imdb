[I saw this film one last time on a public TV channel, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" "(sic) of Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe that anyone would let his daughter be part of this little racy movie that today could well be considered to be on this side of" porn kiddie "at the age of 5. They all wear diapers and are in a living room that serves milk rather than alcohol. The "cash" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatale" at the bar and talks to the soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not really need their lollipops or their money, because her bag is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a little black boy makes a suggestive dance on a table nearby (!). <What a strange movie. . . infants using a racy dialogue playing adult roles in a room. Who imagined this stuff?
