It's a good thing that The Score is a farewell performance for Marlon Brando because I would not want to think of him coming out with Free Money. <br /> <br /> In his later years, Brando is more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film that Welles would have made to find the financing of his own work. Brando is the guardian of a local prison, which in America, when it is located in a small rural setting, is generally the largest employer in the region. This gives the person in charge a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has one weakness he addresses, his twin bimbos, also known as girls. Even when they simultaneously fall pregnant with two losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to dad. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid because Brando is ready to give them a job in the prison where they work in conditions not much better than the convicts have. What to do, but commit the theft of a train that runs through the locality and contains money spent from time to time to be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has a few moments of humor, it is generally well below the talents of everyone involved. Some of them include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as a daughter-in-law, but also an FBI agent with the right arrow. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the cast have been working with someone who many consider to be the greatest American actor of the last century. Without Brando's presence and some 40 years ago, Free Money would play the drive-in circuit in the red American state, where the public could see how it gets satirized. <br /> <br /> we try to do satire.
