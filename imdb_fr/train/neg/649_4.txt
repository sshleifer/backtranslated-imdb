OK, this movie was made for one reason, and only one, to make money! The producers obviously did not care about the destruction of a classic horror movie. I knew that this film would be void as soon as it was a pg-13. How many slashers of pg-13 have been good? It's like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NONE !! Prom Night 1980 was certainly not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that stays true to its genre and does not want to be more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way he treats the killer and I have 3 big problems with him ................... .. <br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, he was locked in a psychiatric institute and he escapes through an air conditioning duct !! WHAT IS GOING ON? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain, the killer wants the death of all the main victims and his friends to be able to keep it alone, he says, he loves it but the next minute, he tries to kill her, so he wants to kill her, love her or just rape her ?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this scene where he kills the main victim's boyfriend while he's basically asleep and does not notice it, it's all stupid. 2 out of 10 stars. A stupid, stupid and stupid attempt by a horror movie
