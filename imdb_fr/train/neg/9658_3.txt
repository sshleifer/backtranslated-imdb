My God, what an amazing movie it is! It reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's film "We were soldiers" when "the company is not lost, they are just cut" and the other scene at Pearl Harbor when the British officer tells Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you, then God is helping the nation go to war with America! <br /> <br /> Gather the 3 films to get enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire desert. Sahara. <br /> <br /> The story of the isolated battalion may be very real, but the film could have done without all the American predatory jingoism propaganda attached to it: there were audible groans in the filming during the aforementioned scene at Pearl Harbor (no joke)) The lost battalion is however really in a class of its own. "<br /> <br />" Americans think they are unbeatable. "An inspired courage". "In fact, I got drunk on it and almost vomited everything is the swill that was vomited during this diarrheal disaster (the movie that is) <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were well done (3 stars for that) but if the scenario manure, then wrapped in Bright ribbons are always manure. The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote to these other screamers: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy, is also Australian: God shame !!!
