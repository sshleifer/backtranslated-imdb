I read Ben Mezrich's novel Reaper a few years ago and last night I came across this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although I have not read the story for years, the differences between the novel and the film are enormous. The very important elements that make it all plausible are simply written or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting to you, go get the novel. It's a lot, a lot, a lot better. <br /> <br /> 4 points out of 10, because it was hard to stop looking because of Ben Mezrich's great basic plot.
