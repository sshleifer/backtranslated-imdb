I rented I AM CURIOUS-Yellow in my video library because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at the beginning, it was seized by US Customs. he never tried to enter this country. fan of films considered "controversial", I really had to see it myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered on a young Swedish student of the theater, named Lena, who wants to know everything about life. In particular, she wants to focus her attention on making a documentary about what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and racial issues in the United States. Between interrogations of politicians and ordinary citizens in Stockholm, she sleeps with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that I'm 40 years old. A few years ago, it was considered pornographic. Really, sex and nudity scenes are rare, even if it's not like at least a cheap porn. While the minds of my compatriots find it shocking, in reality, sex and nudity are an essential element of Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, no doubt their answer to the good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the filmmakers for the fact that any sex presented in the film is rather presented for artistic purposes that simply shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study Swedish pie meat and potatoes (no pun intended). But really, this movie does not have much intrigue.
