This fits perfectly with the period as Axis & Allies played spy games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. This is not the best of movies, but certainly not the worst of the low budget movies previously described in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was very good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited Parkyarkarkus). Why he never had bigger roles goes beyond me. He played the ideal role of boyfriend / partner and saved the film ... on time. <br /> <br /> As said, this movie was part of a budget package of Superbox-Mart entitled War Classics. Eight movies for eight dollars, which included other unreleased movies that have some decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This scenario is ... well, not so sexy. Editing and cinematography are ... worse. If you can get around all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid & a great sidekick who unfortunately has never exploited his potential, go for success! If not, there are other World War II films to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
