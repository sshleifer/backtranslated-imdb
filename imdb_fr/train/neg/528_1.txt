I never expect a film adaptation to follow the novel closely (especially a dear friend, such as Evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer of the film, I thought that Evening be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, do not bother with this movie. It's so far from the book that the two are not alike. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housekeeper's son. Buddy is a drunkard, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think that one character managed to pass from the book to the screen. Oh, it just gets worse every moment. <br /> <br /> And really, Bridges of Madison did not he learn that cut in the story that we are supposed to be captivated in scenes of our heroes' adult children with odious and juvenile fights , just does not work on the movie? This film is a disaster. Jump.
