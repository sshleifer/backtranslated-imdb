I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and, being a fan of Nick Stahl, I just had to rent it. In all honesty, he probably should have stayed on the board. The concept was interesting and had a lot of smart twists, but I guessed them almost all before they arrived. And the movie went a little too far in the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer because of that, you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was excellent (especially given what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he still plays the same type of character ... too Paul Finch of "American Pie" for my taste. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst aspect of this film must be January Jones' emotionless performance ... I guess a pretty face is all that matters in Hollywood.
