This movie seemed to have everything to please with good camera, sound, movie, sets, music, costumes ... but the drum roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it was his bad acting or just a bad script, but I would say it was both. Given his role in this role, I struggled to root it to the end. I wish he had died in battle or in one of the fights between the sword and the knife. <br /> <br /> Then the conspiracy to kill the king was due to the fact that the king had not dined or slept with him Queen? Rather miserable. And go to the extreme to kill his own son? And to then push his lover as king successor? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the way in which all this was presented was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not recognize Gary Stretch, but he was awful. I've read another user's comments about voice dubbing, but I do not think his dubbing has been dubbed ... after all, he speaks English, does not he? It was really horrible. The lines were read right next to the coroner's table ... flat line. It may well be that he does not have the voice to support the fluctuations of tone. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I watched until the end, so the film had at least one "interest". It could have been more if the script / lines and the cast had received more work. The set and the film crew as well as very good films are what really made this film a priority. The casting and the story were all secondary. I give a 10 to the film crew.
