I am rarely moved to comment on a movie online. But I do not understand how it was made. That he has done? How could they think they were capable of making a feature film? Did they take a weekend class at a film school, get a big dad's check and kidnap David's family one by one until he agreed to participate? Or was he by chance a long-time friend of the family / distant relationship who was doing it out of sheer mischief? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he seems completely embarrassed to be there, mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera. In the meantime, the DOP had to be the Neighbors bumper, there seemed to be no sound design, the script, direction, and editing were catastrophic, and frankly, the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I can not be disturbed. I spend more of my life thinking about this movie.
