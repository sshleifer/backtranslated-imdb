So it was a HBO movie "Made for TV Movie", huh? Is this an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? What a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repetitive role (shooting, surviving, lying, being beaten, surviving, shooting, lying, and so on forever.) Call it a scenario, and the British embarrassed to see that one. Pathetic Timothy Dalton (or was he taking the p ***, it depends how much he was paid, I guess?). As for this other Brit, the bleached blonde, what happiness! There is a tendency to to glorify these super-violent "English-speaking" hooligans (sic) recently, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna's two films that managed to entertain and justify the violence by skillfully using irony and humor, as does Pulp Fiction However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre, definitely not to be missed.
