The original Boogeyman was a supernatural slasher movie, silly but entertaining. It was not a great movie, but fun in the right frame of mind. The third installment in this series, Return of the Boogeyman, is simply awful. It consists of two things. First, new pictures cheap and lifeless. Second, recycled bit charges from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateurish, but not in a fun way, but incredibly tedious. These images were clearly collected quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips of the first (and possibly the second) films. And then, do they process extracts from previous movies? sometimes reusing footage again and again. The only novelty in these parts is a voice that unnecessarily describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching this is really stultifying. <br /> <br /> The return of Boogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation film; the genre that exploits the public in a very cynical way. I want to keep this criticism brief and precise because this film does not deserve more. There is nothing of value here. This is worthless.
