I went in this movie hoping it was really horrible. And it was. Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before shooting this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson was unable to stage one of the fabulous performances I've ever seen. and love him for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (of the famous vicar of Dibley, among others), had about one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and ubiquitous, and humor was lacking. (However, there was a part of the film where Santa Claus entered the house of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Do not see this movie unless your only other alternative is to have a frontal collision with a train (in fact, maybe the train would be better ...)
