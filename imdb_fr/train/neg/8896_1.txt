I saw Brigadoon on television last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and I've been watching movies forever. I can honestly say that Brigadoon is the only one by far the worst I've ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local kids club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted the dry rot of the tears of the customers who had the misfortune to look at them. It is hoped that the stars of this film had a leather thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment they had to undergo seeing this film. The owners of this tripe should do a great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
