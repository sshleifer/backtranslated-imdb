I love science fiction, I'm fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I enjoy digital animation. I thought a film combining these three would be at least nice. I could not have been more fooled: the narrative (or lack thereof) was totally devoid of inspiration and lacked imagination - while imagination is usually the most important element of a story of science fiction. The dialogue and the game are even worse than in an average porn movie. Thomas Kretschmann, in particular, gives a new meaning to the term "poor performance". Bad acting would not have been such a big problem if only Bilal did not take himself seriously; all the lines sound like supposed to be poetic, it looks like Bilal really thinks he's done a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry to find in this piece of scrap metal, only pretension! This man should really stick to comics because he fails on all possible accounts as a director. The worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that watching this movie makes it a physically difficult experience. The graphics are so fake that they even make the werewolves of 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half of the characters are animated by a computer-generated image, it's quite a problem that the effects of CGI look so fake. If the Egyptian gods exist, Bilal is a dead man, because they will probably take revenge for the ridiculous way he describes them in this terribly bad movie.
