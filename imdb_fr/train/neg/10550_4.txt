After being a big fan of the ten-minute episodes of "Stella Street" on T.V, I waited for this film with enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately, I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the fact that almost all the gags and linings were removed directly from the TV episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic minutia, if the actors had told them once and could not be bothered to repeat them. I bought my copy on DVD and I felt cheated to have separated from my hard earned money to be able to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The plot of the film begins with Stella Street (a normal English Surrey street), gradually populated by 'some of the most famous personalities of the stage and screen of last forty years, "including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities of the street end up being diverted from their fortune by a local fraudster and forced to live like tramps and people of the working class. There are good times, but all in all, writers come up with an interesting idea and make it rather boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In T.V episodes, all characters are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the movie, Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. His imitations were not funny, and it seemed that his characters were included in the story only to give him something to do. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of Stella Street episodes, you might discover this entertaining movie. But if you were a fan, I think you might feel a little cheated. 4/10
