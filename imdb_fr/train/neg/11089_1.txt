A rather good movie, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder and was never found not guilty. The state of New Jersey did not show up for the third time after 20 years. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Take a lie test and leave freely". He did not take it. This film should never have been done, but the money is talking. Many people have spent their lives unjustly in prison and probably more blacks than whites. Why choose a false story? <br /> <br /> Jens
