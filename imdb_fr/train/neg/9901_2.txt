It really should have been a star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictable twists, all seen before the slasher film, that I gave him an extra star for the fact that it made me laugh ... although that has never been the case intention of directors Im sure. <br /> <br /> I do not often comment on movies, they must be sensational or, in this case, really bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey, I knew it was going to be mediocre because he has a unique nose for choosing the worst films. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, the joke of all this made me look at every possible path, probably for the hilarious voice of Mr. T, (do not relay Mr. T, but you will know what I mean if you take the trouble to look at this), if you look at it, make sure you do not pay to see it. It may have worked if they had actually planned the comedy, but I'm sure you'll find the strange laugh here and there at the farce of all this ...
