My child makes better videos than that! I feel ripped off the $ 4.00 spent on renting this thing! There is no date on the video box, apparently designed by Wellspring; And what's even worse, there is no production date for the original movie listed in the movie! The only date given is 2002, which suggests to an unsuspecting tenant that he has a recent movie. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad from the point of view that it was obsolete and no longer relevant for a given period of time, but precisely at the moment of its creation. I'm amazed that anyone takes the time and money to market it as a video. This could be of interest to students studying counter-culture of the 1960s, anti-war, anti-establishment, tuning, activation and abandon culture; but when you read the back of the video box, there is no reason to think that's what you get. However, if you make the mistake of praising it, it is probably best to watch it while you are taking drugs, so that your mind is more in line with the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Whatever your state of mind when you look at it, I can tell you that the situation will not improve after the first scene. so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll sleep well before the end.
