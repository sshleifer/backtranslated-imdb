This film can be judged from three points of view: story, profile of Amin, fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as a story, it mentions in passing the coup d'Ã©tat that has thrown Obote, the expulsion of Asians, and has as background the hi-jack Entebbe, but not in a coherent calendar. <br /> <br /> As a profile of Amin, it may be interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and, if it was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He understood this - which proves that Oscar-winning voters do not watch the films they vote on.) He ignores the relevant historical episodes of the novel, which have seen Amin and Uganda's history from the point of view of the doctor. He tells rather the fictional story of the Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the only incident Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to keep it together. The beginning is tense - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but sets up the story. The character of the doctor is well defined but gets lost in the second half of the film that suffers. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala he explains badly - seduced by power? Why he befriends, no one is strange. The character of the friend in the novel was lost because the Scotsman has the case instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous entanglement that does not even seem a little believable, but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of 'Amin closely. The man called Horse at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda drove to the left, not to the right, the license plates were composed of three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the defenses of the Ecuador ?! <br /> <br /> In short, if you have never heard of Amin, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to enjoy the game of Forest Whitaker, but the last hour will be boring. If you know Uganda or have read the book - do not see the movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so reckless, he was not.
