So I did that for Trent Harris, who occasionally teaches in the film department at New York University. I guess that's his only way to convince anyone to see his movie ... <br /> <br /> The documentary section at first dragged on. Yes, the kid is crazy from nowhere, but it's not enough to keep him interesting. <br /> <br /> See Sean Penn disguised as ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds he loses all his humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover played Larry, the narration was better, but I could not take it anymore.
