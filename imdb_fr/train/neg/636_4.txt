A couple of farmers is struggling in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the lead roles, arguing with false accents and highlighting old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and the land are the best things to have for men. They are considered a property and an investment. Since this is a big-budget film in which many extras co-operate, large sets are built, and special effects occur, filmmakers can not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is certainly the worst of the film. Her immutable face creates a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character with whom to sympathize. For his part, Paul Muni gives a better performance by showing his talents again. Another problem with the film is the end. It seems that Franklin did not know when to end the photo. This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
