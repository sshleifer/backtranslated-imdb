This film was awful, from conception to execution. Should the United States create a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? This is their premise? The United States concludes that the way to gain access is to win an obstacle course, such as a cross-country race, where the winner can ask the leader anything. And who better to win this race known as "play" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was an agent. Fortunately for our hero, there are gym equipment in lucky places, like the pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But beyond the horrible and horrible HORIBBLE principle lies the awkward awkwardness of romantic scenes, obviously depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be to hold a flag to indicate the course, and the worst climax of all time. After winning the race, our hero puts forward the wishes of the US government. And now all the efforts were worth it, because the United States has its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! IT'S YOUR TRIOMPHANT ENDING ?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But still, being such a bad movie, it can be very fun to watch. The cover alone, representing ninjas with machine guns, was enough to make me rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if ever I meet Kurt Thomas (the star of the gymnast) in real life, I kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 and a half turns in the position of pose.
