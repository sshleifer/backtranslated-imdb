The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie of my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is comic. Although I like Paul Muni, I can now say that I saw a film that does not do justice to its real ability. The only thing that saved me with this movie is its production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. In addition, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are selling easily and were revolutionary at the time. Apart from the value of the production, I can not say much else that is good or fun about this movie.
