1 st filmed on 03/08/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): 3D movie without mind on the flesh-eating zombies in a story of 3 films in a movie chronicle. And yes, we see zombies eating flesh parts in 3D! Wow, no! This has been done over and over in 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story and not the actual flesh. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The eating of the flesh was just added as an extra. In fact, we are almost bored throughout this 3-part chronicle because of the lame (twilight zone-like) finals that are easy to understand and revealed at a slow pace. The last story is actually the one with which the movie started (with a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we also see flesh-eating zombies in it. Well, I think I've said enough. Look at the classics, not this 3D party.
