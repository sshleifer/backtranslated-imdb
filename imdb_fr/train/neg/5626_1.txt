Taken this movie on the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I consulted IMDb to see what others thought about it. I was not surprised by the number of stupid people who enjoyed this stuffed toy. However, I was surprised when I reviewed the comments to read the Hated It categories and find that there were none. I was shocked by that. I always watch those who are hated because they are always the ones who hate a movie, no matter how good it is. One way or another, this movie was unscathed, I said no and I proudly proclaimed that I hated this movie! I know I should go into the details to explain why I hate this movie, but it would only give him more respect than he deserves.
