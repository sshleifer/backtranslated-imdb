This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not bad either. In my opinion, the PG13 movies are not scary enough, which is why I already knew I would be bored throughout the movie. Of course, there were scary things in the hotel room, but nothing we have ever seen. I guess I did not like that because I thought there were too many twists; it was getting old and repetitive. I did not understand if all that Cusack was living in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that have occurred. The film lags and when it's finally over, you want it to continue, because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the film is about. What I liked was the special effects. Apart from that, there was not much pleasure. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
