How many of these fake "slices of life" must be made? Let's hope it's not too much. <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a very conscious attempt by director Peter Solett to grab Hollywood's attention. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this movie, in particular, is that it ignores the audience and stacks up all the clich√©s in the book of Hollywood's supposedly "extravagant" production. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be "real" then "documentary style" camera, except that no documentary would shake the camera on purpose ... <br /> <br /> It's "pissed off" So do not waste time turning on the movie. <br /> This is "hip", so let the kids swear like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> Et cetera, et cetera. All you have left is a very conscious attempt to impress Hollywood that will not impress anyone outside the "rarefied" indie crowd that always seems to be hailed by all the bad movies.
