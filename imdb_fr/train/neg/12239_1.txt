Since I was eight, I am a big fan of wrestling. It did not matter which federation I was watching. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, action is everything I've watched. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I was just expecting another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, it was the night when one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada was a real human being, a victim of a waterfall gone awry. You can not do much to change the situation. But what happened after Owens' death made me very angry. <br /> <br /> Rather than ending pay-per-view and doing what's right as a human being, WWE decided to protect what came first - money pay per view goes as if Owens' death never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made stupid decisions in his life, but it's by far the stupidest decision he's ever made. <br /> <br /> And that shit to say that Owen would have wanted the aid stand perspective to stay. Leave me alone. When someone dies on a payroll, his common sense is to stop him. It's like a policeman firing at a robber or an abuser, then let the man die so he can go home and call him back as if the man's life had never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no. It does not matter what happens. Owen will be missed and thank you for the memories for all the moments you have given us.
