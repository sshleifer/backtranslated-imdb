Despite some exciting (and daring) sequences, NBTN never starts. There are exploding boats, hat pin kills, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic scenes of horror or mystery, but they are peppered with long periods of time. pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks bored. It's a shame, because many sequences would be considered daring at the time the film was shot. <br /> <br /> Add to that the British characters "too clean" and you will feel like you are in a Sherlock. Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very ordinary. There are plenty of possibilities for great campaign shots or complex scenes of a person in a bonfire, but it's unimaginative and boring. <br /> <br /> Certainly reserved for fans of Lee and Cushing.
