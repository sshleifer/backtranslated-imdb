Eva Longoria proves that she can not make a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and besides, that she does not even really have a comic timing. She is annoying and annoying as a ghost returning to earth to prevent a psychic cook from going out with her widowed fiance. The fiance is portrayed by Paul Rudd, streaming and unattractive, while the psychic is interpreted by Lake Bell, bringing to the film all the anemic energy that he has. I felt very sorry for Bell because she seems to have comic skills and worked overtime to make the equipment work. Unfortunately, she faces the insurmountable task of making any film starring Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is dragged along with the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic". <br /> <br /> "Above his dead body" has pushed me aside, because of his laziness and lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can not be funded, because huge sums are spent on shit like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How much do they think the moviegoers' audience is stupid? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
