I had a hard time getting through this stage. It was extremely slow and I sometimes wondered when the plot of the movie would really come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to slow down and I wondered when it would end. I am normally a person who likes a good independent file from time to time, but that does not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they had tried to shoot a lot of this movie. At one point, it seemed to become political, which I'm not a big fan of in the movies. If you are looking for a slow movie with little or no plot, then this is the right movie for you. As far as I'm concerned, I felt I had lost 2 hours doing something else.
