Good sorrow, I can not even begin to describe the poverty of this film. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much at first. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher movie is pre-destined to miss the ummm ... slashing, so nobody should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it's the level of incompetence and clich√© displayed in every other aspect of this movie that really blew me away. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here is a soap opera for books ... IT NEVER CHANGES - breaking the basic rule of basic writing on the screen - the development of characters. If you think that at the end of this film, the poor little girl will turn around and end up kicking asses, then think again. <br /> <br /> On top of that, we probably have the least intriguing killer (and certainly the least scary) of all time. I'm not kidding when I say that Dora the Explorer has wicked villains more frightening than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because any potential tension or gratification is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could he stay to fill 2 hours of time on the screen ? <br /> <br /> Closets, what is it? <br /> <br /> Heaps of cupboards: big cupboards, small cupboards, cupboards with ice, cupboards with Narnia, as many damn cupboards that you will not want to dress any more for another year. In fact, this film should have been called "CLOSET", and include a picture of a big scary coat rack on the DVD case. On the back, there could have been a picture of the audience falling asleep and a quotation from Roger and Ebert - a little to the extent of: "what is the f * @! Have we just lost our time to watch! "
