I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. I felt like watching this movie for 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they thought when they did that. Jeffrey Dahmer is murdered and his end is endless. It was as if they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a TV episode of Sopranos. It ends suddenly and you know there will be another episode next week. I also felt like watching Part 1 of a two-part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they became lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to do a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie, they all sound with great precision. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walk in the woods. Suddenly, I hear this music, then the writing appears on the screen and tells how Dahmer served a two-year sentence. He was attacked by another detainee and killed at the age of 34. Woods at his death in prison. Why not show how he got there? Why not show Dahmer's lawsuit? Why not show more details? I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped in all directions. In fact, I found myself saying incredulously, "This is it, is it the end?" I want to conclude this criticism by saying that there is still a good movie about Dahmer. To the filmmakers, I would like to say that if you want to do it, do it well.
