This movie has a few things to do from the start. Having Dani Filth as lead actor will automatically render some people like this movie. Certainly, I like Cradle of Filth and I have been listening to the soundtrack of this film long before I look at it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and an excellent lead. The independent filming style of the film is excellent for the scary factor. There are some wonderful actresses in this movie. To be low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the disadvantages. There is VERY little discussion throughout this movie, so little about character development. It is difficult to fear for the life of soft and static characters. When there was a little talk, the F bomb was plentiful, popping up in random places. Yes, I understand people who swear, but it seems that a pre-teen boy wrote this script and thought it was cool to include all the language. The scenario, which I could draw from it, was rather good, although many parts remain unanswered and the lack of conversation often leaves one wondering what is going on. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porn for people who love sex and violence, but like a porn that tries to shoot a screenplay, it does not work very well. Praise him, however, if you are a morbid person who seeks to satisfy your appetite for blood and flesh.
