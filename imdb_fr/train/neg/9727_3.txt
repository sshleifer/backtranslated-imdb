Another of my digs in the trash of business, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a trashy horror charge with screaming ladies. Newsreel "about the young couple who was exposed to a nuclear explosion and who was totally absorbed until the first person ignited ... almost embarrassing to watch.When the heroine turned out to be suffering from the same condition as the main character (the ability to light his own farts without the help of a match), it would almost feel like someone had launched the idea at the last moment ("it'll be ok!" We hear them almost ...) Regarding the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The film appeared as cheap tat - if you pay over Â£ 1.50, you've already done it.
