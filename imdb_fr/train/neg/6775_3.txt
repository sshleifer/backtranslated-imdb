I was very happy to find this film in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in services, director Stanley Donen, for now, what does not like? This is the kind of movie that makes me think of two things: when did everyone involved (including well-known names) realize that they had a turkey on their hands and what is the worst aspect of this film among many contradictory aspects? I always think about the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the sinuous story, ahead of the sometimes pretentious scenario, the uncertain tone, the uncertain tone, the lack of coherent and well developed characterization and the lack of relationship between the characters . We must add a game of action very unequal to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors struggled with this kind of things and in addition, they seem under-repeated. Quite often, they can hardly get out their lines fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual, charming and urban character, but sometimes seems uncomfortable and staccato in his speech. I must say, however, that I was relieved when the initial suggestions of his character were paired with the incredible vulgar Jayne Mansfield and disappeared with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What is there to love in the film? - For me mainly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and with a dignity similar to that of Grace Kelly. In general, the film is nice to watch. The navy characters are very elegant in their uniforms - but you must marvel at the ugly black Fu Manchu tunics they wear in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can not seem elegant in his. As for credit, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me it was in the interest of hearing a pre-Hogan Hogan hero, Werner Klemperer speak without a supposed German accent!
