Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary via the cinema, has written, directed and produced other films on controversial topics, but this may be the first time she has had wide coverage thanks to the TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she scrambles the issue intelligently by introducing eugenics and birth control, giving the impression that they are equivalent to abortion. Her writing skills and other cinematographic skills are well presented here, but we can forgive her for wishing she used them less didactically. If you're wondering what Tyrone Power's "famous father" looked like, here's your chance. Fashion and automobiles from 1916 are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's nice even if you do not like propaganda.
