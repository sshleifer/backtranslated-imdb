The suites have the bad habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give you is that they keep this old tradition. These three stories have nothing to envy to the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> The best of the trio is by far that of a wooden idol who comes alive to take revenge on the thugs who killed his owners. The second story concerns a lake monster, which seems to be nothing more than many floating residues. One wonders how one could be afraid of it. The third story includes a Stephen King cameo as a truck driver, but apart from that, you'll find a pretty steadfast story about the victim of a road accident who comes back from the dead for the person who stunned. Look at the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done it, just do it.
