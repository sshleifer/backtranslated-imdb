You can not imagine how anxious I was to be the king of the ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I was waiting for the first European with an excessive anticipation. Especially since I really loved Dagon, Gordon's latest achievement. The king of the ants was created here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to introduce him. Unfortunately, I could not go congratulate him for that later. King of the Ants is his most unprepared and mediocre film to date. In reality, the level of quality never exceeded the standards of the TV thriller. The plan of the plot is terribly routine and, with the exception of a few mediocre scenes, the typical Gordon Touch is never recognized. On top of that, the already weak scenario has more holes than a bowl of Swiss cheese! This is a young wannabe scammer hired to commit murder. So, he does it. And of course, they do not pay it. And of course, he falls in love with the victim's wife. And, of course, he takes revenge. mention and they are the only ones to remind you that you are still watching a Stuart Gordon movie. Actor performances are below average with McCenna as a heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as a chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as a kind hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the sadness of the story quickly becomes irritating, while the effects of makeup are not even enough to satisfy amateur horror lovers. I read some other reviews on King of the Ants, claiming it's Gordon's best since it's finally a mature and challenging film. Well, if that's the case. I prefer to stay immature and give Re-Animator another view, thank you very much. Oh well, I guess all good filmmakers are exhausting themselves and finding inspiration. Too bad, they also defeated Stuart Gordon.
