This film is now my gauge to which all other films will be compared ... as in "was it as stupid as Revolver?" I, too, was last night in front of the Toronto International Film Festival audience, where a room filled with more than 2,000 people came out in a strange silence after being completely stunned by 2 hours of pure nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had a goal. In the first 10 minutes, he receives a proposal from Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (Soprano fame) that makes NO SENSE OF ALL! Then there are gunshots and Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then an animation, Ray Liotta's naked buttocks, a lot of gunshots, gnashing of teeth, a house of art that wants to be pretensions and other annoying bodies that cause bursts of laughter at every performance ... which I am not quite sure of the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks to be smarter than an average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he is portrayed by Yogi Bear. The stories may not have gone anywhere, but the posture was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was there.
