I do not know how connected they are, but I'm pretty sure Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). A very similar scenario, and even some scenes and sets look very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see it. <br /> <br /> This one is moving very slowly, but since it's a French film from the late 60's, you have to expect a style. In retrospect from the point of view of one of the girls revisiting the school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially since the audio from each overlap (ie, hear the flashbacks by looking at the present and vice versa). In addition, the "girls" are a little old to think that they are in a boarding school. Finally, not a lot of character development to tie you even to the movie.
