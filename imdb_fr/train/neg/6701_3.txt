I have been an environmentalist for years and I was really looking forward to seeing this show. I was ready to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn great things. I could probably if I could go beyond Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure all this is staged to look like a reality show and appeal to this class of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Naudage with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Given that Ed is such a good newsfeed, maybe a second very serious exposure to the environment would be a good idea. It is not necessary to give up things. <br /> <br /> I do not record any more episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a real green show could be going on.
