I watched this movie with friends a few months ago and I still laugh today thinking of total stupidity. The first scenes alone were hilarious. I will not spoil anything for those who wish to see it, I would not spoil the laughter. Needless to say, during the entire time I watched this movie, I tried to understand what the characters in this movie were doing exactly. However, towards the end, we were all bored, because the initial hilarity and shock of such a random film disappeared. There is no plot and no decent actor trace. The characters are about as developed as those in the "Learn to Read" kindergarten book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene irrelevant.
