Somewhere, there must be a list of the worst gay movies of all time. Those who have very long pictures of stars sitting and looking thoughtfully in space, or those where they focus unbearably long on kittens who eat spaghetti. This image of motion sickness tells the story of a boy and a boy. They live, love and swim and stay stuck in caves. One of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother. They talk and walk, swim and have sex. drunk, then parting and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then comes out. There is a lot of fast-paced, rewind and long thoughtful plans showing one of them looking in space or sitting or doing nothing. I think it's kind of a gimmicky film technique or maybe the film is so bad that they have to fill it with long and lost shots because otherwise, if they had to rely on a plot or a story, the film would last about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, this is the 30th gay movie I've watched in the last 6 months and some of them (most) have been very formative, predictable and boring, but it's one of those terrible wastes. So far, the best was "Beautiful Thing". So, I looked at that, and after the very first opening shot that lingered, I thought, "Oh, no, it's going to be creative, sinny mah," but I gave him a chance and watched and then when he finished I threw the DVD in the trash. Sorry I did not like and if you liked, sorry if I offended.
