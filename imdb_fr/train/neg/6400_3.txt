The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from dismal conspiracy, weak scenario, lamentable play and laughable continuity in the joint edition of this mess. There are very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. When I was a kid, I remembered this as a vehicle of the two comedians-comedians, but there was always something strange in the flow and the feeling of what was conveyed in each scene and its connection with the plot in general. Looking at him again after many years, he shouts of schlock-a-mania. I do not care so much about racial controversy, it would not bother me to see a film tackle this problem with a little lightness. The most obvious fault for me is that the scenes are arranged as a series of sitcom pieces (not very good at times), which are not linked, which were stapled together by the editor after a sleepless night at the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations downward, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and scenes, giving the impression that no one really knows what to get out of the storyline. Not that it's a jewel to start. I feel bad for both actors whose legacy is spoiled by this disaster that should never have happened. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
