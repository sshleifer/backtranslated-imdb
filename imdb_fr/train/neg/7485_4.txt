Certainly, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you'll know it. <br /> <br /> In truth, Martin, the main role, is misinterpreted. He does not make the big slapstick for which he is known, movies like "The Jerk", but rather plays a kind of intermediate character that does not work. Hawn, with no one to play with, is terrible. Cleese is the only member even partially funny. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much it could have changed, but the characters seem to lack any common sense. They cross New York without doing anything, and unfortunately, nothing fun. Not only is this idea completely incredible, but it seems to indicate that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, instead of seeing this, go rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
