The author, Edgar Rice Burroughs and the filmmaker, are attempting against an Arab "Tarzan of the Apes". But, this movie in the desert shows none of the majesty present in the most successful adventure of the Burroughs jungle. The focus is on the love between the noble English nobleman Jon Hall (under the name "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (under the name "Princess" Eulilah). The opening indicates that, although guilty of improper conduct, the boy's mother is alive - but she never reappears. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated and it looks like it lacks images. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke and Ted Adams
