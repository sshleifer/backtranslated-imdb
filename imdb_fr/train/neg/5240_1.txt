As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms! But on behalf of its producers, I must say that this does not fit into any known film category, it deserves a brand new name! It's a "neurological drama"! It saddens and depresses every neuron in a person's brain. <br /> <br /> This is what happens closest to a stroke without experiencing one. This leaves you speechless, all your limbs become numb, your mouth stays open and the rest, and the strangest symptom is that you become blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> This is no small feat for a kind of "film". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind right after the end of my tests is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
