This movie is easily one of the worst I have ever seen. And I do not say it in a good way. We wanted to see a thriller / thriller shit, so we chose the one that seemed to be the ugliest store. For once, the movie was everything we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to read their lines on posters behind the camera. Special effects are created by placing clear transparent plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Do not even start me in the script ... And just when you thought it could not be worse, it turned out that the first part of the movie was an Oscar from the end . <br /> <If you like shitty horror movies, this movie is hilarious, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
