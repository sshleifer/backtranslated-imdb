I do not understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is awful, and that's no exception. If some of you have seen Ben Jones's quote that it is a "shady" waste, he is absolutely right. Why would they take a wonderful TV show, which I loved, who never missed an episode, and who have their own season 1-4 on DVD, and who ruin it, I'll never know. The TV show was a family show, and although Daisy had the body, it was really on display, even on the show, except the outfits. A family show has been turned into a dirty trash, and I would not recommend anyone to go see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are great actors (with the rest of the original cast) and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. It was one of the drawers of the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least have a brunette for Daisy. I also do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Hogg chef. Every other role he has played is totally opposed to this role. The only role they played mid-term is Willie Nelson in the role of Uncle Jesse, but it's still not comparable. Denver Pyle is an actor of his own, which made him perfect for the role. I think the cast is awful, the story is awful, and in total, ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty and terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to go see him. I only saw it out of curiosity, and there was a free ticket in Season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS FILM.
