In the first minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear, dreams of murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a newsstand and covets a studious young man he meets at the station. And he's the hero of that crazy movie that's all dressed up (except Krabbe in at least one scene too much) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged to nearly two hours before arriving at an unnecessary conclusion. Verhoeven has a beautiful visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, declared symbolism and free gore when he lacks ideas.
