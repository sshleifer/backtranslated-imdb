Peeew it stinks! As everyone knows, it's based on Geico insurance advertisements; what no one knows is WHY ?! These ads were fun at first; hardly fodder for a series. (The geico gecko speaking - that's another story, that would make an intriguing series!) And why then ABC - as reported in the press - did he really agree to buy the caveman character rights? to Geico for that? After all, the idea that cavemen are struggling in the modern world is hardly a television affair; Phil Hartman had a recurring role in Saturday Night Live as a lawyer for The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer more than 10 years ago. And this is how such a concept works best: on an ad hoc basis. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series titled "It's About Time" also uses cavemen in the concept of the modern world, it lasted one season.) <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the series, also Geico's advertising manager, was recently quoted: "We were so excited when we ran our commercials because we felt like we had something totally unique and we had bigger stories to tell." False. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad TV, he is destined to take his place alongside "Me and the chimpanzee" of 1972 as one of the worst of all time. The main actor of the embarrassing Chimp fiasco is actually hidden by association after being brutally canceled. No doubt our caveman friends will do the same.
