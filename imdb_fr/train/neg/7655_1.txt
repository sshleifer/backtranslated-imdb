We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He did the unthinkable. He is perhaps the only director to have two films among the last 100 on IMDb! It's like a kind of cinematic roach. Whatever his talent and his films, he manages to do them. I know, he's funding them all through some kind of weird German fund, but despite that, his ability to keep making movies despite total and absolute failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. <br /> <br /> would not be so bad, except that video game developers continue to give their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, allowed a few hours of play. There was a good movie to do with Edward Carnby's adventures, but that's not it. Now, Uwe Boll has got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: The Reckoning. And then, Silent Hill? Condemn? I can only imagine how this guy is going to make movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone has to withdraw their line of credit, or these video game publishers have to realize that when they make a bad movie with a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title anymore. <Br /> <br /> Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game? No way. A new House of the Dead game has just been released for X-Box and nobody cares. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So, if some of you are working for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher ... please let them know. <br /> <br /> This film itself does not even deserve to be watched. I can not separate what I did not like about this pile of dung from the rest. Literally, all that sucks. Writing, acting, music, synthesis effects, editing. I thought that if I waited for it to be released on DVD and then rent it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn a big pile of sholls into steam.
