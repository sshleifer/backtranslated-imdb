I anticipated the various science fiction and thriller films this summer, but I was very disappointed with this film. While some people were coming out of the movie, I decided to stay, only to laugh with the other spectators of acting, the lack of suspense, the ridiculous end and the difficult scenario to follow. I found myself almost as confused as the main character of the movie. The only reducing quality of the film was the soundtrack. It's one of those budding star movies that they later regret having done. In retrospect, I would not even rent this one, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see.
