I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw on TV. But the version put on DVD was a disaster. The lighting was weak to nonexistent and whole scenes were simply excised. In one case, Adele is going to bed and we immediately move to another scene - we enter the middle of a sentence - where it happens the next night. Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even presented, which leaves one wondering if they had slumbered for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyps. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the version of this movie you buy! We return this one.
