Londoners bored Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to travel. Their life becomes more exciting as they begin relationships with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But they are as boring as before. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, is probably bored, trying to animate Richie Shakespeare's film Rich and Strange (quoted in the movie, from "The Tempest") by ordering a few camera turns. A first tribute to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the culmination. The weak point can be the couple who dine on a cat prepared by Chinese people. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
