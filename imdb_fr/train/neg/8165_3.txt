It's a ghost story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a story of revenge. It's a very badly made film with a lot of violence. I guess it follows inexpensively along every slasher movie you've seen. He usually usually isolated, arrogant campers, heading to the desert. Certainly, there are scenes quite intense. It's so boring. Bad assembly and all the work. There are ghost children who seem to be talking in a wastebasket. I'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psychopath with the cork of the seed plays. There is also the raw scene where a man eats a piece of meat that is actually what is left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it was necessary to show this kind of free and sick violence. I fear this is just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is not an intelligence here, not a tongue in the cheek, only a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; little plot.
