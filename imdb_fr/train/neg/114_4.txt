It's not the cast. A finer group of actors you could not find. This is not the frame. The director is in love with New York and at the end of the film, we too! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you want to fall in love with love or find it, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There are not any. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are useless. This is what Hollywood directors have experienced when they go to work on the set. It's a reality for him and his peers, but it's a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film is hollow, superficial and without message.
