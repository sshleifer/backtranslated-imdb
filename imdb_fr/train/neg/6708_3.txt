Turn your back or you'll be in big trouble with the back of MY boyfriend! Only a happy ending can blossom your sad innocence just as you watch this. It is safe to say that the whole movie breaks up, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to the series of zombies that defy the nonsense to the fullest. We have a name like "Johnny" from time to time, and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no particular reason why our "dead corpse" comes out of his grave to survive until the prom night, making the film totally useless. Without difficulty, her mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny takes a mouthful of Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer is asked a difficult question: why should the film be this snowball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all living or dead persons is purely coincidental. "To live" is a coincidence. "Dead" is completely different from the movie. Show it to your girlfriend and she will skip the graduation party, turning your life into a desolate ruin. BLA bla!!!
