1/10 and it's only because my notes are not going down. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie of the "Trilogy", do not buy it or rent it. Believe me, you will not miss anything. the architect brings no new information: _ (spoiler) _ there was more NEO in front of him, it's like the number 6 or something. you can already find something like that in the first movie: Agent Smith telling us that the first matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity is dead and Neo's "love" has brought her back, where have I seen that before? Oh yes, in the first movie, the roles were reversed! same as the action scenes nothing new with more opponents. the action scene (the more than 20 ships) in the BIG battle we did not see (maybe in Revolutions?), betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted stab Neo?!) Button EGM see you soon. <br /> <br /> In short, an unscrupulous ploy to make money (especially with the guys who have gone to see him more than once), which obviously worked perfectly.
