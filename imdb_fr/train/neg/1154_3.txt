May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) make a seemingly uncommon visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the tour begins, Toots suffers a serious heart attack, leaving May adrift, uncertain, and questioning her life and future. Being attracted by her daughter's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), his actions have inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Nicely filmed, but despite the realism and applause he praises, The Mother offers a rather unpleasant collection, even repellent, and asks the viewer to interact with them. Reid shines as May and it's his talent and commitment as a wonderfully sober actor who save the film from a thoroughly depressing quagmire, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create characters as odious as ever hard to care about what may happen. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so selfish and so cold that one begins to wonder what Kureishi was trying to say. According to their instructions, they are reluctant or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensions in their abominable selfishness. <br /> <br /> To see for Reid's performance, but not much more. A crying shame ...
