Anyone who has written the "nice" post about it has to be a friend of these guys. It's bad even for the fight in the yard. In fact, it's not even really a fight in the yard, but some guys who hit on a trampoline. Each guy weighs about 45 lbs and there is not an ounce of entertainment value in that. These are just a few bored kids who even give the court a bad name, if that's possible. If you want to see a fun fight in your backyard, get Backyard Wrestling, a pleasure for the pain. It features the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have been there ever since and trained as "real" professional wrestlers. They went legitimate and improved. I recommend checking these 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and off the hook. So do not waste your time or money on this crappy DVD, there are "better" garden videos.
