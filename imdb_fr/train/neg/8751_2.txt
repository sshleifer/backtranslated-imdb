How can Disney get you? Preppy rich girls behave like idiots, buy a lot of stuff and get taught a lesson. Does Disney try to teach each other a lesson? What can be that while buying everything should always be human? Whatever the psychoanalysis, this film is null. <br /> <br /> Girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then the money disappears and they have to use their wealth for the milk factory (yes, milk) to be used by the workers. They keep it afloat until dad comes home. And the man at the beginning, who seems to be the one who takes the money, is the one. But the end is stupid. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? No longer worth my time. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "RE-"
