You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A sappy, trivial verse that will cost $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we see Ernie Borgnine, ninety years old, coming out of retirement to let us know that, in fact, he did not die as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul who married Ethel Merman many years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film, Ernie jumps feet first and represents the grandfather who has bonded with his lost grandfather. We have seen it before. You may like this movie but do not say you have not been warned.
