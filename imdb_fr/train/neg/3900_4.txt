As a person who has read the book, I can say that it is significantly inferior to the great American version interpreted by Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. First, Emma is too rude. Yes, she has faults and is not the easiest person to like - but the viewer should not start to despise her. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is a bad idea. His melancholy and melancholy in this version are more suited to an adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than Austen and boost the morale of the affair as a whole. Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to Harriet's role. and why was it made to look so sickly? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - so as not to feel as if she is carried away by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was muddy and scenes were cut off. In the end, when Emma decides that she likes Mr. Knightly, it seems completely disconcerting, because this story was not sufficiently shown and diffused throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly was happening with Mrs. Elton's accent? She began to look like an American actress who was trying to suppress her own early accent, then to all of America halfway, then to return to English in the end. Finally, it dragged on in the end. The book and the big-film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightly. This version hangs in confusion after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the end, a rather risky attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
