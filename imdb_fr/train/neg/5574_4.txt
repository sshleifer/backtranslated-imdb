"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" perfectly illustrates how a great idea can be ruined by such pathetic subjects as pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers of the future are trying to ruin Japan by replacing local hero Godzilla with their monster puppy, the three-headed dragon, King Ghidorah. They fail, however, and in the end, Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two giants are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and everything about "Japan is awesome" is really stupid. The creators of this film have not even threatened the enemies of Japan, making them fat stupid blond guys, who are easily fooled by the intelligent Japanese. The good thing is that in the end, Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed Japan and its ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular fights. But until this royal battle, the movie was really dull and pathetic.
