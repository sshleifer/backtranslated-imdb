Even old even old about Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's real character. Sodeberg has redone the same boring story of Che. The seductive and seductive tale of a rich Argentinian so shocked by poverty that he became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor until his final assassination by the CIA. Yeah, yeah, everything heard before, BORING AND UNTRUE! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was totalitarian with a messianic trail and that he openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that at the height of the Cold War, he had even urged the Soviet Union to destroy the nuclear weapon of New York, Washington or Los Angeles and end the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he said that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev collapsed and literally saved the world, Che was furious at the "treason". If Che's recommendations had been followed, you would not read this article now. How a deadly maniac became an icon of pop would have made a much more interesting movie. Incredible that no filmmaker had the audacity to show the true side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. THAT MAKES A WINNING FILM TO THE Oscar! I thought that doing an independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being AWESOME! They stick to only "safe counter-culture themes", namely "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "The NRA is worse that the KGB "," Christians are fanatics and stupid. ", etc. ... ad nauseum. Oooh, what audacity, what a breath. Very anti-mainstream and edgy. I wish they had real cojones and attack the oligarchy of independent film! It would be really bold!
