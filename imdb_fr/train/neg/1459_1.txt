This is by far one of the most boring and horrible stories of the early days of Adolf Hitler I have seen. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but calling him Hitler is simply wrong. To make Liev Schrieber the longtime friend and Hitler's help, Haefengstal had to make cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, a bad cast. It was not a nice family film with a good historical background. It was the most beautiful garbage Hollywood, taking advantage of the presence of a host of actors (who have been cruelly underused) that seemed to have virtually disappeared from the radar of the actors in the past five years. <br /> <br /> The false German accents (vee vill vin zis var) insult the German people everywhere. My mother is German and she gaped at the sound of voices that were constantly changing American / English / German in the same sentence. Secondary actors make better cuts of cardboard in the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone, in the role of Geli Raubal, was beautiful, but she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who finally ended her life to escape what her future would have been in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want an extremely fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years that preceded and included the war / holocaust, praise "Inside the Third Reich" (1983) with Rutger Hauer in the role of Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi in the role of Hitler. It was good and it made more sense then this baloney. <br /> <br /> As a researcher in the history of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that I had been able to take my books to confirm his innumerable inaccuracies.
