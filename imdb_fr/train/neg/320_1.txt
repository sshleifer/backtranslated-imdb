With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic movies ever made. This is the cruise ship server Shecky (Sandler) who wants to become a comedian on the cruise ship. First of all, honestly, there is not a funny or clever phrase throughout the movie. It's so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Surprisingly, there is not much raw or sexual humor, but the word-f is plentiful. The budget is very low and it ruins the film. This is happening on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent a small boat and money for 10 additional extras, including Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated cheaply, and it's pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone who sees it will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 min. ranked R for Language.
