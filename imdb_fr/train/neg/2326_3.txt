Dr. Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend to any adult or child to see this unless they already unleash the murderers. There is so much dirt in this movie that it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, on a background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined something so bad. I rented every copy I could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5-pound crucifix. This film should stay locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. This is where this movie belongs. If you want outrageous entertainment, I recommend renting All Go Go Go Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and you like terrible movies, you have to see Dr. Mordrid.
