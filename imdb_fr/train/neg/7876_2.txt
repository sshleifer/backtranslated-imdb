At a round table I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers said that it should not be seen as a film but as a provocative of thoughts. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked to me were the time wasted watching the movie. The film's gimmicks (documentary style, futuristic setting) distracted what needed to be a thorough examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political opinions - it's usually a very boring film that preaches to the choir.
