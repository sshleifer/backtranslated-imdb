It was Jon Pertwee who said: "It is very difficult to be funny but very easy to be stupid". Well, if that's the case, PASTY FACES is "very easy". David Baker (as director / screenwriter) and his actors seem to have the impression that the comedy consists of stealing scenes and styles from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped scenario and by jumping up and down. very loud voice. Alan McCaffrey particularly suffers from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to ruin the film because there is not enough film to ruin it. <br /> <br /> The appearance FACE is very bad on all fronts, especially in the scenarios. I did not understand why it stopped like this, it was like stopping abruptly and stupidly. Oh, and other blatant mistakes, you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work on it. This movie would make you think that you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without permission. I'm still being paid to give blood in America - people I know in America who donate blood tell me that payment for donations stopped years ago - and you can buy any type of blood weapon in a weapons store. As far as I know, US firearms laws differ from state to state, but no arms store sells anti-tank weapons over-the-counter. So we have a very mistaken view of America from a very unreal and funny film. Maybe this is a revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood-like view of Scots? Maybe, but that does not stop PASTY FACES from being a shitty comedy
