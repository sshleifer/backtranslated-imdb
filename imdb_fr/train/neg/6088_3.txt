Why do I watch movies like this? - Apart from my bizarre masochistic belief and lost one day, I will find a real jewel among all these slags, I can not think a good reason. This film was dirt from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dirt. Where else than in a bad Italian film could we find passionate exchanges of mutilated surrealist English like this between an honest military guy and the sinister leader of a secret X-file, an organization dedicated to the concealment of "The truth": <br /> <br /> Man in black: Silence is better for us until we can prove that UFOs have no bellicose motive. <br /> <br /> Military Type: In any case, I find your interference unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The man in black: The one who must impose his will is. <br /> <br /> I rewound the DVD (you see what I mean) a good half dozen times and I still can not do these lines means anything unreasonable. My other favorite line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be tough on those who violate our interests." <br /> <br /> This is English Jim, but not as we know him. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this monotonous film were for me the completely offbeat role of the photographer's character at the beginning. Affected by the worst haircut of all time, the man walked around, looking like a stunned fish wearing a bad wig, until he was kidnapped and forced to watch a piece of Plexiglas from some extraterrestrials . In most cases, the aliens are not perceived as a POV shooting - portable camera with "fish-eye" lens - a kind of goose bumps the first time, but, used again and again, it has lost its power (incidentally, if it is a shot in point of view, it means that the extraterrestrials always come out of the rooms in the back for some reason). <br /> <br /> The film was shot in "England". This meant that Italian-Spanish scenographers had placed British license plates on some English cars and a Union Jack on our hero's press card ... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not notice the characters they were composing (is there such a word?) No longer walked on gravel, but were now on the lawn, so their feet would not stop to make some noise "Crunch! Crunch!" noises. Other than that, another total loss of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they will prove that these UFOs will soon have no bellicose motives ...
