Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and new baby. The problem is that they do not exist - Ollie apparently invented them! It is therefore up to him and his boyfriend to find a woman with a baby who will accept to pretend to be his family. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this story is not particularly unique, as I have already seen at least. a couple of other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was DO NOT MAKE ME Bobby Vernon. It's much better than ONE TOO MANY - probably largely because of its production ten years later - when the comedy became a little more sophisticated and less based on useless slapstick. Now, I'm not against physical comedy, but in some wacky movies, people start shooting guns savagely, kicking and strangling, and so on. with little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. It makes no sense and it was as if they lacked story ideas. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not really an important step in the entertainment field. There is simply not enough reward to deserve to be watched unless you are a silent and obsessive fan like me.
