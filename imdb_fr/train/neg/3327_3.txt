Two sisters, their evil brother and their cousin have car problems. They then occur around the home of Dr. Hackenstein, who needs the body parts of three nubile young women to be used in an experiment to bring back his deceased lover to life. He tells them that he will help them go home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor gets to work in this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this slightly fun, nothing that really hurt you (I came across Netflix Instant View & streamed it on the Xbox 360), but I was expecting better whether for a film acquired by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but there are still elements that made me smile. Anne Ramsey has a small role and she has always been a treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Bambi Darro and Sylvia Lee Baker had naked breasts <br /> <br /> My note: D +
