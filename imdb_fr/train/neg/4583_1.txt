If you want to attend a clever philosophical discussion about human possibilities and potentials, take a look at "Waking Life," which is great. "What the # $ *! Do We Know" is omnipresent in its theme, misdirected, poorly written, misinterpreted, totally devoid of any artistic direction and completely boring. It was not at all thought-provoking or entertaining. The inclusion of this rambling phenomenon "Ramtha" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Is not it odd to see how filmmakers choose to look beyond the fact that this woman worships a 2000 year old Atlantic god or something? What flake this old chick is, and what a waste of time and money this movie has been. The people responsible for this film should no longer be allowed to make another film.
