The writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer had a profound influence on my life as a Christian and I looked forward to watching this film and learning more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was disjointed ... it gave no background on his life, no historical context and nothing on his great writings (except a brief and transient reference to the film "The cost of the disciple" by a colleague at the beginning of the film. Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the United States) and relaxing with his friends before deciding to return to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he gets up for his faith. Instead of stressing this, we have a very bad relationship with a 17 year old schoolgirl. Whether it really happened or not, it should not have been an important part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or a narration explaining what his writings were ... or SOMETHING to let us know a little about the greatness of this man. drum roll ..... waiting ..... ..... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of film that gives a bad name to "Christian Films". All they had to do was set up a structure to follow for the film, with some antecedents ... even voice-overs or flashbacks preaching him of his works ... a narrative on which he was where he had been. But no ... that's what we got. Not suitable for a hero of faith.
