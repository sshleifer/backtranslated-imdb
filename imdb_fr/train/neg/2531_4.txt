The title track of this movie ........... is the biggest free and spiritual ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time in 1978-1979 when I subscribed to cable. In 1979, cable was just starting to become a common place in homes. (or at least, when it became general here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> It could very well be the first movie I ever watched on the paid channel called "The Movie Channel" - which was called "The Star Channel" at the time, they changed the name of "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ........ I received a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the movies in strong rotation on this network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie at the time, thinking it was a typical teen movie (in the same vein as other teen movies medium budget) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I totally forgot that this movie existed even until I saw it recently after having not seen it since. decades (I found a copy on DVD on sale at cheap bin). I recognized it and bought it for $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> Looks like I remembered that this movie was a lot better than it was. However, looking at it at the time was a different experience than it is now (more than 30 years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to see the list of kids listening to rock music, smoking grass and having sex in the back an elegant van (often all at once). That's what a good party movie for teens is. <br /> <br /> The plot is nothing more than the fact that the main character dreams of making love with his great rival, his beautiful girlfriend ... He spends all his savings money - studies to buy a deceived Dodge Van (with long-pile carpeted walls, a mirrored ceiling and a waterbed in it) to get his attention, and he ends up having sex with her. But his great rival discovers and comes looking for him (so that both can settle their differences by dragging their vans) ... he and his great rival end up destroying their two vans and instead of flying away. his rival girlfriend, he wins the heart of a girl (unattractive) that he attended most of the time and he decides he is happier / better and that the film ends. <br /> <br /> the film has its funny moments. But watching this movie more than 30 years later, it becomes more of a trip to the past. Because I still remember pizzerias, pinball arcades, it also reminded me of memories of cruises in a small town while we smoked pot, as we screamed pretty girls and hoped to fuck me (sometimes I I was lucky and I remember a lot of songs from this movement (when they were new) ...... this film is a perfect time capsule for that era in these respects (brought back full of memories) <br /> <br /> The only thing described in this movie that I really do not remember is .... I never remember the days when the vans were so big I remember that very well At the time, I do not remember young men who want to have a van, I remember younger men of the 70s (including those looking for a Trans Am, Chevy pontiac.) Camaro or a Ford Mustang , but never a van, this film gives the impression that The pickups are the most popular item. and that every young man wanted one (which was not the case at the time)
