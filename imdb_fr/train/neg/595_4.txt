Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's about all for this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no scenario. No nice character, well, "characters" is not correct if you consider that nobody really knows it. I mean, they're being chased by a weird-looking "thing" in the sewers (who's that thing, why is he here?), That's pretty scary I suppose, but am I really care? No I do not. Why I do not Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I should want them to live or die. It's one-dimensional and uses sound effects and gores to scare you, which is rarely the case. <br /> <br /> This film is meaningless. I feel as though I have fallen asleep and missed the 45 minutes of preparation. He jumps directly into action. Basically, women and her friends find themselves locked in the London Underground, are pursued by a strange creature, then escape. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds ok, but that's not what makes a decent horror movie, so unfortunately, all that is wasted. <br /> <br /> This is not new. Another predictable modern "horror", where Kate (the main character) is always stupid "hey, I know a lot of people sitting at home think I should do what makes sense in this situation, but oooh no! I'm going to do the opposite because I'm a stupid blond "thing. I wish they did not do it, it's done so many times, it's boring and becomes predictable. In fact, I am rather bored that the silly woman did not get stabbed by this grizzly creature with an extraterrestrial appearance. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the slogan of the film. Well, Creeps' journey ends only a short time in the movie. If you have had a few beers, if you have a few friends back, then watch it well. But if you want something original and smart, avoid it.
