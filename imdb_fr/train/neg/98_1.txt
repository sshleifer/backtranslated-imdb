I received this film as a gift, I knew it thanks to the jacket of the DVD, this film will be bad. After not looking at him for over a year, I finally watched him. what pathetic film? <br /> <br /> I have almost finished watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair of me to write a review without looking at the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie is bad" I'm really shocked that a certain filmmaker who lost his money was even funded to make this pathetic film. But it could not have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce it. All you need is a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera. About 15 people without any skills at stake, a scenario written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this very bad movement, a journalist (Tara Woodley) leads a supposed drunk man on the way to reporting on a tracked city. He is completely unscathed. They went to a house that was supposed to be abandoned, but fortunately for the almost complete furnished and a bottle of alcohol on the doorstep happened to be there. For the supposedly drunk man but everything is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> The supposedly drunk man then begins to tell stories to ghost Tara / zombies. <br /> <br /> The fist of his fool The lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Its history <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die of total exhaustion (I think that's what happens) after letting private soldier Wilson sit down, let him dig a grave, and then the soldier collapsed, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> buries him in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is for a big surprise. his fianc√©e, wife or daughter, knows about it and she and her lover kill the Sgt. Ben Draper takes revenge on Private Wilson (next to the grave of the soldier he murdered) The soldier comes out of his grave in the form of a zombie and kills him for taking revenge on his part. <br /> <br /> The end of twist was so bad. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
