The guys from MST3K should see this dog from a movie. It is essentially a Hollywood actor dopey who can not win any concert. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this idiot actor do? He dyes his hair blond and begins to behave like a surfer guy in the naive hope that it will give him acting roles. You'll laugh at so many fun scenes inadvertently from this movie. As when the girlfriend of the actor's guy is heartbroken, she sobs and says phrases like, "How can you do this to me?" And why is she crying? Because he dyed his hair blond and became a type of surfer to get acting concerts. This film does not make sense at all! The actor who played the governor on Benson is also involved and plays the role of a stereotypical right-wing politician with a stupid and funny dialogue. This movie will make you crack, believe me. You are speaking to me?!
