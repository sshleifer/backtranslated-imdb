Maybe it's not fair, because I only did it about halfway through the movie. One of the few movies I could not watch because of lameness. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the work of the camera is horrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and old-fashioned. For example, during a transaction, the coca is kept in a briefcase. I'm not an expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect. Every time a punch is thrown (it's that "crunching" sound on the top "and they use toy guns with doubled sound effects. <br /> <br /> Worse film ever.
