Boy, it was an ugly movie! Although I have not seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can say with certainty that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean region, governing an insulting stick when she is suddenly visited by this poet traveler, mouth. In fact, the whole film is just a speech, a lot of the speech makes no sense. Even in 1968, no one could imagine this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. Without the beautiful cinematography and the beautiful scenery, it deserves a negative note. The only thing this film is good for is its involuntary laughter at the expense of the stars.
