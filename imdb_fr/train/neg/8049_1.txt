A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. Undertow is useless and uncompromising, and has often made me think of a Twain sentence that all characters are drowned together. When someone brings up the category of the worst films ever made, it's not like Plan 9 or Killer Shrews Attack I think; it's like that. What a total waste of time - mine and all those who participated in this film.
