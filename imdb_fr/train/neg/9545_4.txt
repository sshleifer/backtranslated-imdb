Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game simulating a terrorist attack. Ripley, the super-government computer designed to profile potential terrorists, follows him as Will borrows (by pirating) money from his neighbor's neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia. . The next-door neighbor who Will was repairing the computer has parents in the Mid-East who, via their bank, send money to the neighbor's bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to trigger missile strikes. Oh oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster pace and aggression than the War Games movie of the early 1980s. Well, the electronics industry has much more to do with these days. Logic. So the movie dazzles us with a fantastic computer-generated image, and once Joshua, Ripley's forerunner, becomes operational, we just have to watch a computer against a computer and the humans are shaking, hoping, pray ... somehow, oh ... oh-ing, OMG-ing, and even more hopeful that everything will be fine. In other words, we're currently watching a TV movie, and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie. It's much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: do we make computers too smart where, one day, they will govern us? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nudity: No Language: No
