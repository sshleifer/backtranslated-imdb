Oh, I heard so much about this movie. I went to see this with my best friend (she is a woman, I am a man). Now, please allow me a different opinion from the general public. After the first two dozen "take off your clothes," we both felt a strange combination of foolishness and boredom. We laughed (we did not have fun with her), we went to sleep (and we had better stay in bed), we were convinced that we had spent money in vain. And we had. The plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people that could not be cared for. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This film does not even deserve a vote out of ten, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this film has the reputation of being excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who even has a minimum of taste or intelligence.
