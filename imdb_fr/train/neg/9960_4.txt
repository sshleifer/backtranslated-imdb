MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an episode of sexual abuse committed by a man of trustful neighbor, the young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) she meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has its own secrets, no less disturbing and much more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dramatic drama, inspired by the brave performances of Harrison and Whishaw, in which two related spirits immerse themselves in mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship disappears as harsh reality begins to intrude, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the film seems to be in tatters (too much awkward close-ups and slow camera movements) and takes a while to find its mark, but the spectacular gain is rewarding.
