First a technical examination. The scenario is so slow, it's really a 25-minute story, swollen at one-thirty. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "game" is pathetic, they seem to have really pushed school kids out of the classroom to read a few lines of an idiot board. As for all the "point" of the story, namely that "the war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) Is really non-existent. Without the "let them shock and advertise" scene, no one would talk about this movie. It's so bad that it really bothers me to think about the best things the money used could have yielded. Believe me, I've seen bad movies about the "new clothes of the emperor", but I can tell for them that they have at least been well shot and well done while the camera flickered during two scenes! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
