I do not know about you, but what I like in Tom and Jerry's cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leave Tom for an adventure in New York and, in my opinion, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat! <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry's exploration by 'Big Apple' could be aimed at other T & J fans who commented here on IMDb, I could not wait for this indulgent garbage to end to be able to watch the next drawing on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of this episode that I really liked was when Jerry almost "bought the farm", hanging on the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet over a busy road.
