Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to try my luck with Murder By Numbers. Although decent in brave and self-effacing roles, Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 days) leaves much to be desired. Her character is at once omniscient, confused, and sexually inappropriate (the sub-intrigue of Sandra's past appears as an unnecessary filling material that hardly develops its already superficial character). Both teenagers performed well, although their expertise in forensic science and their catch-me-if-can attitude were belied by stupid mistakes that shouted "We did it!" Chris Penn as a too obvious suspect is wasted here, as is the character of Ben Chaplin, privileged partner / lover of love. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Poor, the biggest flaws may be is related to a televised plot of the week that never fully instilled the motives for the murder, and as mentioned, the stupid mistakes (vomiting a rare food on the scene of the murder, a too convenient and framing school janitor, the two boys who meet in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc., etc. pass the sight of intrigues to the boredom and disappointment of the murderers.The end was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film.Using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the culminating scene At the beginning of the film, then explain to the public how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lack the so-called intelligence that the film claims to reach its conclusion. but poorly executed and weak in almost every respect. * out of ****.
