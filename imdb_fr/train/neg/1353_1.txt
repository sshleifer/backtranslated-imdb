What is it? is a mix of weird recurring patterns (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and overtly racist music, among others), without any sort of narrative, intrigue or character development. It all seemed to me like a "monster show" consciously and I'm not just talking about unusual casting decisions. It sounds like a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use that could be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie of all time), which was intentionally much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total loss of my time. It's one thing to take a look at the workings of someone else's mind - even someone else's chemically impaired consciousness - but another to throw me strange pictures only for strange reasons.
