Sweet SPOILERS contained in this document. I spoil this film to avoid the trouble of watching it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's films fall into one of two categories: Shaolin-era films and today's Hong Kong-themed films that revolve around Triads or organizations similar to Triad. Every genre has its best and worst movies. "Twin Warriors" is the best film of the Jet Li Shaolin era, while "The Evil Cult" is its worst. "Fist of Legend" is the best Jet Li movie of "the modern era" in the recent past. `Black Mask 'is without a doubt the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays the role of an exiled mercenary who has been given an injection that gives him superhuman abilities, but shortens his life. In his "new life" in exile, he plays the role of pacifist librarian. When his old team of mercenaries goes wild, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He puts on a very ridiculous corrugated mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, as well as to hide his true identity from his ex-comrades. <br /> <br /> the version I saw was dubbed, and horribly to that. Why is Jet Li hijacking his library colleague if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does the chief of police not care when he learns the true identity of the black mask? The plot is simply BAD. Bad because of the cheesiness of superheroes, bad in that the characters are never well developed, bad in their interactions of character, all topped with a half-explained story to which I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> The action and martial arts sequences are well above. A lot of blood, gore (explosions and cut parts of the body), explosions and martial art fiascos in the Matrix style are present in the film. Unfortunately, it's the best and the only point of sale for movies. If you want to see Jet Li play the role of a superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie, entitled "Black Mask". For the rest of us, Jet Li fans, it's a real disappointment. This is one of those films where Jet Li never became Jet Li: he has neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor to impress us with his impressive and realistic martial arts talent. <br /> <br /> Normally, a Chinese imitation of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to captivate me in a movie. Unfortunately, "Black Mask" has proved to be an exception to this rule. Indeed, the antagonist of this film, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair and his round sunglasses look like the Ozzy Osbourne, a modern and elderly man. However, the villain is not on the screen long enough for the gadget is worth it. I suppose the resemblance to Ozzy was intentional; in addition to the look of the wicked, he also held a satanic hiding place. Ozzy Osbourne's villain gimmick could have done a lot more! If only the writer, the director or any other person had taken the trouble to give the context and develop the character of the villain of the film! <br /> <br /> "Black Mask" is the first Jet Li movie released on video in the US after Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I did not leave it until now. This may have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at its worst, praise `Black Mask 'and` The Evil Cult' and make it a double haul of horror, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, respect the movements that use Jet Li's talents and dispose of semi-well-thought-out and plausible parcels. 3/9 stars.
