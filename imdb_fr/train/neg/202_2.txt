This is not the sound of bees, it is the effect induced by watching this extremely long film, extremely boring and badly played. I'll never know how I got through the 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep. The plot is simple ... 3 absolutely incompatible idiots talk about sex for 3 hours and a half. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. It's even worse, if it's possible. > I really have to be a masochist if I could watch all that film without turning it off ... or killing someone.
