This dirt is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is nil, the quality of the image goes from bad to worse in good bad! Things happen for no apparent reason, the characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from a serious brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Poor filming aside, the story is horrible, sick of harm if you love rape, murder and self harm, c alley. And if simulated murder scenes are not enough, you can watch excerpts of people executed. I watched almost everything, but I had to turn off after seeing someone's brain blew. Never before have I seen a film that left me so shameful and dirty.
