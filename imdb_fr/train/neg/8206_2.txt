With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I was expecting this film to be at least tolerable. It was not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with the remote in my hand so that the fast forward was ready. So ordinary, so standard, we know what will happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word by word. It's one of those movies that hurts and that says, "How was this movie done?" In an effort to say something positive, I will add that there are some slightly entertaining special effects. But overall, if you've seen 5 sci-fi movies, or if you're over 9, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
