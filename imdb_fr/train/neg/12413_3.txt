I will not say that this movie is horrible because I have seen worse, but it's not even half-decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really understand what was going on and where things were going. When the movie was finished, I let myself scratch my head. I watched until the end of the credits to see if they had anything that could clear things up, but once the credits were over, it was over. I felt as if I was upset from one point of the weak plot to another throughout the movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> The development of the characters is very superficial. I could not understand when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, smashed, mentally challenged, or if they just had a bad actor to represent them. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (it's hard not to use them when making a movie about a singer in a rock band), which SHOULD facilitate character development, so many movies have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to escape. Stereotypes are easy to describe, which would explain why so many bad movies tend to misuse stereotypical characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotyped characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem of the characters is that they seemed to have been dismissed without explanation. I guess it's okay because I spent so little time developing characters that I really did not get to know any of them, so I never really missed any of them them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least Sadie sang. It's horrible. The music that accompanies it is not winning, but it is usually drowned in the cries that come out of the vocal cords of Sadie. I swear there is a moment in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I should turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. The characters are poorly developed, the Georgia game is wooden and stiff, the character of Sadie is moved from one bad situation to another, without history or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I do not see any good reason to see this film unless I'm thirsty for cinematic pain.
