It must be one of the worst directions I've seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene is made up of close-ups, it loses its full impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful landscapes, the sets of Mexico City, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives and the dusty cities that Costner goes through on his journey of revenge. Unfortunately, we can only see these places quickly before the camera takes the image of a big giant head. Even the transitional scenes where Costner drives alone across Mexico quickly drew closer. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating all the emotions we should feel. The story itself should have been much better managed. Among other things, too many people come out of nowhere to help Costner, it's bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical thriller story, but many others have taken the same principle and made some remarkable things. Costner No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The end was completely anticlimatic and suffered from the most melodramatic score of the film. This film would never have been great, but if we had seen more Mexico and less giant heads, this film could have been viewed.
