First film directed by D.W. Griffith; it features a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the king leaves the stage, his queen makes music with the palace minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to trigger a horrible revenge of the Edgar Allen Poe type. It is hard to believe that lovers do not hear those who plot against them. although the actors try to appear in turn noisy (the lovers) and silent (the concrete mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" very staged. The performances are correct and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D. W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
