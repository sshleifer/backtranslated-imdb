Massacre Vulpine should have been this real title of the movie. And the slogan should have read "Guaranteed to make your children cry!" It's a drama of nature telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote area. Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes, then by the birth of a large family and the trials of their breeding. The only thing that speaks is made in the narration by a tree that stands over the den, giving a glimpse of loves and animal life ... Beautiful landscapes and a beautiful shoot of animals. Sounds good eh? From there, things go straight to hell and then start drilling to the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Below - Or it can be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost first, we learn that one of the foxes was born blind. But he seems to get along well and there is a beautiful musical score to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the adventures of the siblings. And then he dies ... One of the sisters goes on screen ... and then she dies ... And that's it, it looks like a horrible horror movie: one fox after another is killed by nature, in traps, just and disappear, and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! At the end of the film, almost all the foxes were slaughtered. Fortunately, no deaths are displayed on the screen. (At least not in the version we saw.) Contrary to saying "Tarka the Otter", the deaths in this film are almost all useless and border the sadism in the way the hopes are built and go out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It's a nature film after all. But not almost the whole family. <br /> <br /> Do not go and see this movie deceived by the happy box thinking it's a safe for kids. Observe with some idea that things are not going well and that you or your children may feel very bad about your sensitivity or sensitivity. You can enjoy it. Or you can not ...
