Have you ever had a good idea that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: like seeing a detective looking through the cracks in a broken fence of an abandoned house? Or see a woman walking down a street, cold, intense and terribly alert? Yeah. Imagine that you were stretching this image on a whole movie, you almost had the idea of ​​Broken, although there is no detective in this film, I use it only as a visual example. But, the woman with the intense look is here and she occupied about 99% of the time spent in front of a screen. I have nothing to reproach this woman, she is a perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open minded person who can find pleasure in all kinds of artistic expressions and I can really enjoy it really morose thing. It would be really nice if I could frame one of the scenes in this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors' faces are what makes me look. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the problem of this film. Beyond the atmosphere, there is not much else here. The director was obsessed with an idea and far exceeded it. I do not consider it to be a spoiler if I say that the obsession is "mirror". Let's face it, this singular idea is ubiquitous and that's all the director needs to work with. Certainly, there are some twists and turns here and there. If you pay attention, nothing will surprise you at the end, apart from obvious closet holes. <br /> <br /> Now, I do not bones with this style of art, I enjoyed it most of the time. . I still believe that we should judge a basic art on the medium it uses to express what the artists want to express. The film is not a piece of music, nor an image, nor a painting, nor even a poem, and certainly not just a cool picture in your mind. That's all, plus a good story and character development. I consider Lynch's movie style cheating. It's irresponsible and inexpensive and a waste of support. We gave movies for 2 hours for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge differently than judging a single image, such as a photograph or a painting. <br /> <br /> This film is not quite in Lynch's style, thank God. It had a linear development and finally came to a conclusion. He does not have a lot of history or character development. He introduced himself rather seriously with characters composed of ordinary people, thus standing out from other elements of fantasy at least from the surface. He offers no explanation of the fantasy element and has never tried to build a coherent world around him. The quirk comes from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Consistency may remain in the director's mind, but from what I can see, he has not put much effort into making it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did he put his effort then? He seems to have put a lot of effort into creating the mood and improving it with the music. The music often accumulates tensions that end up turning into teasing. It was only in the last part of the film that fear and tension materialized. <br /> <br /> Finally, I said to myself: OK, I know what you're trying to say here, but is it the goal to spend two hours accumulating all these tensions? It does not matter who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are told very little of who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that has just taken place. Disappointing but I guess the director did not have much material with which to work and it shows.
