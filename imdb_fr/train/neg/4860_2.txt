Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program overwhelms me. It's really bad! Of course, I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I spoke exclusively of these seasons, this show would have had eight stars out of ten. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons that were not part of the original cast are good. They were and are terrible. Comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL!!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was filled with very talented comedians, like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name), all of whom should have had better deals after leaving MAD TV. This show is highly overrated and less worthy of your navigation time on the channel than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV fade and die, as it should.
