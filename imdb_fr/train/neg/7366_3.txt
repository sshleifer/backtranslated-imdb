What was the F * @ # I just watched? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is insatiably bad and silly. In a strange departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal now fights (obviously) to wish to be a vampire "like" creatures with superhuman strength. "Okay, oh, and their eyes are flashing in an inhuman way, Hou la la!" Even in this film, however, to repress Seagals, he's kind of stronger than them, but all ordinary humans are crushed around him, come on, I can understand the bully or the drug dealer in the neighborhood, but they are beings of superhuman strength Oh, and understand that, Seagal is going through a brief identity crisis, because apparently he and his cohorts in the movie think he's Wolverine! Oh My GO ... And worse than all that! Yes, it's worse than that. He has a voice even changing mid-sentence while we watch He obviously does not sound like him, and I think it could be one of the other actors in the film, it was pure madness, and although I want to turn it off, I always watch a movie to finish. It's an absolute record, even for your direct movies, Steven Terrible Terrible! down! Redefining qualities? Well, I guess so, I'll be right in that aspect. At least some special effects were acceptable and I like the choice of the wardrobe for actors and actresses. The women were all very attractive to the IMO. Still, and I said ENCORE, that does not make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here), rip it off! The director, screenwriter, producer, ALL should be banned and exiled from the film industry. I think I feel what most people think of Blood Rayne (and almost all of Uwe Boll's other pictures) about this movie. It's all my dollar on this movie. See if you dare.
