I thought of Harvey Keitel, a young Sex Pistols student John Lydon, and then, as a bonus, Ennio Morricone's music. I was expecting an old-school, edgy, Italian cop thriller that was made in America. In mind, I have a story of hodgepodge that has never made sense and a film that let me say: WTF! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic was thrown into the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring these guys together with a better script. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a waste of time, but not a "must see", unless you're an outspoken fan of Keitel.
