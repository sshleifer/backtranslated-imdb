I really do not understand all these positive comments. This film is the worst film I have ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's his fault, but the administrators. He managed to make everything artificial. their acting, the idea, the makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star that I give is only for the idea behind the film, which was very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or a certain David Lynch.
