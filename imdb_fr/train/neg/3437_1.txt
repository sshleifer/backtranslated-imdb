I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit it was not my cup of tea. Although this is supposed to be a horror film of its kind. But while I was watching this, I thought ... 'This film does not make sense.' Where did this guy in black coat come from? Where were the two guys going when they left the girls behind? Where did a shark come out? <br /> <br /> All these elements of this film have not been completed. I felt like these filmmakers were wasting a lot of time and money on a movie that was so much about shit. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of good horror movies in my day, but most of the worst horror movies I've seen. At the end of the movie, I thought I would not look at it anymore. So many pappy shows in this movie, I decided to abandon it! Count me on this one! 0 out of 10!
