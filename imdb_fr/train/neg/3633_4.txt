Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most likeable, but in this scenario, the audience is well ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares into the void, visibly hypnotized, and says something like, "I must go up and be killed," I felt it was silly that no one resumed after being killed. The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would! After the hated horse owner, Gene Lockhart, is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, saying that she is going to get killed, then fatally jumps off a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted "I got it", as if it was a revelation. The culprit, however, was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense as he began to hypnotize Lowe to make him jump from a roof.
