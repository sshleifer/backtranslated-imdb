Sarah Silverman is really the comic book "flavor of the month" right now. Is she really all the hype? Yes and no. She's sometimes funny, sometimes hilarious (her stand-up practice is actually quite interesting, though she's not always funny). Other times, you feel cheated by the media because they have listened too much to another artist. She is one of those really cute comedians, to whom men are particularly devoted, claiming that they are deepening her intelligence and mind. But if you block them, most men will admit that they only want to sleep with her and that's why they watch her. It reminds me why many men have gathered around Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are really "exciting" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigarettes), so she should be hot at 60 so that her fans (especially men) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> For this show, it's a lot like his comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When this is not the case, it is a total boredom and very, very boring. The episode of AIDS here is the best. It's always funny and contains a very good satire. The character of Brian Poeshn has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in an episode and it's hilarious to see him in a Tab t-shirt. But they never really go anywhere with it, and he ends up exhausting his welcome. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another guy) seems to be stuck and never does anything for the series as a whole, and support players (including Sarah's real sister , Laura not look like her) are OK. When the jokes hit, they are brilliant. When they do not do it, they are awful, and I mean really awful. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (shit jokes), which seems to have replaced the current wit and intelligence in comedy. So should you watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, go ahead. You can watch it and act as if it were yours. As for its emission, it goes from zero to absolute zero.
