I am surprised that anyone who participates in the production of this series recognizes its responsibility. The scenario is so funny that it must have been written by someone who failed the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union entrance exam (and that says a lot!). Take out your binoculars if you want, but nothing looks like a joke. Ronnie Corbett must have been completely broke to humble himself with this garbage. The rest of the cast lacks so much acting or comedy talent that I'm surprised it lasted after the first episode - correction, after the auditions. All I can say to those who have fun is that they must be very easily entertained. And obviously the production costs had to be 100 per episode. And just in case someone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner who does not know English humor, I must add that I'm really English.
