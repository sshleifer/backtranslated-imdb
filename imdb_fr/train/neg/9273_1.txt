The first question that comes to mind after looking at this garbage is who gave these idiots the right to use the name of Omen in this movie? It is a ridiculous, embarrassing and pathetic attempt to pursue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the background music sounds as if it came straight from a cartoon of Bugs Bunny and from that moment, the movie gets worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they had an E - for that when they took it back to show their teacher! After a while, it's hard to tell if it's a comedy. Indeed, what happens is so funny and so little faithful to the original omen that it arouses conviction. The acting is laughable, especially on the part of the main woman Faye Grant. she continues to make funny faces or has she a hard time not to laugh? It's hard to say. The worst sequel I have ever had the misfortune to see. 1 out of 10
