Connie Hoffman is very pretty and sometimes has an attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's all. The only reason we wonder if we want to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These parts of the sexploitation period of the 70s are sometimes fun because of their dating (flared trousers, big hair, zapata mustaches, etc.). This one is not. <br /> <br /> The scenario is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a romantic romantic head man is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title, alluding to a sex comedy, is extremely misleading. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding this one as the plague.
