In fact, it was pretty funny ... in a "god, how did this movie get", sort of. if you make fun of movies ... what I do a little ... go ahead, look at it ... but if you really think "is this a good movie?" eff off. <br /> <br /> This film has been bad since the beginning, with the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie .... usually they spend five minutes there before realizing that " this film could be nil "" .. but no, you know right now, this film is about Edgar Allen Poe ... but never tried to explain it to people who have not memorized the Poe's life ... so I do not know if what has been said is true. <br /> This movie tells the story of a writer "ethan poe" and his cousin "ann" .. who are both descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they?!? apparently, people give what their ancestors did.This guy, ethan poe, is actually Ethan "usher", who is supposed to be the descendant of the story "the house of Usher" which was written by Edgar Allen Poe.Anne's brother sometimes arrives to try to rape her ... Ann is also hunted, at a time of the film, by three different people in the same street (seriously, three ... they are like right behind her and staring at her and she does not even realize). the characters who are murdered, appear at the end to try to save the situation ... but they can not. in the end, Ann shoots Ethan as he tries to kill his best friend. of course, before shooting her, she must shout "never again!" this movie should not be seen anymore!
