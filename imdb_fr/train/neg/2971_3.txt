Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, bland. <br /> <br /> The plot claims that a mysterious woman ("Batwoman") is interfering in Batman's territory and that Batman tries to fight a trio Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, he tries to determine who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing starkly wrong about this, but there is nothing really special either, knowing that this really brought out the problem. <br /> <br /> The fantasy mask had revived Bruce's long lost love. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a major event in Mr. Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> Even the movie Batman Beyond, Return of the Joker, has explored the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman possessed some minor minor intrigues, many of the formula completed by a mediocre centerpiece on a cruise ship. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had at its peak.
