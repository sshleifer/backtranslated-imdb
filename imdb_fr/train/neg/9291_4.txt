I can not believe that none of the official critics of this film warn people that it contains two scenes of sexual abuse quite disturbing. It is as if our culture accepts this type of behavior that is simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is assaulted repeatedly and under pressure never holds the men accountable for their actions, and no one else does made. A man is prevented from ending the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only by "you can not force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, you want a woman's point of view, the film is a disappointment. This "throws a bone" to women by letting them be both fighters and qualified leaders, but the film is much more defined by romance - characterized by the fact that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This incredible martial arts fighter does not use any of her fighting skills to try to repel her attackers. She never even apologizes to them - rather, she seems to apologize. All in all, it's a depressing and overwhelming film, with great cinematography and cool fighting scenes, but not as good as Hero by far.
