I chose this film by the cover which was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. The girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the film will probably see a resurgence just because it is in the limelight now, being married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you have not seen it, do not waste your time. A bad movie with super surfers, real surfers and a beautiful and beautiful film was in the hands of God.
