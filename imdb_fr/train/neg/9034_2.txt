The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo does not look good and I do not understand half of what she said because of her exaggerated focus for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays her inconceivable role and Constance Bennett is just crazy, except for some of her funny cries. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish he had more lines, because he disappeared in the second part of the story. In addition, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon so young. I'd only seen her in those crazy roles she'd played from the late '60s to the' 80s and in a tired old woman. In terms of history, the best part could be the last minute when we see a stuntman doing incredible things on skis, posing as Douglas falling on the slopes. It was amazing and humorous images. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see how this movie - Garbo's latest - was not a box office success. It's too late, still talking about disappointments. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it too and called him.
