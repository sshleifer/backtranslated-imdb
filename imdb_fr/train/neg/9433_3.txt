I bought Unhinged because I let myself be sucked by the bloody picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the victims are shown and honestly, I can tell you that they have a much better appearance in the still images than in the movie. <br /> <br /> That said, let's examine the plot. A group of schoolgirls going to a rock concert (through the deep and dark woods of one of the longest driving sequences ever recorded on celluloid) slide off the road. The car did not suffer any visible damage but apparently, it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or maybe she had read the script and was she already in coma before the beginning of the filming ). <BR /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large, isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama than by the presence of all the actors of the film. For some reason, however, this house has no roads leading to it. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged listening to strange conversations between a rich old bitch (who looks like George Washington dragging) and her equally simple and sexually repressed daughter. The girls were apparently in no hurry to return from this concert as they had taken more clothes than the Gilligan's Island cast for this three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> At the moment we, the spectators, come to the scenes to kill, we do not worry anymore. We want someone to kill us just to put an end to our suffering. Unhinged finally ends with a pretty shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the ending, the good idea in the movie, was written first, then the writers tried to make a movie that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is finally a boring movie with bad acting, inept direction, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry, I do not know where it's coming). You will have an idea of ​​the gravity of this film during the opening credits. When, for some reason that has never been explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes, while the characters do not talk about anything that needs to be recalled. Do not waste your time. You will simply feel clueless and will want to recover your time and money.
