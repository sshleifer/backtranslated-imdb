From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a smoker on your hands! This film had potential. Under all the mud, there are remnants of what could have been transformed into a decent film, if not interesting. The end product is a mess, however. In addition to free nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II is a laughable excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him a nugget of credibility, but even he can not raise her above the level of shit. <br /> <br /> Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this criticism will be forced to accept on the face We consider it a true continuation of the events of the first part . We begin with a burial of one of the characters of the original and, in the first ten minutes, we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to face a group of werewolves. The film is pretty well paced and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it's just not well filmed. One of the highlights is the music of a punk band called Babel. Even though their song is played often enough, it is rather catchy. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are numerous. First, the acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. Both leaders Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe miss everything you would like for such characters. The writing is miserable, the writing redundant and the direction amateur. There are some good special effects stuff, but the craziest ones weigh a lot in numbers. Sybil Danning is nice to watch, but his acting performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks at the role he plays, but his voice and his game are unconvincing. Much of the dialogue takes place in an unintelligible language, which may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I still enjoy stories of true believers fighting seemingly invincible forces of evil. A scene where a small group of good people walk in a dark forest and shoot down a band of werewolves is quite exciting. Type of. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the movie a little more convincing. 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Note: At the time of writing this article, youtube.com censors have still not deleted the ending credits with Sybil Danning many times while the Babel song is playing! Catch him while you can!
