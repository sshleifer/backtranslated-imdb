I saw Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other beautiful works from the blaxploitation canon of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. For his lack of talent in film production and his absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), the human tornado can not be overcome. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is having a party with a white woman, when local racist policemen invade the house for no good reason, and you would not know it! The woman in bed with old Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees it: "He made me do it!" Dolemite scream: "& $ * @ $ are you real ???" Subtlety has never been his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of the fame of Ghostbusters), the errors of continuity (the characters look one way and the other, the costume of Dolemite changing color in each shot of his box number night), and demonic eyes in his first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire his enthusiasm. Whether it's jumping completely off a cliff or barking orders at her nursery rhyme band (eg: Fast! In the cave! I have a plan to let this mother $ * @ (dig her own tomb!), Commits the man Certainly, he goes to sea, never more than every time he makes kung-fu.The decisive battle is filmed at high speed, but sometimes slows down to let Rudy pose and squeezes I'm not sure they wanted it too as if they had accelerated the film or if they really wanted us to believe it was so fast. "In any case," The Matrix "is not not the case. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, a bit like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun, and you have to pay tribute to those people. Their efforts - it's not that much - take advantage of my warm recommendations.
