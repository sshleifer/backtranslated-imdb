I find it rather useless to comment on this "film" for the simple reason that it has nothing to say. It looks like a rotten egg that has nothing good to show the world, because it is rotten like another endless. number of eggs have been before. But as a comment is obligatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... <br /> <br /> The dirt is certainly the right word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists on portraying the so-called "Romanian reality" that followed the communist era (from 1990 to the present). <br /> <br /> In no case is it recommended to non-Romanians as to others (who have recently found an amateur camera, lack of conspiracy, lack of director / actor quality, etc., noise , etc. being fashionable and even artistic): look and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but do a favor to the other well-meaning members of IMDb write an online review as it will mislead, irritate and will eventually waste their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among others) has any value whatsoever, an educational value, because it gives the example: "How not to make a film."
