<br /> <br /> The film begins as a humorous film. It is about the boy who is chosen, who has no parents and who is madly in love with the school's # 1 girl. Nothing surprising in the movie, there is nothing you can guess in the future. Toby Mcguire shows us that he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a scenario like this one. Maybe children under ten will enjoy the movie, but this one is a bit violent for the younger ones. You can not forget movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I almost got out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was the computer animation, BUT even that is nothing to put in the tree! So, my recommendation: do not see this movie even if you are paid for it!
