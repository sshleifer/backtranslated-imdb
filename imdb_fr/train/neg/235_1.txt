The beautiful cast can not elevate this routine story of a secretary murdered by her married mistress. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since we have only the prosecution side, we do not answer any of these questions. This is the type of fare that seduces the clubs "He Woman, Man Hater" of America. As presented, this is the story of an innocent woman who finds herself "stuck" in a romantic affair with a well-known lawyer. Is it possible that, IF she had not been two to time her boyfriend and to have an affair with a married man, this murderous and sordid incident could have been avoided? When you look at this, do not worry about going to the refrigerator, you will not miss anything.
