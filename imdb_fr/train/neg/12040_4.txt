I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not say more about the accuracy of this story. However, as an independent film, I found it very boring. The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular, but they were simply obvious. CGI. The acting is mediocre and Brad Pitt was probably chosen to attract the ladies. But he is not a good warrior, too pretty, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> The asset is the design. This film looks good with the impressive landscape and castle buildings / walls. I like a movie that tries at least to give color to the accents of the characters, but this film seems to ignore it completely. we hear everything that is American, Scottish English, except what you can expect from a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> In total, I do not recommend this film for a seated family. It's too long and young people will be bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's acceptable if you do not care about the lack of realism.
