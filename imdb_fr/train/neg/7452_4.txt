For me, this movie seemed to fall. The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if it comes from the composition or simply from his behavior, but I doubt that Glover can ever portray a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and it's always obvious in his performances. Other than that, the movie is your serial killer story. Nothing very innovative.
