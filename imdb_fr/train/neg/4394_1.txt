The John Goodman program was pretty awful, but it stinks. The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless. It was written by someone who left incoherent memories of childhood rebellion, but who never acquired the slightest sense of adult perspective in the years that followed. Paranoia reigns over the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everyone is unpleasant and without reason. The plot is predictable, but the show goes from one inexplicable and unrelated scene to another in such a useless way that there is no pleasure in watching it. The worst part is that no one in the production team seems to have ever seen snow!
