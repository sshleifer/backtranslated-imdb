Tromaville High has become an amber waste land thanks to the consequences of the accidental release of toxic waste by the neighboring nuclear power station. <br /> <br /> Uncontrolled chaos, full of absurd violence and brutal behavior. Rather horrible, visibly destined to be, a mess of film with filmmakers who let go of the reins, allowing distribution without talent to give free rein to his reign. Craft was a long way from Troma's goal list for this gore sleazefest. The society of honor is composed of punks with painting works and crazy outfits. The German teacher who becomes a member, thanks to a "toxic kiss", has trails on one side of her face that really gave me goose bumps. The poisonous monster, which sent the ANNOYING punks to the end, is pretty cool, though. <br /> The connoisseurs of the movie basket will kiss wholeheartedly.
