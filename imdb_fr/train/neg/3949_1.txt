I had a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunning was an added feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was associated with the original. But you know what they say about those who "suppose": it makes a "donkey" with "you" and "me". I had read before watching that BII contains many images of the original and that it was performed by the actress Love. As I watched Boogeyman's return, I decided to stay in the original movie to see the famous death scene with a toothbrush. Before I knew it, the movie was finished. Flight. I think I thought it was BII because its title is similar to one of BII's alternative titles. Oh well, at least it was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes. Many, many mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli Anyway he thinks? Does he really believe that the same film will sell in different forms? There is nothing original that holds Part III This is essentially a flashback of the original by the eyes of a psychic, which delivers us a game terribly boring as and when everything happens. This is the movie. Oh, and a death scene by stereo, but you can read that in someone else's criticism. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is forever lost. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to watch immediately.
