There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in my criticism because I strongly support local films, but I can not help but endure the unfavorable reaction of this film. It is slow, boring and unnecessary limit. Even "almost pleasurable and credible moments" were immediately shattered by painful shots and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually like, were only passable in this movie. It was as if the director was trying to make a televised melodramatic soap opera, then got excited and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years should be RA, but that did not change my faith in local movies. There will be more good movies, as long as more movies like these are not made.
