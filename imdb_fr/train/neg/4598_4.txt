The wife of a London-based theater producer is hoping to find an American singer and dancer playing the lead role in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American woman who lives fashion in the circles of society. Unfortunately, the couple have already met by themselves, the girl thinking that he was the producer of the show married to his friend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring should have deterred any misunderstanding!). The Wafty musical Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers is finally brought back to earth by the silly scenario of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, full of juvenile behaviors. Astaire and Rogers do not only "meet", they meet in a ridiculous way (he dances like crazy in the suite of the hotel above his own and complains) The spectators of 1935 did not care probably not the way these two would meet - as long as they did it and happily. Seen today, the central characters do not seem motivated to find themselves in each other's arms: he wears the headdress of flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "without fantasy" in the department of love) and she gave him the brushstroke. . Nothing but a little dance could not heal! This glamorous duet is deliberately unreal as are the parameters of London and Venice, but we simply observe because the main roles are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for the poor ... those who do not fear stupid intrigue. The musical moments break the monotony of the artificial scenario, without however exceeding the foolishness surrounding. ** from ****
