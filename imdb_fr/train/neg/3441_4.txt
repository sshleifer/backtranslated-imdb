What was that? It is obvious that someone read Stephen King and Sartre during the same semester. We have an existential anxiety mixed with a cheap horror. There were troubling moments, but each was canceled by horrible music, computer-generated images or acting games. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange stories like this is that they are lazy. Even the work of David Lynch sometimes seems to be the same thing, and just like his interesting shows and movies, it lasts far too long. And unfortunately, it's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The distribution was seductive and that's about the limit. I guess it affects the feelings of teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but does not make the characters kind enough for us to care about their fate ... whatever they are. The final scene leaves everything ambiguous.
