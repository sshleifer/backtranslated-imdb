I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this failure seemed to last forever. This is one of those films that enjoys the sad placement of the PG-13 without being suitable for children. Jokes are not just low or low jokes, they are coarse, lecherous and many acts cross borders, not only bad taste, but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been cut out to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could have made more brilliance as an R-rated movie if the funny had been left in it. (Outbidding? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It's a total waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm ready to give anything. At 45 minutes, the film felt like it was coming to an end ... and we were ready to do it. The end is picturesque but does not save the rest of this trap / tourist trap from a rental. 1/2 star (glad to have seen it as a freebie ... would have been sick of paying hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe)
