If you do not mind playing with your emotions, then this movie will not bother you. On the other hand, if you like the mysteries of British crime, follow the clues and see how logically they end up in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to this disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police are using CCTV cameras very early to collect clues to the mystery, huge truck that stopped and blocked the sight of children just before his disappearance is not caught in the camera trap. It is a critical element of the mystery. It is incoherent to see the car in which the children are filmed and not the big truck that is so important to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of tracking equipment. the children's movements but misses the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment is the search for vehicles likely to have entered the crime scene from visible locations on the screen adjacent to the crime scene in the framework of index development. <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The manager tries to place the car in the crime scene park on the right, several meters from the flower stand, while she could have parked immediately behind or even on the side; like the huge truck did. <br /> <br /> * The forensic team is so meticulous that it finds a discarded cell phone in a sewer line several miles from the crime scene, but finds no evidence of blood. of the head injury at the crime scene, even though they had secured it just hours after the disappearance and it was not raining. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs have not been used at all to find missing children; this of the country which is well known for having developed the hunting dog for research and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a high-profile news item does not reveal the allegedly innocent truck driver who stopped at the flower kiosk. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical for the mother to go so far and make as much effort to leave clues to her fibers for her future murder investigators - even persuading her daughter to do the right thing. even though she just could not get out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense to ask her daughter to put carpet fibers under her nails, she could just as easily ask her daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home in a park. cluttered residential. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect who abducted the girl was portrayed as mentally slow / confused - what justifies her drowning without knowing the mother ?? but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and fully exercise his right not to incriminate himself. <br /> <br /> There are other inconsistencies like this that will lead to the disappointment of a true sleuth lover. "Five Days" is a very small British crime story.
