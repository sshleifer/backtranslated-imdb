Where to start? What is the best way to describe how awful this movie is? <br /> <br /> Let's start with country humor. It's not very funny Add a group of musicians imitating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Too bad, poor Art Carney, who should have known better than making this movie. <br /> <br /> And then, there is the plot. A roadie whose purpose of life is to work on a show from Alice Cooper meets a girl whose goal in life is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And just when the movie should end, they can not create a last scene more plausible than one - well, I do not I will not ruin If you really want to see the movie, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Some actors inform you that it will be a movie "B" or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them - and he plays a bigger role. This is a sure sign that the movie will probably not be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to expectations, surpasses them even by being worse than poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say this. This is the movie to which all bad movies are compared. And none is worse than Roadie.
