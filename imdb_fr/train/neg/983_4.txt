When Marlene Dietrich was labeled a box-office poison in 1938 as one of the few actresses so named by the trade journals, they were films like The Garden Of Allah. How can a film be so beautiful to be seen and so dull and so dull? I can not tell myself either that Marlene, if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot stuck in a story as old fashioned. <br /> <br /> The Garden of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor It was a novel set up at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on an adaptation of the piece with Mary Anderson which was held during 241 performances in 1911-1912. He then got two silent screen adaptations. The story tells the story of a monk who fled the monastery in French Tunisia to see some of what he lacks in the world. He meets a woman in the same way, single and has spent her best years caring for a sick relative. She is now traveling in the desert and the two meet on a train. <br /> <br /> The woman is of course Marlene and the fleeing monk is Charles Boyer. I do not know what David O. Selznick was thinking about filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it acceptable to the public. But you can bet that moviegoers in 1936, when they spent their money getting a ticket, hoped to see Marlene as a modern-day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was a romance and a seduction of the desert they were waiting for. <br /> <br /> As far as the monks are concerned, you must remember that they are autonomous in their monasteries and in this we bottle a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink its economic situation if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but on the part of the leader, Charles Waldron, they have the right to be concerned about their personal interest. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are many religious platitudes here. by a pair of wires that do not really fit the parts. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this movie with an eye for the special color of the desert, the cinematography and forget the plot.
