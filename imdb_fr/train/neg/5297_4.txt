It really surpasses me when someone comes across a movie like this and claims to be one of the worst slasher movies right now. This is by far not one of the worst, it's still not a good movie, but it's not the worst. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake, then come back and tell me if you think the night brings Charlie is the worst. The film has a good job and editing, which is more than I can say for many extremely obscure slasher movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not take into account the deaths on the screen, there is a dead one where you see his size to see tearing a neck, but all the other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that it is not a slasher movie, but a bad one. <br /> <br /> The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film arrived at the end of the second cycle of slasher. It was therefore a reflection on the traditional elements of slasher, made in the language. For example, after a murder, Charlie goes to the welcome sign of the city and marks the population less. It's something that can only make you laugh. <br /> <br /> If you like slasher movies, treat yourself to a watch. It's a little different from your usual slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The movie comedy is telling the audience to relax and not take the film so damn serious. You can forget the movie, you may remember it. I will remember because I like the name.
