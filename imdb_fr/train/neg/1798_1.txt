How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne while remaining zero? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat did it. It sucks and it likes. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn people about. This is a vile atrocity that causes vomiting, which is simply letting you watch so that you feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factor. <br /> <br /> For a film about heavy metal, it certainly does not seem to understand what it is or what it represents. This film manages to make heavy metal look lame and it was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. It's quite an achievement, even if it's negative. <br /> <br /> A candy or treat = so bad that you will be mad at yourself for watching it. Hope this simple equation will keep you away from this brainless movie.
