I admit that Emma is, in my opinion, the greatest novel ever written. He is as close to perfection as any mortal creation. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. <br /> <br /> The comparison with Gwyneth Paltrow's version is inevitable - this version is much more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Kate Berkinsale (having already played Flora Post in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard creates a suitably decorative Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are much too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong - first of all, it does not look good for Mr. Knightley. It may be because he plays this role as a censored Victorian pastor. It's bad agreement. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that of length. In simple terms, the film is much too short - to get the right kind of sensation, it must be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter dream - the whole dialogue is already there. Simply prune and arrange it properly. Andrew Davies seems to think the opposite. First of all, it's a rather dark movie, and the last thing Emma should be is dark. More importantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the end into a kind of bucolic celebration. What planet or minor work of Thomas Hardy does it come from? It's totally out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I think it's extremely presumptuous to try to improve perfection. <br /> <br /> Check out the Paltrow version or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
