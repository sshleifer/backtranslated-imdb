This documentary (or rather, I should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of the ridicule with which people can be, when they have all their enthusiasm for something like this. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. It's unconscious, it just destroyed it. However, there was something positive in this visual effect (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information contained in this fake documentary was totally false, and it's really disappointing because it came from scientists, which is why it deserves a The idea of ​​hydrogen is an example of false information. It is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to produce it in these proportions, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what is actually happening in the stomach. the stomach of a dragon. There are a lot of substances in nature that contain hydrogen, but it's not necessary to steal an animal like that, and hydrogen does not appear for nothing, so it's impossible. Anyway, there is actually something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain how the dragons survive according to of that. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth, but that explains at least, of course, why they went extinct. Cryptologists are probably called themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies as in this fake documentary, and what's worse, some people buy them. But I do not think a person who is interested in science would believe in dragons after watching this. These fake scientists waste their time.
