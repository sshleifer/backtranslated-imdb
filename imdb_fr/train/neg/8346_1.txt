The title should have been the walker. The guy spends 90% of the movie walking. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life stealing people's identity for nothing. He gets no profit, no money, nothing that claims to be another person. <br /> <br /> Nobody was able to understand why he claimed to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear in this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was shit. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director is a loser who wants to be someone else. But what he really should do is have a real job, because after his movie, I do not think he has a chance to become a film producer.
