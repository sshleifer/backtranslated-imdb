A ruthlessly painstaking and painfully non-funny attempt to transplant the character of Mel Brooks' Sheriff Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom. It's as bad as some people say! <br /> <br /> This only serves to remind the unsuspecting viewer that everything in this supposed comedy is supposed to be a joke and how desperate it is to laugh! <br /> <br /> However, it's quite interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. try his best to emulate Cleavon Little. His embarrassment is reflected in every scene. He was much more funny in the HBO movie El Diablo than in this slice of cheese! <br /> <br /> The best and the funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
