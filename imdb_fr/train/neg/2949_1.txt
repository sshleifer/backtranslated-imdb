Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? Let me give you a choice you can either a) shred it and flush it to the toilet, or b) make a movie based on Whoopi Goldberg's postulate as a futuristic police officer in trouble, associated with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms such as "I'm not mistaken" blows the raspberries on the basis that it's funny. That's right, you would choose the option that has more merit - flush the toilet. <br /> <br /> This must be seen to believe it. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit into the category "So bad, it's good". I on TV when I was writing - and while watching, I felt the need to consult IMDb to record my disgust. <br /> <br /> Considering that Jurassic Park was created two years ago, how on earth do they think the public would not tolerate a man wearing a rubber suit anymore? The working group should have just walked and damned the consequences. All concerned will go to hell for this waste of criminal money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm about to implode.
