Bigfoot always interested me, so when I was looking for a movie to rent, it caught my attention. It was the worst $ 4.50 I have ever spent and I want to get my money back! Please, do not waste your money on it! It was one of the cheapest films I have ever seen. The whole movie was incredibly boring and I often found myself rolling my eyes and I did not even look at it all the way. I'm just fed up. The acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. All this turned out to be a really bad movie, boring and a total waste of time and money. I hope someday they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but by then I will have to miss countless misses like this to find the real masterpiece.
