Deep Shock is like a TV movie: a plethora of commercial-grade actors, a creature poorly designed to be the "bad guy", and a scenario full of technical and political jargon and importance that he does not know what to do. with. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie because of the creature (I like to see what the filmmakers have in mind for their projects in these cheap videos), and from the beginning, I was disappointed because the creature on the box was not that of the movie. The actors I was expecting because of the type of film that it is (really generic and have not been thought beyond a certain point). The music was typical, an unreflective symphonic action music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, as well as the design of mini-submarines. The film was very well cast, with guiding screens to let you know in which movie the story unfolds. But anyway, there is not much history here. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 star IMO. The boring mission of search and destruction to blow up the North Pole and those creatures that protect it ... a little lame. Even Lamer is the marked love relationship between two characters you do not see coming. Make this film a film that tries to stage the actors' career in a video. Do not bother yourself.
