turned out to be another unsuccessful attempt by the laughable science fiction chain. I do not know who wrote the screenplay and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it's a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow at hand in the movie. Aaaaaaah! when I saw this part, I lost all hope. Then ... they left for Heorot in what appears to be the ship in which Christopher Columbus sailed! When they reached Heorot (which is supposed to be a Norwegian reception hall), the group of science fiction idiots decided to make Heorot look like a big stone castle. when I saw this part .. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction has not produced a good movie yet, so I do not know why I hope so too. Oh..and Grendel and his mother are so stupid. (This comment is off topic about "Grendel") If someone from the science fiction channel reads this ... there are some good tips. IS NOT EVERY FILM THAT YOU ARE PART OF A GREAT MONSTER THAT CAN HUNTER PEOPLE IN HALF, IT IS NOT THIS OF SCIENCE FICTION! AND ALSO, STOP MOLDING LOW-CATEGORY ACTORS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN IN YOUR MOVIES! It does not help the film, but make it worse !!!
