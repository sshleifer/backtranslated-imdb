Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: the hands of fate" has dragged more than "Dukes". I had more fun digging through the gigantic plot holes than the movie ever gave me. Let's talk about some ... <br /> <br /> There was a notable script death and rebirth when Sheev talks to the Dukes and they do not respond. He shrugs and moves forward, since neither Knoxville nor Scott know what he's talking about (neither are we). It was as if the engine was dead and had been restarted. <br /> <br /> The few times General Lee flew in the air were not even so exciting. Nothing that I saw in the television series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was angry with Luke for stealing the girl he loved. The only reason it works is that the script actually dropped it (though roughly). The rest of the time, it seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> The terrible accent (or lack thereof) of Seann William Scott. <br /> <br /> I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were the bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson appears beautifully on the big screen. She really felt like one of the best actors in the movie. It tells you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the film's heyday, I encouraged Boss Hogg and the villains to crush the entire Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have been enough. <br /> <br /> This is not supposed to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a sense of frustration at the awful writing and execution of what could have been a truly comforting film. <br /> If only we could erase and start again ...
