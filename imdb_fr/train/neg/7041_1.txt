What else can you say about this movie, if it's really awful? Tina Louise and Adam West explain why, but that's all, but their talents are wasted in this junk. I think they have used a duplicate Some scenes of Adam, as when he runs, because we do not see his face. If Adam was embarrassed to be in Zombie Nightmare, imagine what he must have felt about it ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but still, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (look at the first and last version of the Mystery Science Theater 3000) compared to that. The gang is very annoying and overly acting actors.A scam of The Wild One with Marlon Brando, of course.Tina looks beautiful though.I hope she and Adam will have a good salary !! Pass!
