Black and white film. Good photography. Credible characters. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> I lost another perfect night watching a movie that others have described as "worthy" and "very good". There is good action here and the backdrop decor is good (it would have been necessary to do more with that) but it is very slow to grow and never develop. It's totally sex-based without much love with a lot of unnecessary nudity. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to watch with your family, do not be part of the movie. Otherwise, you will have trouble getting away. Although this film is long, it is only about 1 inch deep!
