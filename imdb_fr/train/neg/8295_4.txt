I tend to like character-oriented movies. I also think that Hope Davis always has a good job, so I had high hopes for this film. These hopes were quickly shattered. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of this film is its orientation. There are many scenes that are awake dream sequences. The film frequently uses the character of Denis Leary as alter ego of the character of Campbell Scott. It does not work at all for me. It would have worked better as a play than as a film. <br /> <br /> The plot is also problematic. It is important that the characters of a movie make a trip and find themselves in a different place from where they started. I did not feel that the characters had grown up in the experiences described in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing was not done well either. In the middle of the film, there was a very big hollow that was unusually boring. <br /> <br /> Except for acting, which I have always felt strong, this film has failed in almost every aspect of cinema.
