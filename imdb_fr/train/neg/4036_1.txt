From the beginning, this film is poor and lacks conviction, but most people would struggle to show their commitment for a scenario as uninspiring as this one. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also supported by strange scenes (eg, Cemetry idling) that you think could lead somewhere but seem to be losing only a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange combination of gangster / sitcom that, I'm sure, seemed like a good idea at the time, but if there was a case for someone who would need to be honest with the scriptwriter, so here it is. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is fine but then he seems to have a character who always plays, so I start to wonder if he has received a script or just filmed and said to react as usual. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. It reminds me of Python's quote (I think) about Shakespere, his "comedies" - if he wanted to be funny, he would have made a joke. Well, I did not see one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did it because I was watching it with a friend and hoping it would be better. <br /> <br /> It's not.
