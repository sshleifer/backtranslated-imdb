Spoilers? Maybe some details, but nothing intriguing is related Not as if it mattered with this movie. <br /> <br /> The rage of the air blatantly removes the principle of infiltration into the air of Executive Decision. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos who wear black puffy shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible bulletproof vests because their silly tactics (similar to that used by 3rd graders year when playing Star Wars) a shower of gunfire. <br /> <br /> What amused me the most in this film is the use of similar look-alike actors. You'll immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who has ever played in a movie that you really liked, even though it was so long ago that you probably could not place it (it was Porky's) . Here, Cyril plays the role of a character of Bill Paxton. The most hilarious is the pig Gil Gerard, who is so big that you'll never recognize him as Buck Rogers on TV. Instead of evoking his past as a heroic character, Gerard gives us a passable interpretation of the tough guy, which was clearly imagined for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord offers us a nice hybrid performance of the type Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In the last 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's acting has deteriorated remarkably. It's not so much a regurgitation of lines that he could really memorize. <br /> <br /> One of the elements of this film is a CD-ROM containing classified information. It is carried by hand, and it is apparently incredibly unencrypted, despite the security atmosphere of Gerard's NSA character. What joke. I seriously doubt that the information supposed to appear on the CD can even be all assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed plane without a silencer, the shots are about as strong as canned air and silences a person, so apparently no budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is quite amusing. The use of a coffee maker by the flight attendant is pretty much the most realistic representation of the violence in the film. When she intuitively gets acquainted with the Uzi mini pistol, which must be one of the worst gun models, it's too stupid. A real elite team would have MP-5s for these kinds of things or maybe SOCOMM .45 companies, or even custom Hi-Powers if they were really old schools, or maybe something FN 5.7 if they came from school ... The standard lame number 92F are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their coolness after Lethal Weapon I. The wicked, allegedly experienced soldiers of the fortune type, have a varied mix of nonsense, like the aforementioned Uzi mini-pistol and a Tec-9 with the incredible non-functional canon extension that is not a muffler. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other commentators: the stewardess and Ice-T lowered the boat to 10,000 feet for "breathable air "before opening the door. And I also had the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to close the door, that she simply gave up on this point. Regarding the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Hazard that escape Roscoe P. Coltrane at the "collar" could shame this film for using archival footage. They obviously chose the incredible SR-71 (and retired) because they could not afford an F-117 in stock. Aside from the fact that they were already immobilized in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth plane in the sense of B-2, and that it is at close range ... I am not an expert, but I doubt that it is invisible on Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, repeated references to "F-15s" when displaying F-16s were laughable. The details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would initially put as few passengers on a 747, not to mention all that was silly about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What show. Catch it on Stars or something. Do not pay to rent it, but watch for it. In the running for the worst movie of all time, with No Holds Barred, who had at least some originality.
