SPOILERS (ALTHOUGH NULL WAS NEVER ANNOUNCED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE FILM) <br /> <br /> In fact, Robin Williams is pretty good at this situation as Sy. He does a very humane psycho, even a sympathetic one, and really disappears in the character - a feat for such a recognizable performer. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rest of the movie is such a mess. Secondary performances (and performers) would not seem out of place in a soft-core porn (it does not help that all characters except Sy are 100% cardboard). From time to time, the director seems to be trying to counter the suspense: we know from the first moments that a Sy is a real job, b) he survives and c) he gets caught by the cops. the end. So we have only to think about the ins and the means, and the answers provided are not interesting. <br /> <br /> The intrigue is cumbersome and artificial and presents insane moments (for example, the husband condemns his wife for her expensive tastes, even if she seems to spend all her spare time in the local discount hypermarket) . About two-thirds of the time, Sy is doing something as irremediably stupid as one wonders how much he really cares about his project of great revenge. And the last cliche explanation of his psychosis, straight out of "Peeping Tom", is a terrible copout. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is of the worst kind. It's not crushed, awkward, unbelievable, or otherwise bad that could be considered fun even for bad movie fans. Instead, each line is purely and terribly functional - it's as if the director gives a summary of the plot to a newspaper editor by saying, "Hey, I need a workable script on that - in one o'clock". It made me want to scream, honestly. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a throwback for suburban thrillers, beware of the help of the 80s and 90s ("The hand that cradles the cradle", for example) and although it is certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. Sy's fetishism sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable, but it's not enough in itself to make the movie work. In the end, the lack of know-how on the part of everyone involved, with the exception of Robin Williams, sinks this one. 3 out of 10
