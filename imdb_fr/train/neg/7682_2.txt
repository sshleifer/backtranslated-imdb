In 1955, THE COBWEB is a cast of stars that goes from the silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to the offspring of Actors Studio SUSAN STRASBERG. Located in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about which you are wondering ... a dramatic drama? Doctor / patient relationship? Shock therapy treatment? No, this howler talks about who will choose the draperies of a psychiatric hospital! You think I'm kidding? You will not believe your eyes by watching this incredible story that has been turned into a movie! Chief McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all patients at the hospital to be involved in the design, selection and completion of the necessary new drapes. McIver's wife at the marble playing with the mouth GLORIA GRAHAM also wants to get 2 cents on this monumental task. It's the same for Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Led by VINCENT MINELLI, you may be wondering if he really got too involved in the details because of his marriage to WAR JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are lost in this hokey story. What were they thinking?
