This film is a joke and must be one of the worst films of Stallone. This is a typical film of the 80s where you have a man who destroys the entire army by himself. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but this is where Arnold kills the terrorist while here you have a specific country presented as the villain. This film is a typical anti-Soviet American propaganda. It's true that it was the culmination of the cold war, but I'm fed up with the fact that Communists or Nazis are always portrayed as enemies. There are so many American movies that have this thing in common. Why does not a film show that Americans are the enemy? Who will believe that a single soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think something like this really happened? At first glance, an average American brainwashed viewer would certainly do it.
