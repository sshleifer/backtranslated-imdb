Due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, they had to shoot this episode in three days. It's pretty crappy, made up of repeated cut + glued clips from season 2 and has been described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why producers could not wait to pull something decent who knows. I suppose that because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only come out with an episode of flashback or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto that. half-assery. This episode also marks the last appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
