Disavowed by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster struck Japanese theaters before coming to the United States and immediately went to the video, where it was not seen again until the Turner networks needed other than informative advertising to occupy their slots from 3am to 6am. adhesive tape in the bottom of their trash. The name Smithee is supposed to be used when the studio pirate so much the film that the director does not want anymore that his name is associated there. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not fully attribute the studio to this one. The actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one lineage after another. The plot is complicated. The special effects are unimpressive. Parts that are not laughable are simply boring. The script or the book had to be good. Why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this failure? But something went wrong from page to screen. Summary: avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad, it's good.
