Do not waste your time, let alone pay for this stubble! How it was done is beyond me. (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I have already summarized this trash movie, but ...) The acting was awful, as if they all needed lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think cinematography was the only thing that was not going to be totally annoying ... Well, maybe the sound was minimalist. The good thing to do is that if they could make this film, or even make money, there might be hope for any writer with a REAL idea. So, take all your heart! I guess the same goes for the actors ... if these people are really paid, then you can too!
