Having not read the novel, I can not say how faithful this film is. The story is a typical mysterious material: the killer targets the newlyweds; Female investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Yes, it looks like a soap opera and that's exactly how it happens. The first two-thirds are boring, with the exception of the murders, and the last third makes a partial return as he picks up speed before drawing his winding conclusion. <br /> <br /> Act is strictly inferior to normal, although it is difficult to blame the actors alone: ​​the scenario is atrocious. During the last third, you stop noticing because the movie becomes interesting, but it's only the last third. The director Russell Mulcahy is really in his element, but he can not do more with a televised budget and network censorship on his back. He is rather limited to quick cuts and deformed lenses, although he managed to take some pictures "under the floor" during the killings in the club toilets. Unfortunately, as this is done for television, the composition details that he uses so well with a larger picture are not found. Note to producers: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when hiring him. <br /> <br /> In summary: this film is bad compared to the cinema and mediocre compared to the television (look rather CSI). If you fancy a movie like this, I have great suggestions: get a copy of "Deep Red" by Dario Argento (my highest recommendation, great movie), "Opera" or even " Darkness". They are stronger in all categories.
