and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the writer had never seen a horror movie before and did not realize that everything he had written was clichéd and confused and was parodied to perfection in movies like "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Between the frightening bits lies the most banal and boring dialogue ever written. Stupid "we go to the promo ball" junk. I wanted to scratch my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was really not necessary to make this film. The head lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking, "Really?" The guy is obsessed with her? Really? <br /> <br /> All the characters act stupidly, including the police. (Cover the squad in teams of 2, front and back!) Not a sleeping policeman sitting in his car with the window down, waiting for his throat to be sliced. <br /> <br /> The killer in series is content with swans murder everyone he wants without the slightest problem. No resistance from the victims (or doors). No one has the least protection or the slightest idea of ​​riposte (or activate the security lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like mentally handicapped sheep. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you're an unconditional gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All murders are kept on screen and are - ahem - made with taste. (So, hoo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of these murders is the least interesting. Most of the time, they have already happened as we discover it. <br /> <br /> The only missing snapshot was the cat that always appears in this kind of movies. "Oh kitty, you scared me, I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And in the end, when the murderer dies, well, let's say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience mocked everything she said. It was too stupid to believe and not scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy movie. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way - no coronation of a prom king or queen, no tiara, no bucket of blood.) <Br /> <br /> > So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday 13" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (none of them) to scare you with some original twists.
