I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought that "Scary Movie", although not a good movie, was very good and fun. "Scary Movie 2" was boring, not funny and sometimes stupid. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville parody was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I must admit that I am at a disadvantage, because I have not seen some of the films that this film parodies unlike the first, where I had all practically seen them. But the bad comedy remains a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which spoiled some of what could have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes go on forever. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the same jokes are repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny first and maybe even the second time. But it continued to be so boring. The routine between the wheelchair type and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it kept repeating itself and became stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were even repeated from the first movie. For example, the "creaming" that I would call Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been bent on giving sex to her boyfriend for so long that he basically had blue balls. hell it was funny when he "creamed" it. But this time it was out of place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor in general were more fun and well programmed the first time. The humor was rather excessive and not necessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was boring and really had no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I liked Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who, in my opinion, was the funniest character of the first movie. The scene with him and the potted plant was one of my favorites of the second film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . they have a lot more comic abilities than endless jokes.
