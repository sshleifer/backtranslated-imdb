I was raised to watch the original Batman animated series and I am an avid collector of Batman graphic novels. With a cartoon hero as iconic as Batman, some traits can not be changed. The creative freedoms are very good, but when that completely changes the character, then it's too far. I bought one of the "Batman" seasons in the hope that an extra bonus could enlighten the creators reasoning for making this show such an atrocity. In an interview on the set of "The Batman", one of the artists or writers (I do not know which) said: "We felt we should not play with Batman, but we could play with the bad guys." So they decided to turn the Joker into an immature little child begging for attention, the Penguin imitating the anime, Mr. Freeze into an overpowering jewel thief, Poison Ivy into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts that Bob Kane turns in his grave. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I would like to have more hands to give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It squeezes according to my note with a 2 out of 10 just because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... rethink that! Please!
