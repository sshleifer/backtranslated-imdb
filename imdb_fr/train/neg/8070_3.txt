It's not a very good movie, but it's not a whore either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My friend and I found this movie (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAIN SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is actually quite simple after removing all the confusing garbage from the dream and unconscious state (95% of the movie.) <br /> <Ignoring the junk, which REALLY happened is this: a group of school kids goes on a rave evening. They leave and enter a car accident where everyone dies, except Cassie and Sean. This is the simplified version. (That's right, I said Sean, support me) <br /> <br /> Right after the accident, Cassie is in the hospital stuck between life and death until the very end of movie. This is where the dream party begins. <br /> <br /> The film is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's spirit and soul endure after the accident, interacting with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 quirky and Jude) as well as images evoked by her mind (Sean, the school and everything else). which surrounds it). The souls continue to do what they were defined: Annie the crazy bitch, the 2 weirdo killers (of the opening scene), the father Jude always helping people, etc. <br /> <br /> We are then caught in a long journey, shown many images (many of which my friend and I still can not relate) but it all boils down to the fact that this is not the moment for Cassie to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean are there. This is still the reality. She is fine. <br /> <br /> Then, the director adds a little spice trying to divert us again by showing a small excerpt of his dream in a strangled wheelchair. But this part is just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still struggling with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Because of the lack of space, we have not covered everything, but do not hesitate to send us an e-mail if you wish. <br /> <br />
