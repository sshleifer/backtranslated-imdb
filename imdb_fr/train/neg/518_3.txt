Bela Lugosi is not mentioned in this fantastic series of twelve-episode adventures, starring in Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, playing his role as a representative of the White Magic forces pushed against Black's, while doing proof of a strong fighting talent. wooing a young Egyptian princess, and carving out a slender, dashing figure in yacht attire, with a nautical cap. The somewhat rough plot engages Chandler / Chandu in a series of escapades to rescue his fianc√©e, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others, from the clutches of the idol-worshiping Ubasti sect, who covets the blood of Nadji to revive an old mummified princess buried on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, a regular at this entertainment, keeps the events moving, but scenes and sequences repeated, much of which is in the KING KONG Skull Island backdrop of the previous year, and in the local harbor of SON OF KONG, reduces the initial action to less than 60 minutes of the duration of the series by more than two and a half hours and, if viewed in a single session, it becomes ineffective for most viewers, except in case of insomnia.
