The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen, between the pathetic 360 Â° 'matrix' and the drama I fell asleep. I do not think the director and the pitcher can decide whether it's raining or not, because it's raining on one side of the boat and not on the other. I would say that this film is worth 1 in 10 (10 being the best, 1 the worst). Jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, one wonders if they were just catching up to waste time. I pray to anyone who reads this, DO NOT SEE IT. It's not worth the time.
