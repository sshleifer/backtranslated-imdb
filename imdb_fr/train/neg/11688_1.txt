My wife and I found this movie very unsatisfactory. While the plot keeps you busy and busy wondering what's going on, when you leave the theater, there are too many unresolved details that make no sense. Christopher Plummer, the head of an extremely wealthy New York bank, has a terrible hidden secret. Enjoying World War II business with the Nazis and concealing the stolen booty from the Jews, he keeps the evidence (diamonds and documents bearing the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he wants that never to be revealed, why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago? And diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why keep them rather than dispose of them? How did burglars discover his secret? How did they manage to focus on this safe No. 232? Detective Ace Denzel Washington also discovers that, according to the banking records, the numbers 231 and 233 of the SD Box are replaced by the number 232. Curious. He meticulously found the time, one way or another, to make an exhausting search in the bank records to discover this curious fact. All the while facing a very hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily. Wow! Talk about super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in cash in the safe that they have opened. They only take the contents of SD Box No. 232, apparently to blackmail the president of the bank. This defies any rational attempt to logically explain what the film describes as a criminal brain or its less well-designed henchmen. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using her political ties with the mayor of New York, gets permission to enter the bank that is under the control of burglars while holding many hostages. She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy the documents he now has in hand, but that does not interest him. So, what is his point of view (if any)? <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (bank president), Denzel Washington (detective), and Jodie Foster, who has problems shooting game for problems high power. <br /> <br /> The latest Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Flight Plan", was also riddled with holes that made no sense. I thought I loved Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films. <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies. I can not disagree with her on this one ... "A GASPLE OF MONEY, AND A GASPLE OF TIME." Be warned. A well-crafted film, good actors, an ugly screenplay.
