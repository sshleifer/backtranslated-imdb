An old intellectual talks about what he sees as art in the cinema. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and a few other stuff before the 80's. To conceal that he has no idea what's going on in theaters these days, he adds The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame film-art discourse. This discourse is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is filled with the cheesy effect of making Zizte change in his films. For someone who is supposed to know a lot about the cinema, it's his, speaking from the cinematographic point of view: bravo. <br /> <br /> To quote Zizek's own words - I saw 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most insanely stupid things that I never heard. At no point in your incoherent and rambling response, you are even close to anything that might be considered rational thought. Everyone in this room is now more stupid to have listened to it. I give you (two) points only, and God have pity on your soul.
