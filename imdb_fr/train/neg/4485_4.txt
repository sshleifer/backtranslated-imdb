This is where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) captivates you with a revolutionary story full of action. However, the suites are inspired by this universe and guide you to the new social or political commentary that the author wishes to make. The matrix is ​​finally the equivalent of the film. The Matrix is ​​high, alone, like an interesting movie with a strange twist in the middle.
