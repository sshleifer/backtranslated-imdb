I agree with the last speaker that this film had a very bad acting. Yes, there was a lot of blood and some nudity. But he was eclipsed by a slow, meaningless plot and a stupid end. Where was it supposed to be filmed anyway: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing this instead. A technical disadvantage that I had with the DVD is that if you turn off the Spanish subtitles, they will come back after a few scenes and then you will have to go back to the main menu and deactivate them again. Also, do not waste time on deleted scenes because there is no audio and it looks like a tourist sequence.
