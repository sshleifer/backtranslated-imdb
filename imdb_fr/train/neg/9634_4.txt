Whatever the evaluation that I give to BOOM, it is only because of the superb photographs of location of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, it only concerns the unconditionals of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (his downward phase) and RICHARD BURTON (his error phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The train of milk does not stop here anymore" and is supposed to like this adaptation of his piece a lot - but apparently he was the only one. Taylor would have hated him and Burton needed the money. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is tantamount to a bean hill with Taylor standing in a strident attitude, infuriating her servants and exchanging poor conversation with her baby as NOEL COWARD who appears to be a visitor another film when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It's so exciting that among Taylor fans, this is probably considered a "must-see" event. But if you can get through this one without having a drink in your hand, you have a leg up on me. Unfortunately, it was the film that marked the end of Taylor's take seriously as a movie actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was also disastrous and critics called it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
