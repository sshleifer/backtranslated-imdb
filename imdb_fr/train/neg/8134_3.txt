A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go to the desert for a honeymoon picnic. He seems to hear a strange noise and is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling on their picnic blanket. He wants to go around a cave, which has something to do with the work he does, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She gives in. They go on tour, but let the group get noticed. She falls on a slope where she is disturbed by insects. He is following her. He hears the strange noise again and seems to know that a bat is approaching; we do, and put ourselves in the hair. He fights her and she attacks him by biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They come out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people . He gets angry when that happens. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies and starts a Pasteur treatment for this, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then, some people are killed. We see parts of man's transformation into bats. It seems that it's not just in his mind. It is unclear whether the bat bite is the cause of these changes, as it already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> The title seems inappropriate, but it follows in the end that the same thing happens to another person. This is not a very good film, but I liked the variety of desert places, caves and ski slopes, as well as some stranger scenes. I did not think it was as bad as the others, and I did not think the 1999 Bats movie was as bad as the others (I rated it 5/10).
