This is the only movie I've seen that is made by Uwe Boll, I knew he's probably the worst director ever, who still makes video-based movies. I always wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what the movie was so serious about. After watching it, I agree that it's shit, the movie had no history. In the first 15 to 20 minutes, there were only brainless topless teenagers (I wondered for a moment if the zombies were brain dead or the girls are?), Then at night, the zombies came out of nowhere & started attacking people later, a woman started shooting at them I mean, it takes you one place then another every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy? Or a horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the closing credits. So I did not manage to watch everything, which is a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more movies. Thank you!
