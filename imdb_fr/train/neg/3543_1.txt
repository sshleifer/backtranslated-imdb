I have been watching for about two years. I have never been moved to post here before, so maybe this film is worth it, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD, I had missed it in the movies because of an illness and I never had time to look at it until now. I had not read a lot about it, and certainly not even thought about the movie for a few months. It was exactly what the boyfriend picked up in the store, so he was watched. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The shooting I mentioned in the summary at the top is in the trailer and on the poster. From the start, Jason Statham has hair. As in no other GR film. Or any JS movie that I saw. At least not in the quantities presented here. And Ray Liotta in underwear SHOULD be notified in advance. It's scary and funny, but not so ha-ha-humor. It is rather a humorous way that looks almost like the Office, but slightly mutated and therefore failing. They all say the same thing: "This movie is like nothing you expect from this movie." <br /> <br /> Now, based on our long experience of watching movies, I was expecting this movie to be a few things. Like: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not a complete and absolute farrago of the navel, < br /> <br /> () Something more substantial than a motley group of poorly realized fables of what is simply a typical Eastern mystical ideology disguised as "cool, modern, self-conscious art form", <br /> <br /> () Hope that better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed, my tone is complete, he completely failed to tick the box above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Wrong edition {rhythm throughout the shop, 8 style jumps for high level amateurs and amateur 70s, incomprehensible "intrigue" "twists !!!" delivered through hackneyed flashback fixtures, I could go on ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shot as if it was a 14 year old depressive goth who had just spent the weekend at look at Truffaut and Godard with the curtains drawn <br /> <br /> (x) The motive / the message "I'm really smart, me" is behind, and he's decided to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that stupid people (ie all those who do not like it) in the audience make sure they understand the point, <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of time. <br /> <br /> As for the indisputable ability of some people to "get" something of that, well. I'm glad you enjoyed it. A poster said something that caught my attention: people younger than 25 probably understood it better because of editing. Maybe, but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible, not less. As for "the genius is recognized only by the enlightened brigade", go suck an onion and grow. There is nothing more presumptuous and interested that people who say that another person does not know the great art is because they do not understand the "craft / materials / moon cycle / thought filaments" supreme rational "that the writer / poet / artist / palm reader / fool scholar" uses to explain his 'vision / grand scheme / his unity with Gaea / big big sick dog bucket'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, his garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, arts, stories, poetry, everything that is designed to be watched by another human being is supposed to be engaging and moving. In one way or another, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you live yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way I could react was to go back in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable disappearance. "The biggest trick he ever made was to make you believe that any part of this movie meant everything." <br /> <br /> And now, please, grind well for me.
