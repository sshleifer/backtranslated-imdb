Doppelganger has his moments, but they are rare. <br /> <br /> This is actually a mixture of grade B pop-psychic thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered and she was, in at least one case, the main suspect), or does she just have a very bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is his new roommate, and most of the actions are focused on him. <br /> <br /> The character of Newbern is rather nice and he and Barrymore do decent work (although not quite good). The mediocre (sometimes) totally awful scenario and the unimpressive direction seem to have combined to shatter the rest of the performances into oblivion. The character of Leslie Hope is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget it. <br /> <br /> The plot ends up falling apart into a bifurcat (one story is psychological realism, the other is a supernatural horror) strange climax that is so poorly designed, played and photographed that it counteracts effectively most of the value that the film had acquired before. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gives the impression of what one would expect from the first film of Mr. Knight Shamalyan. undergraduate course in cinema. The cast of actors and the script of the two main roles are enough to interest you a bit - at least until the film derails completely and completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: send your doppelganger, but avoid a first person meeting.
