What a disgrace! I checked that hoping it would be an undiscovered gem of James Garner and what a stink he turned out to be! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undeniably lame and honestly, I can say that I only have a few more hours and that I am much more stupid now. The film did not really have any quality that bought and if that stuff kept coming out, it would give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it is, it is nothing, and in this case it is not a good thing. We are subjected to the observation of an old woman of ornament who is one of the most stupid creatures to have wandered on the earth, who happens to be married to a true love, who is probably the only person alive who can bear it. She drags him in a mess after another, puts her in an embarrassing situation after another and is proud of her all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! Not worth the time it would take to watch it, so indulge yourself and skip it, you'll be happy to have done it if you knew how bad it really is.
