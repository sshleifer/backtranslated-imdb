Just good old stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not the stupid good like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood's movies, it's probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. Giving this film a golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. To say that this movie is silly is shocking even for idiots. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, it would be better to start World War III at the same time and let the roaches launch the show afterwards. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my bachelor .... <br /> <br /> It's a great movie if you're suicidal.
