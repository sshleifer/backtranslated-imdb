Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this film spoke neither of anything, nor of new, at least. After 10 to 15 minutes, you realize that you have just paid for Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J to recite their way through another detective film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story speaks of the corrupt system of some city, all secretly supported by the base company and in town, under the watchful eye of a politician with a hot gun. The almighty organization and above the law is called FRAT and guess what? they have a crazy cop who shoots and beats at will - suspects, girlfriends, etc. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are discovered by a young and talented journalist (!!!). An hour later, after a series of incredibly poorly made shooting scenes and other stereotypes, everything ends well and we are served on the last line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see this waste of film. Freeman and Spacey have just 10 minutes in total!
