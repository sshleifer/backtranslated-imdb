As a big fan or Cracker series, I was waiting for the next addition for 7 years. I'm afraid this episode is not up to the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for the marriage of his daughter and is involved in an investigation into a murder, a soldier tormented by the returns of his period of service in the north of England. Ireland is a killing. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it's all organized and how Fitz is led to the murderer. Everything is fat to exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There are, however, good scenes in Northern Ireland flashbacks that are filmed in a fantastic way.
