Man, even Plan 9 of space is better than this movie. This film did not have enough ground for half an hour, but they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in exaggerated fight scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are far better than those sorry things that would be best left undone.
