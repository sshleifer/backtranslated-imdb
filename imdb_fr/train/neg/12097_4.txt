I did not expect much when I went to see that. After spending a lot of time on JasonX with friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film took itself too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There is a Legion Ft13e movies that cover this anyway. At the end of the day, he is a dead serial killer, I just will not have that sympathy. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film with his hallucinations and the like, but unfortunately, they were few and at the end of the film, it had degenerated into a bad deathmatch episode with celebrities ... but not funny. <br /> <br />
