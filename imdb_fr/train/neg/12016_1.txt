If Bob Ludlum had to see this mini-series, he would have cried. It was a waste of time and money. I've read the book and even though the movies are not exactly what it may be, CBS has wasted time and money on this and it's embarrassing to say it was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the creator should discover Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how successful this TV series was. <br /> <br /> The poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to bend so low? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
