All you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a soundtrack that reflects the 1960s, and almost all of its characters are inimitable. Once you have received this message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Davies ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life to care about him. Then, at the moment when he takes his advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantastic film of which he is the director imagined - he does it by spreading it and matching it with an actress whom he has idealized without reason. A few laughs and a thoughtful artistic direction are the only things worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as a documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying rudeness was something to overcome, but here is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family ties have clearly earned him this role; hoping that his choices improve.
