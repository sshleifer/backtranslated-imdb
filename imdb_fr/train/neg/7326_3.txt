This movie has an interesting plot, but the acting is pretty bad and the screenplay is mediocre. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but because of poor writing and bad casting, this potentially winning premise is looted. After about 45 minutes, two of the other four people in the theater left and the other two made fun of the film. I held it to the end, but I must admit that I played blackjack on my cellphone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
