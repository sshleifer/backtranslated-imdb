I could not not recommend more a Christmas movie than this worthless piece (believe me, double negatives are needed here - it's so bad). This film was in trouble from the beginning credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The music numbers are all too long and none of them are good ("Thank you very much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would wear Scrooge's strings in the bizarre sequence of the film's hell to witness this insult to musicals again. <br /> <br /> The only fun part of this film (completely unintentional by the way) involves Alec Guinness like Jacob Marley. Dressed in a stupid white powder suit, Guinness ruthlessly advances in his scenes, trying either to make him feel like a ghost or to show his absolute disdain for being in this horrible film. Albert Finney, meanwhile, combines the best of Alistar Sim with Charles Laughton to create his desperately repugnant Quasimodo / Scrooge character. Finney's Scrooge is such a hideous person that it's impossible to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs this abomination of cinema.
