Just a scam on the infinitely better "Murder, she wrote," it is absolutely amazing that this badly written trash lasted eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this crap without interest were between sixty and seventy and were listening because they had nothing better to do, or just remembered his star from old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who had a decent career in the 1960s, was never an actor (by his own admission) and he was already too old to play doctor when the series started in 1993. He looks like absolutely ancient result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking. His lifeless son in real life, Barry, a wooden actor who rarely played in activities that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
