I'm a fan of Shakespeare and I can understand what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back into a new generation of viewers. However, this film fails to convey the overall intentions of the play with ridiculous music sequences. Add to that Alicia Silverstone who stumbles over dialogue (which reminds Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other misinterpreted roles, equates to an unbearable endurance.
