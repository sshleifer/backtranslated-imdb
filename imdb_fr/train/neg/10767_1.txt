This is not only the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in British Columbia, but also the worst, which never sees the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and it shows. We are all made to be a gang of devils and stupid hyper-sexed dope. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is missing, and that's supposed to be the reason we're funding that crap. Of course, the British character is normal. The others are a series of stereotypes on the sitcom - can you say "Norm !!"? Cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to glaucous indoor silhouettes. The actors always seem to be overwhelming. Are they bored as much as the viewer or is it the idea of ​​director of the cinema? Avoid this mess and watch some of Bruce Mcdonalds' movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to say in the movies. You will not be forced out of his movies after 10 minutes.
