Grand Central Murder (1942) Director: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre mystery of "B" is one of five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. He surely could have included one or two other Red Skelton films in his program! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a cheeky scam of Thin Man's movies minus the spirit, charm and chemistry of the main roles. We are treated for a thin plot like paper that barely withstood its 73 minutes, bad actions and tired gags. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Charder, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and research partner. They engage in "humorous" jokes with each other. See? It's completely different already. Heflin is the only one here to refer to bigger and better things, although he is about to become a fool. Virginia Gray was in Another Thin Man, but again, let me emphasize that THIS FILM CAN NOT BE SO THAT, no sir. And just in case we start thinking that this movie does not look like another movie (say, THE THIN MAN) that we really like, Sam Levene appears as the main detective who is rather weak and has to let Van Heflin lead him subtly to all the important tracks. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, the "murder" is that of the intrepid colic Mida King, who likes to talk with rich men to find a richer one. It's played by Patricia Dane, who looks like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into F. There is a whole range of zany suspects, all motivated by wanting the death of Mida. There is the type of society, the ladies who speak loudly, the thug, the ex-lover, and a shady theater impresario (Tom Conway, here decked with the unlikely name of the character of Frankie Ciro). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous and nervous type, which I think he may have already done. Millard Mitchell is an idiotic cop who can not stop thinking about the impasse he has been waiting for since the end of the affair (that's right, Millard Mitchell, the swordsman). Finally, in a totally innovative storytelling method, something we've never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in a place where they tell their stories (like flashbacks) to the detective, as Rocky notes, up to that the guilty party is obliged to reveal confessions in a dramatic way. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual image, I naively thought there might be some shots of the Great Real from Central 1942, but alas, no. There is simply a very brief shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to summarize, a slightly light formula, but Heflin was not serious. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
