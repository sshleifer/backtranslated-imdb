As a fan of Altman, I've been looking for this movie for years, thinking that with such a nice cast, it should be at least slightly shiny. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's big hodgepodge, randomly and improvised (or at least, depending on how he feels about it) in the hope that everything will happen. will meet in the editing room. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is only remarkable for the first performance of Alfre Woodard, which surpasses the veterinarians all around her. But apart from that, avoid at all costs. (Which is quite easy to do - to my knowledge, has never been published on video - and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
