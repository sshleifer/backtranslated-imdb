I am the guy who usually keeps the opinions for him, but I just got back from this movie and I felt that I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a huge horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I like to see even a little bit of good script and character development. I know they often miss horror movies, but Prom Night seemed to have made NO effort in this department. Then we all love the suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night did not have anything of that! Of course, we love a terrifying killer. Prom Night has that? No, he has a pretty boy with a cute little knife. And when all else fails ... at least the horror has its guilty pleasure to make it nice like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a PG-13 horror movie like Prom Night, they leave that too. So with all these missing elements, I ask ... does it always count as a horror movie? Nope. I would call it more than a comedy. The people in my theater laughed more than I did when I saw "Semi-Pro" which was supposed to be a comedy (which was also bad, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up the new horror. All the good horror movies of the good old days have been redone in the trash so that movie studios can make money. The people I went with did not even know it was a remake! What drove me crazy! I wonder what will happen when there will be more films to do again ??? Where will the horror go ???
