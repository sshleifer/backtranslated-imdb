My wife and I have just finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the film. I really wanted to fall asleep with her, but the misfortune is that the voice of the main character is so loud and squeaky that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I was hoping he would get on a bus five minutes after the movie started. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes really does not make any sense damn at all. If you want good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid The Booth as the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
