All this film should have lasted 45 minutes maximum. Although this is an interesting concept / theme, it has not been developed as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) Is introduced and that happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitive. Characters have not been explored, and aspects of place and politics have been ignored. There was a good idea of ​​the horrendous difficulties faced by the troops in such a foreign environment and the difficulties of differentiation between friends and foes. But the way the unit worked exercised its convictions! Individual performances were good and the special effects were adequate, but not sufficient to overcome the fundamental lack of content.
