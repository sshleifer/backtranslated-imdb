This film is very very very poor. I saw better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a little tension but not much to make you jump from your chair. It starts slowly with the construction of the tension. Which is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although, at times or times, I have to say it was a bit funny to see people being shot at and how they failed. <br /> <br /> They should have done something similar to Scary Movie, so it might be a better movie. Because I only watched pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it became boring throughout the movie. I must say that I felt sleepy watching this movie, so I can say that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time thinking about doing something with this movie in addition to leaving it where it is already. . Somewhere very dusty ..
