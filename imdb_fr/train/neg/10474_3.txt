The Omega code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was a little (but not much) good acting, mostly from the two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, the acting was decidedly bad. The plot was rather weak and rested only partially on a biblical interpretation already questionable. Certainly not one of the best of the year.
