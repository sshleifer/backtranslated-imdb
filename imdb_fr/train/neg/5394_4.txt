I am irritated by the modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director can not decide whether to use the original or update it. If you use the original words in an updated setting, this is particularly difficult if you are in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work with vintage styles, for example the game Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night from the end of the Victorian era is very effective. This could work with the 1930s setting if there had been far fewer songs and dances and many more Shakespeare lyrics. Unfortunately, it ends up being a rather trivial but very pleasant show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is far too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is an experienced Shakespearean actor who, despite all his efforts to become a student, his acting strength shows all the time. Of course, he should have played the king - no problem to have an adult student king surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a nice but unimportant actor for the king, so a so-called king without royal attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious in spite of pleasant songs and pleasant dances, unfortunately meant that the great Shakespearian dialogue was to be radically interrupted. So it all ended up being a trivial and sweet confectionery, and I got bored a lot, even with the comical turns, and I was happy when it ended. Branagh did not do justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, just as beautiful as the older couple.
