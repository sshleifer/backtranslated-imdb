1st viewed 17/05/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): A rather lame report of the disaster of the Titanic is the first filmed version of this event so much announced. The replica of the disaster is not bad, but the tragedy that takes place there sometimes resembles nonsense, unhealthy acts and serials too much resembling. The story is very similar to that of the most recent Oscars, except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the disaster that took place until almost too late. Good for the purpose of nostalgia only and to get an idea of ​​what James Cameron was competing (barely ??) in his spare time.
