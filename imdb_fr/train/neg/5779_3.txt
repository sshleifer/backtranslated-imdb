I saw this movie a few days ago ... What was it? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. When I saw a name of this title and that kind, I thought it was great, it could be really good ... a parody of slashers or another movie gore ... but ... then j have read a preview and thought it could be good anyway ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: if, like the movies, they look like a little to documentary, try a little comedy to try Moore's films or Alien's autopsy, they really have something. this one was empty. <br /> <br /> and put on a comedy ... no comment ... really bad joke
