it's the result. A piece of trash film that does not even deserve to be classified as a movie, it's just a lot of things on a movie reel, that makes no sense. Let's go back to the actors, who from the outset seem to be just a group of friends who thought they would raise some money and try to make a film that would be an excellent horror film. Anyway, it's a big horror, it does not matter. "Hobgoblins" is a dreadful acting game, but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who is far too weak to be considered a root. Well, when you start a group of friends and you try to make the movie scary, with a minimal budget, nothing, nothing less, that's what will happen. Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But it's still a horrible movie, which deserves all the heckling it gets. 9 for the MST version.
