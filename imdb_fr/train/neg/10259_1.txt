I saw this film in the cinema when I was a kid and I always remember it as my first experience of being ripped off by a horrible movie with good publicity. The advertisement was excellent, but I later learned that it had all the explosions or all the "special effects" of the whole movie (about 4) and even others that were not in the movie. There was a kind of plot about extraterrestrials but aliens were never shown in the movie as far as I can remember. It was clearly someone who was winning a cheap movie designed to rip people off. I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I discovered that there were bad guys doing bad movies.
