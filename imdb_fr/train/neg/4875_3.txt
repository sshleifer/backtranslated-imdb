My grandmother and my sister took us to see this movie when it was released in theaters in 1998. So we bought the tickets, the popcorn and the soda, and we went straight to the movies and sat down to watch the movie. movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud very loudly, I remember hearing some people say that they did not like it at all, that I did not like it, that I found it rather stupid and that was not worth it. seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the roles, I also remembered that other people in the theater almost did not laugh. And what I really thought was bad was to make animals talk, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in action movies, they're totally stupid! I said that, apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist, this movie is not worth watching, it's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in several movies and I thought he was funny Those, I just said it was the only fun part of this movie, I did not Nor did Eddie Murphy appear in the very "big" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie I really recommend to watch because, apart from Eddie Murphy, you're probably not going to like it, especially because of the talking animals! <br /> <br /> I will give this film 3 out of 10 possible stars.
