I remember taking advantage of that a few years ago, but I wonder why. I guess it always looks good and the girls are doing pretty well but men prefer to drop the side. Why oh why in so many English films about sex, should we have such incompetent men alongside pretty girls? What's more, it starts predictably as a sexual farce similar to the Confessions movies but about a third of the way (as we start to appreciate the presence of the beautiful Me Me Lai), the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that, but central rock club and cannabis sequences are highly forced and just air on stilts. In short, this is neither as innocently stupid nor as cleverly serious as it seems to be. Richard O'Sullivan may have been able to help as a central character, but I think this is one of his worst performances. It's worth it for the ladies.
