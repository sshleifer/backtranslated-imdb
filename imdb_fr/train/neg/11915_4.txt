This obvious pilot for a non-produced television series introduces young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby into an amnesia with incredible powers that must be exploited when a demon turned man in flight unleashes the world. The CGI is comparable to a television set, and Appleby agrees as amnesiac but difficult to swallow as a superheroine. The familiar face of television, Richard Burgi, is Appleby's mentor, but he can do nothing to raise that level above the mediocre. We see far too many caricatured flying demons from the beginning, which is a bad sign. In addition, the scenes where Burgi trains Appleby in action are really laughable. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, including REMO WILLIAMS.
