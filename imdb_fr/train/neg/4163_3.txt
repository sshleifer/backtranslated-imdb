I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their version of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically found excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production formats, and so on. - simply emphasizes the gravity of this film. And my criticisms in the panning are not directed personally but simply a warning that this one does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It's observable, but hardly. There are holes in the plot in every corner, the dialogue borders on ridicule and the end is telegraphed a kilometer away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram that interacts with a reconnaissance team is drowned in an idiotic dialogue, like the one who prepares a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you blow us a Hamburger Helper Sally between us being killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gadgets and red plastic miracle armor does not have access to MRE. Once in the last rooms, they treat this place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting place. <br /> <br /> The reason for the meeting with the dreaded Rook is that he can not be killed on his own. . Yet, there is only one scene, the hero who defended this case abandoned King to do just that. Huh? Vivian Woo was seductive and was undoubtedly the best-played character of the movie. But it does not say much.
