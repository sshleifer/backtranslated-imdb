It is rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of the poor quality of its creation and the bias of its product. <br /> <br /> I felt a distinct attempt on the part of filmmakers to portray the Palestinian family as heroic and untrustworthy. We hear them talking about the sadness they feel because of oppression. However, the film was shot and arranged in such a way that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We do not see any evidence parallel to the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear other Palestinians in prison. I understand that restrictions are in place, but the political nature of these restrictions is to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of the movie thinking that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely closed-minded. because of his side of the fence, so to speak. She continued not to want to see the wound of the kamikaze's parents, and her angry, closed-minded words provoked an uncontrollable spiral from the last meeting. In my mind, it is more realistic to see the Israeli mentality at the root of the problem; ignored the calls for understanding and freedom, ignored the requests for recognition for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I gave him both because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother that would normally be admirable in a documentary, however, in light of the lack of impartiality, all this seems to be exploitation. Also for the poor editions, the lack of background in the present case and finally the lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. In the end, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I recognize that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to note the steering defects regardless of the heartbreaking and sad subject.
