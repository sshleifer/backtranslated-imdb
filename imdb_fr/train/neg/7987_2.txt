I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" Epcot opened in 1982, but now it's silly. The message of the film is clich√©. The vision of the circle is disorienting. And that terrible song in the end is raspy. And I would really like them to install seats. After having walked so much, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when we hear a movie, it looks very glamorous! You have fun sitting down, right? FALSE! You stay there for more than 18 minutes, leaning against a small railing. Disney should make a new Maelstrom as an attraction to enliven things and replace this dull and dull film. NOT FUNNY. Jump. In fact, avoid Canada if you do not eat it. Move directly to the UK.
