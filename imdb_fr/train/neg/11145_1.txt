Where to start? . . . I feel violated! That's right, violated! I just spent an hour and a half of my life doing something more useful, like watching dry, what's called a horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's nothing, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> C ' is predictable, it's boring, it's tragic ... <br /> <br /> I could come a little hard here, but watch this movie and you'll feel the same way ... or. .. no, do not look at it ... unless you want to feel violated too.
