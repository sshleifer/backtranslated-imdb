"The Leap Years" is a film adapted from an electronic novel by Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, which became the first Singaporean novel / novel to be sold on the Internet. The film had a twisted post-production schedule: shot in early 2005, it was scheduled for release in late 2005, but will only be released three years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year. <br /> <Before I say anything, I must first admit that I'm not a fan of the novel genre, so I may be a bit biased towards this film - I just watched it because it was a Singapore production and is available for borrowing from the library in my neighborhood. Here are my two cents on the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start by saying that apart from the KS of Qi Yu-wu and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here seems to be a Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the trio of friends of Wong is all composed of Eurasians. Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with Eurasians is more "in" than ordinary Chinese (or the Asian race that you are?). I do not know, it seems to be that way. Plus, everyone in the movie speaks with a mystical "anglified" accent that does not exist anywhere, and certainly not in Singapore. This is the kind of "almost perfect English" that the authorities would like us to talk about, but that does not exist anywhere else, for example on the MTV channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film seems forced and scalded, and that the lack of Singaporeans in real blue in the casting does not help anything. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter seems to be trying too hard to force the liners one line. After twenty minutes, "the spirit" of the film begins to fade and the film begins to serve its usual plate of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I guess I did not like the movie because the basic principle of a romantic relationship for 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other disbeliefs in the movie. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall for one of Wong's friends. And the scene where the husband says "Go, before I change my mind" has been used in a hundred television series from East Asia (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. .) ... <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The value of the production is fair and Wong Li-lin does his best, but the script does not help him. Joan Chen has a 15-minute role in the film as an old Wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot, but, hey, her role is just a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you come across "leap years" in the rental or library, you can insert it into the DVD player out of curiosity, but otherwise you can decide if you do not like really the romantic kind, or not.
