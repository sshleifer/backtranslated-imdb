I had it like a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Interpretation - although many have already played in other films, it is clear that they have had to work hard to make this work so consistently film without accidentally slipping a certain degree of action. <br /> <br /> Intrigue - be generous I could say that the screenwriter started with a plot but did his best to ignore it. the plot collapsed faster than a Chinese computer hit <br /> <br /> Scrip - it was now an abomination of nature. he failed with no rhyme or reason. the majority of the characters' lines were at best pathetic to fools. the script worked hard to make sure no characters managed to be considered memorable. I watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Achievement - until you can create your own directing ability, copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you will only make such failures. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family have awarded you 10 stars for this movie
