Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in the script, too short, appeared on a budget. Not enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I'm sure makeup did the best to hide it. I guess they did not want to stop filming until everything was healed, pity. Most likely why this movie lacked scenes of kisses. A single scene of disappointing kisses at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and must be told true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more faithful to the book.
