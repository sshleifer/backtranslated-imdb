This film stinks. I do not think I have ever seen a film so suspended with shock value. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the acting was bland. It could have been a good movie. I think he was content with grotesque visuals. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but I had the impression that Miike had photographed it to do it. Just a poorly executed movie. This film is not entertaining unless it is fascinated by scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-trafficking, parental and parental violence and stool dispersion. I think I just sold the movie to a lot of you, but I meant when I said it stinks. He did well in other movies, but I think you'd better watch someone poop.
