When I heard the plot for this movie, I just had to see it, I mean entire cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is about as funny as it gets. <br /> <br /> Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never takes off his scuba gear and Lieutenant Finletter who 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B-Movies, especially the Japanese horror of the 1950s. The film begins with the discovery of a standard size tomato by a woman who dives into her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of "a crime scene, because the tomato supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you that it will not be healthier as the film goes forward! To be honest, there are a few moments For example, every time the Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed with an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes, "Hey, can anyone pass the ketchup?" same, this movie was probably a lot more role in 1978 with all that badly its good concept. Unfortunately for "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes", parody movies such as "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series have been released and have made this kind of comedy much better since. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious; there is no continuity in the editing and you feel really slow and without energy. For a parody film to work, it takes a lot of things to happen at the same time, one gag after another. The song in the movie seems useless and the ads for the furniture store that scroll on the screen are really weird, even for this film. In the end, though, you can understand why this movie is a cult. I do not see many indifferent people. Unfortunately, that would be the way I would summarize the situation.
