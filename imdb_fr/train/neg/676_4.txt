I wanted to see him for two reasons. First, it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, secondly, the role of Bogart was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with a certain subtlety, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But I wonder now. why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; Only here, the actors do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance gets bored watching Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters wonders what she's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! Surely they could have come up with different ideas. Maybe the color makes it nice to see the same place where they shot High Sierra, but it does not add any quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-black film. For my part, I would rather die than to see him again ...
