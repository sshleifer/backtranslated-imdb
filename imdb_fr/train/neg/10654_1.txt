Big hair, big tits, bad music and giant security pin ... These are the words that best describe this terrible movie. I love horror movies and I've seen hundreds of movies. But it must be one of the worst ever. The plot is thin and ridiculous, the acting is an abomination, the scenario is completely laughable (the best is the final clash with the cop and how he determined who the killer is - it's so terribly written terribly) , the clothes are disgusting and funny in equal equals, the hair is big, a lot of breasts are bouncing, the men are wearing these cut T-shirts that show their stomach (disgusting that the men have really worn them !!) and the music is just a synthesizer basket that plays on it and again ... in almost every scene, there is trash music, breasts and paramedics who remove bodies ... and the gym still does not close for mourning !! Joking aside, this is a really bad movie whose only charm is to go back to the disaster of the 80s and have laughed at how good everything was at the time.
