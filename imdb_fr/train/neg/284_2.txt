Only today I picked up this at the 99-cent store only today, and I still think I got scammed. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastic drama and $ 1 is too expensive for that. This film is probably only remarkable for two things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It is directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also participated in Promo Night. Now on the film. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who is seriously injured in a car accident that also cost her father's life. Thus, the accident prevents her from participating in gymnastics tournaments, she is often chosen during her classes and meets a wild child named Tommy (played by Keanu.) Robin does not work in training and works part-time with his mother. and half-sister, in a laundromat owned by her violent stepfather. Finally, she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevents me from giving this star to 1 star. It's also not one of the worst movies in history, but far from good. The DVD itself gets no medals because it seems to come from an old VHS. In the end, the sound is no longer synchronized and when the final credits are almost finished, it goes black, even if the sound can still be. heard. So, this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD illustration does not make sense either, because it contains what seems to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the film because it does not appear no longer in the film itself. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you are a Keanu fanatic. I will probably not hang on to it anymore. I'll probably give that to The Cinema Snob, which is a very good review of YT. Hey, if you have bad movies that they do not want in front of them, do not hesitate to give him a donation so that his show continues to turn.
