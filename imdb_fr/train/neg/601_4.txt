!!!!! Of course, there is spoiler !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screenwriting workshop to avoid clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check out Bad things happen to drug addicts - Check that Heorine puts it on naughty to death - Check that Heroine does not notice that the villain recovers his unconscious - sequence, so we see the villain found crawling behind the heroine - Check Unfortunately, it seems that someone sent this list of shots to a studio of cinema instead of using it in class. Dear oh if only London transport was as regular as the pictures here. In fact, there are so many clichés and worries that no one has really decided to go into the details of what the gloating eponymous is or how long it has been killing people in hiding. I am led to believe that it is the result of a human experience and it is perhaps not until that night that he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that he does not want to say anything. Not to be totally negative, I doubt that the producers thought they would shoot a film that would sweep the Oscars that year and that there is always a market for horror movies. Similarly, I doubt that it is too expensive and that we have an eye on the DVD market rather than the movie distribution and I will say that it is slightly better than the 1972 DEATH LINE, which also proposed a murderer Cannibal hidden in the London Underground. it's just that when you think that all the clichés were used in this movie, another cliche comes up to raise its ugly head
