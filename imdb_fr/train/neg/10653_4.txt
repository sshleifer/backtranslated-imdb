One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. It is a must, first of all to see the work. There is a lot of work shown, see these close-ups, dude, you'll enjoy it. A few years ago, a video clip was surely based on this film. It's a slasher but without suspense. The end is funny too, and the clothes she wears in the wood facing the copper, Jesus, look like a clown. The killings are usually done off screen, the blood flows but never too bloody. There are a lot of fight scenes too, and hey, nobody was hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, I've never seen one as big, it will not spoil it, you have to see it. And as a slasher, there is also a lot of T & A. To guess who the killer is, you'll be trapped several times and that's the best part, but what about the history of copper in the woods, huh! But still because of her cheesiness, this one is always the one that many would like to have. I'm happy to have my copy, one of those slasher chess. But dude, these clothes and hairstyles! If you are over 40, it's a return to memory.
