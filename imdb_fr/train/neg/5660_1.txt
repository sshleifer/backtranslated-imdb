I am happy to read so many negative comments on Tritter's plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They love House's burdensome nature and intelligence, but really hate the vindictive nature of this ongoing plot. This reduces the real nature of the hospital's story and makes everyone angry at the authority of the police. He must have a more caring nature instead of being vindictive towards everyone in the hospital. In addition, there seem to be many dubious legalities in what Tritter actually does. He alone can not freeze accounts and have the power to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the vengeance he shows also shows hurting sick patients in the hospital and it's not a good story to describe. I judged the episode horrible not because of the story itself, but when you insert the piece of Trittor, it disables me and the rest of the plot suffers, people say they hate to watch the story lines. Please change. Take out Tritter.
