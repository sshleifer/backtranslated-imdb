This film was recently released on DVD in the United States and I finally had the chance to see this jewel difficult to find. He even came up with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, previews were the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is strangely related to Lucio Fulci's infamous franchise "ZOMBIE" which began in 1979. In the same way as "ZOMBIE" "," ZOMBI 3 "consists of a plot worn and in a handful of extremely bad actors who keep this trash of "horror" barely afloat.The gore is almost nonexistent (unless you are frightened by people running with green moss on the face) and the English dubbing is an awkward underhand. <br /> <br /> The plot this time involves some kind of secret military operation with a group of incompetent scientists (ie a silly man and her female idiot) who develop a kind of chemical called "Death One" that is supposed to revive the dead.Unless my ears need to be checked, I do not even remember a REASON for the search for "Death One." This seems to exist only to sow chaos over the poor I have made the mistake of choosing to play the lead role in this film festival laughter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Death One" is experienced on a corpse (that I swear it looked like Yul Brynner), and after the injection into his system, he sits down and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilarious: when the corpse's face is bubbling with green slime, the sound of "crumpled paper" can be heard. The "Death One" toxin is carried outside and is captured by a group of thieves who run away, but become infected after cutting themselves on an exposed bottle. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before escaping into a cheap motel, he infects a humble doorman and kills a maid by pushing her into a mirror of bathroom (!). The military is aware of this and immediately took action to "eliminate" those who have the misfortune of being in the "contamination zone" and to turn the motel upside down. They find the thief infected and burn his body, but the smoke infects a flock of birds flying over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the military, listening to 'groovy music' coming out of a small music box while shuffling a trailer of slutty girls leaning out the window and showing their breasts. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that were infected with "zombie" smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl goes to a deserted petrol station to search for water. This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. She walks around the old, rusty and obviously abandoned building where she keeps asking aloud, "HELLO, is there anyone here?" PLEASE, I NEED WATER " She meets a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall (!) And the other is swinging with a machete. After a bit of roar and tumble on the ground, she escapes but not before exploding the gas station with her lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the whore trailer and a girl is pecking and infected. They all arrive at the same motel where the original infection took place, and that's where the hilarious second moment of the movie takes place. After a few hours (maximum one day), the same motel is now covered with dust, covered with vines and seems to have been abandoned for years. Anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to break down as several people move away together to find themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third hilarious moment is about a man and a woman exploring an abandoned village, whose wife comments, "THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!" Then she gets pushed by a zombie from a balcony in a water infested with pirahna (?) Where she gets bitten legs and turns into a zombie in seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who got bitten and infected HOURS earlier is still zombie TURNING! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film contains too many inconsistencies that make it too stupid to say it. . For example, the time spent zombifying infected people is very different. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk very slowly. Some even make kung-fu movements, while others hide under piles of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even speak! The funniest moment is of course the infamous "zombie head in the refrigerator gag" that "rises" in the air and "attacks" a stupid man looking for food. Funny thing, his girlfriend is slaughtered by his counterpart "headless" (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me however was the lack of stories involving the people who live there. killed by zombies. We never see them coming back like zombies. In fact, the only ones we see "zombified" are those pecked by birds and the girl who gets her legs bitten. Apart from that, I was expecting at least that the couple killed in the kitchen and / or the guy killed on the deck come back in the form of zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies take only "a few bites" before moving on to their next victim. <br /> <br /> The most laughable moment of course was the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected is lying on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" tries to give birth to the baby (!) And is shot by a zombie, before being pushed in the woman's belly where a hand bursts and tears rest of his face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all characters are perfect stereotypes of this kind. The megalomaniac military officer, the pathetic useless screaming women who scream for kill, the obvious characters who are about to get killed (ie watch the man chasing a chicken!) I guess this movie is really a comedy. There were a lot of ludicrous scenes, like the hangar exploding with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man shouted: "I AM SO ... BLOOD!" . The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the movie, wearing the same "Asian" garment that can be found in a Bruce Lee movie, and pay attention to the blue skirt of the '60s that the girl the motel is dressed when she and her boyfriend collide with the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open as usual for the apocalyptic scenario. A radio DJ who tells the story throughout the movie turns out to be a zombie and warns his listeners of the "beginning of the end" as the two survivors take off in a helicopter. It's hardly if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie gives a lot of laughs. The gore is minimal, and what gore it is, it is very unconvincing, even less unimaginable. The usual mixture of black blood, thick green oozing drops from crying wounds and "zombie makeup" made of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" is a good rental for a night out with friends or a night of beer and popcorn. Apart from this, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
