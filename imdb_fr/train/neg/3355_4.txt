This film left me interested only in two things: I was waiting for the death of Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> It was essentially a female show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to give some candy. Liam Neeson was totally lost in this movie. Like Jones, he had no role. The movie was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one to have had a real role in David Self's shit script. OK, it was his first and he bought himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the problem was with director Jan de Bont. he did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. he really fell to work here. Perhaps he was still recovering from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
