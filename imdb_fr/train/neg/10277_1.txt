I feel totally scammed. Someone must repay the $ 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. It's not a musical, it's a waste of time and my evening. What I do not understand is why was this distribution distributed in the first place? I saw better films coming out of film schools and I went to film school to be able to say it. The quality of this work is also SO DIFFICULT to see ... shot in DV ??? Said Nuff. The songs are not songs but just jokes that sound the same way in each section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT THIS FILM.
