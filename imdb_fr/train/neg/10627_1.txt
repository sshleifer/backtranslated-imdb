I notice that most people who think this film is telling the truth are not born before the moon landing (1969-1972) or are not old enough to enjoy it. I think it's much easier to question a historical event if you do not live it. <br /> <br /> I was a kid in the Apollo era, but I was old enough to understand what was happening. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the television to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines shouted the latest news every day, from launch to landing, from moonrise to crush, in a multitude of languages. At school, some classes have been canceled so we can watch the main events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held its breath as the men returned home from an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere without someone asking what was the last one. The world was really a community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a payback of about thirty years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because the enthusiasm and the interests of the whole world have died out. We still have our history books, and everyone can pretend that the story is false and try to "prove it" with a lot of lies and facts invented while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing the opposite - without talk about the evidence that dwells in the souls and memories of those who have lived these wonderfully intoxicating and fantastic days.
