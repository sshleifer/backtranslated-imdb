One of the lamer wedding movies you will see. He feels too much of his period, so it was obsolete before its release in theaters. Ethnic stereotypes sound like a joke from Henny Youngman, except that they are not very funny here. Molly Ringwald, well what else has to be said. Give her a clue about stupidity, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress because "it just will not be me" is part of this rag, with suspenders and a top hat, her head in the neck. It's a cast too, check out Ally Sheedy's weight. Wheeeew!
