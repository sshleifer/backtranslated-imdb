Naturally, I did not look at 'GI Jane' by choice. I was more or less forced to watch this film around the house of my ex-girlfriend. <br /> <br /> GI Jane immediately loses credibility by trying to convince the viewer that this was potentially a real scenario, which of course. is not. As a result, the story automatically becomes bound by constraints, limiting the amount of humor (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and quickly becomes too serious. The film becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> "GI Jane" fails where other action movies are successful, mainly because films like James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are larger than life without ever claiming to be otherwise . They are an escape, and therefore entertaining. 'GI Jane' is trying to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with a very unlikely scenario, a banal roleplaying game, and the only reason I present it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work.
