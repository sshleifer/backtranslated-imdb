This film does well, but combines action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that moves more public emotion than a typical horror film. Unfortunately, with his disjointed stories, his frustrating intrigues and his contradictory scenes, this film has mainly caused me frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster film of all time". <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning, this film begins at a frantic and brazen pace. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is camper and fast, paying tribute to the classic ecological disasters that gave birth to so many other monsters. The pace is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often useless opening scene of other monster movies and allows the movie to jump right into the action. In 10 minutes, you get the "why", the "where" and the "how" of the beast and are ready to take action. In this film, the film is presented. <br /> <br /> After another brief and well-filmed sequence, the characters are presented: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, the nice grandfather and the talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster . The characters are presented in context and their conflicts are immediately apparent, allowing the audience to feel how they feel when the monster suddenly comes to chaos in the area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster itself looks great: a stranger yet familiar - a bit like a dog and a fish poop by a squid. The effects of the creature are incomparable and although it sounds strange, it's believable and at no point in the movie, you could "see that these are strings". Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a rottweiler growing and excited on the linoleum, the monster drums passing through the crowd, slipping on the surfaces, crushing and devouring those in its path. When the path of the monster merges with the family and tragedy ensues, it is truly a painful moment. You may feel the need for revenge, but from that moment the attraction of the movie begins to crumble. <br /> <br /> After the start of dynamite the film quickly loses focus and continuity. The intrigues are introduced, then abandoned, the characters change position for no apparent reason and the comedy is intertwined in confusing dramatic scenes, while the obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /> <br /> Regarding comedy, let me say this: I'm willing to accept the fact that a lot of humor is probably cultural. I do not know Korean humor, so maybe things have been lost in the translation. However, as a major student in Asia and living in Japan for 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I have a better understanding of Asian humor than ordinary White. That being said, many parts of the movie were supposed to be funny, but not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack during which the girl is lost , the family is in the funeral; everyone is in mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension increases especially as it becomes apparent that the two brothers disagree. They both begin to feel the sorrow of their loss and end up fighting over those who suffer the most. This competition is fundamentally fun: two brothers who hate each other so much that they even argue over a funeral - it shows the pungent nature of the family love that characterizes Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy that mocks family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny, but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the holes of the plot. There are so many points raised in this film that are never explained, or, worse, that are explained and criticized to end up being powerless and useless in the end. Discovering that an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you can expect comments on this nature. Instead, the public is bombarded with anti-climax moments where the problems are "no longer" and no one suggests that this is a problem to be solved. I ask you why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> This was spread throughout the film because the problems posed new problems, and suddenly, the film world is filled with opposing forces that have never resolved. Of course, introducing new and larger problems is a proven tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc results in the forced shortening of another, you would at least expect the new arc to get a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it's as if you had several stories, each explaining only 20% of the way and, finally, the parts never converge to complete the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept that a lot of this could be "cultural". It may be in Korean tradition to put comedy into a tragedy. Perhaps it is normal for stories to be repeated as a child who colors every line out of lines, but never ends one. Perhaps it is acceptable to present a problem in order to develop the plot and then delete it at random, without apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe they are all marks of sloppy work and bad stories in a film that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
