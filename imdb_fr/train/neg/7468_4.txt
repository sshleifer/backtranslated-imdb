Probably the only thing that got me the movie four is the fact that I like Peter Falk. One of the greatest painters in the world of clumsy incompetence. . . and yet, it is one of the only anchors that prevents it from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops Romano, he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan's maniacal madness. Richard Roundtree also offers respectable performances as a worried boss, Vinessa Shaw as an FBI talented agent bouncing in front of a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as an advisor to Falk and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> The concept of intrigue actually has wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could have been a great comic vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just provides a confused mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who represent his unsuitable brothers, are far from having the capabilities they have shown. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are far too few and too boring. What I really miss is what has always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" of mind on the slapstick. No cultural reference that only adults get. . no double meaning. . it's silly. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, that does not mean that I recommend it to your 9 years, because we hope they have a better taste and less fascination for some of their body parts and their functions.
