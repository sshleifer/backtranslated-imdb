Despite his impressive cast and team pedigree, Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot is unrealistic, the actors have bad accents and the participation of the director Robert Altman is equivalent to collect a paycheck. Once again, he has assembled an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) which, this time to the letter, is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a very influential lawyer from Georgia, who, in the heavy opening scenes of the film, manages to be seduced absurdly by a mysterious waitress of the catering company who convinces him is in grave danger of an ex-husband and a crazy father. With red flags everywhere, the astute lawyer even manages to get his children harmed. Punching and punching fights followed, followed by a car chase and, if that was not enough, a hurricane hit the ridiculous finale. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with a wacky and unconvincing southern accent. Running in a trench coat in any weather, he is blind to the obvious so that the story continues. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is just as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the wrong accent. Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely have all grown crazier than a bed bug that served thick slices of ham, but at least his twang is plausible. The women leaders (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are lean and light. Even celebrities who make cameos (Vernon Jordan) are made of wood with the few lines they have at their disposal. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying little attention to his actors, the staging of Altman, dripping with Spanish moss, is cloudy and shapeless, his comic strip of action scenes. He misses his retouching and his offbeat observations (he informs the viewer that stars and bars are always sign in Georgia) that make a Altman well done unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman at its worst, even though the salary is the same.
