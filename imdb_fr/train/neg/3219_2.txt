Someone called Howard Koch schlockmeister but he wrote the script for "Casablanca", did not he? Or is not it? Maybe there is more than one Koch in Hollywood, and I do not like "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there's another Howard Koch slipping around Hollwyood. He is the one who wrote "Casablanca". It does not matter. I will put as much care in this commentary as "Howard W. Koch" in this production, that is to say only a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know what it looks like? Someone read Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, given that no original idea was on board the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and to Hollywoodise it with an end happy. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast estates between three sisters and asks them, before doing so, how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go to the opera on Lear. But in the room, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to hide the two connivers and deprive the honest girl. He ends up crazy and naked during a gust of wind on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Children can do this to you. (Take my child, for example, after all the efforts I made to raise him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) At the end, everyone dies in the room . <br /> <br /> In the film, of course, the good sister is morose and suicidal, but when she tries to escape, someone interferes and saves her, so the end is more or less happy. It's the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy.
