I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. "The Hurt Locker" has won more "Best Film" awards from critics groups than any other movie this year. However, not only did I not like it, but it was hard for me to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is little intrigue and little character development. They disarm the bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. It's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing is that the camera never stops moving and moves constantly. It is a recent fashion in filmmaking and this is supposed to make it more real because it has an inexpensive documentary aspect. The camera was shaking so much that it made me feel nauseous to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not care about war movies and "The Hurt Locker" is no exception. But you do not have to take my word for it because critics love it.
