I have not been as "lucky" as some commentators of this film: I have never seen anything else of ... will we say ... of a "fruitful" spirit of Sarno. I agree with a lot: some actresses who spend a lot of time with bare breasts and dance (go-go) are not really attractive. I loved Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so simple, she was cute! The acting was rather obsolete, although delivering lines in a second language could have largely explained this problem. Trying to follow the plot was a major chore: was there really? I totally agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not a lot of blood. Yes, if you want GOOD Blood Listening Movies, check out Hammer classics such as "Horror of Dracula" and (my favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> The most humorous (involuntarily) is that A woman doctor is torn off her clothes by a cloud of bats ... you never see! ... the bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Good as a time loser if you accidentally grab it cable here in the Great White North but, for God's sake, do not praise it!
