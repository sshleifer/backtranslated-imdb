Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) were ripped off at the university. Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, but he encourages them to help him score points with Angela (James King), a heartfelt student. -inductive than laugh-inducing. Movie tries to appeal to his target audience with his disgusting gags - but NONE OF THEM WORK. Moreover, it is full of worthless and unattractive characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that he becomes a major factor. The film even tries to use Mamie Van Doren, actress / sexpot of the 50s / 60s, in the most scandalous scene of the film. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> The absolute predictability and waste (again) of veteran comedian Joe Flaherty's talent - when will this guy stop accepting all the roles and doing something Is it worth it worth it? <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive - and deserved better. <br /> <br /> It's worth one. out of ten of me.
