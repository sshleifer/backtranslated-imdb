To be perfectly honest, I have not seen so many Western movies, but I've seen enough to know what's good. It's by far the worst western on the planet today. Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cool movie that everyone would love was slightly, no no, completely delayed! Secondly, at that time, women especially black women were not inclined to wear or use weapons the Asian girl speaks perfect English? If the decor is Western, Asia is not your destination. Finally, the nasty gay girl was too much, the movie was just a shit from the beginning. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not racist or white either, so do not be ticked after reading this, worst blacks presentation I've ever seen!
