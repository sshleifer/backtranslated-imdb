It's not fair that it's a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers are in this film; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie is bad ... big time. This people wastes money in terrible scripts. It's supposed to criticize Mexican society, but we're fed up with this kind of film. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I do not understand. Mexican cinema has big problems if this kind of film continues to play (and to be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Do not believe that this kind of film is well received in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
