I always try to understand if this film made sense. <br /> <br /> For a content supposed to be so "rebel" and "controversial", the elements distributed by Maddox to the students are terribly lame. . Students seem to be easily influenced by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illicitly scribbled on leaflets. Rebels, everyone. <br /> <br /> I guess it would have been too much to ask a teenage rebellion film not to set off a fire alarm in a school. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a "huge fight on the football field" is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> The personalities of the characters seem to vary enormously at random. A football jock that Maddox was fighting over (and then a staple in his face) smiles and apologizes the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that the plot does not reach a real conclusion gives me the impression that the whole could have been integrated in a special half-hour after school. If they had cut out most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
