This movie is just bad. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Now that I've got rid of it, I feel better. This film is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is at his worst cartoon character. Thank God, they killed him. And who wants to see the cameos Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little story about Freddy. We see that he already had a family and we see his abusive and alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything is bad. There are quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is really bad. I spent an hour and a half watching this movie and an hour and a half, I will never come back.
