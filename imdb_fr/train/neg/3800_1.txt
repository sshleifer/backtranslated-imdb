Naming the candidates is very complicated, but Nemesis 2 is my favorite since I see it. It was so funny that we had to rent it again the next day and, again, I laughed so much that I literally rolled on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic".) Throughout the film, a shocking feeling firmly grabs the viewer. I am completely taken aback by the fact that this awkward domestic video has reached the stage of production. It's supposed to be a sequel, but apparently has no connection to the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, even though it took us halfway through the film to stop guessing, with all the muscles and barbaric-nomadic attire! <br /> <br /> This is really not a plot at all, it's just a prolonged chase scene, but it's so slow and foolish that calling it a hunting scene makes it much more interesting that he really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as good considering the quality of it, then the film suddenly ends after a blazing action scene with a lot of gasoline explosions, without ever really explain what it was. Fortunately, it never gets boring, because there is always something silly and tinny! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually boring, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect mix of too much seriousness and unintentional madness. that it's really fun. Rent this movie or buy it yourself, you will not be disappointed!
