Drew Barrymore plays the young Holly Gooding, who settles with budding screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely upsets his life by claiming that his "doppelganger", his devilish twin, is ready to kill her and her family . <br /> <br /> This silly horror movie is a bit difficult to take seriously, though the filmmakers and the actors themselves seem very serious. "Doppelganger" is confused, with an unpleasantly stupid dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will note that the name of the character of Drew is taken from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that the name of the character of Newbern is a game. the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he is trying to rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I guess he deserves a credit for not being quite your typical horror movie - I mean, writer / director Avi Nesher seems to be really interested in his characters and gives his movie more conspiracy than a classic slasher award. <br /> <br /> After a silly villain, explain-all-to-all-the confrontation with the public, the film continues to present a hideous climax that must be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not skimp on the gore. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills his mother in this one. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore shows up shortly before being slaughtered violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very observable and very sexy in this one. Newbern presents himself as a kind "friendly" nice enough. But the highlight of the film should be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an alluring veteran who is very professional in her scene as a former nun who started a sex business over the phone (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is fundamentally undesirable but quite amusing on a sordid and shady little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
