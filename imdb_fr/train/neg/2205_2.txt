This type of plot has a lot of potential, but it was slaughtered here. Honestly, I smelled the cheese at first, but I thought it would be better after the grotesque childbirth. Whoa, I was wrong! Such a mad scientist makes a monster, wants to boast of his old comrades before he kills them, but of course, they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should have counted the number of times the rubber shark mask appeared behind some foliage, but I would most likely have lost count. <br /> <br /> Scroll down to the dripping leg of blood to show us how the shark-man finds people. I hate being spoon-fed with every aspect of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and having been almost killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging through a jungle island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle aged man reciting Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is a place where you will find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can stand to watch this poor excuse for a movie.
