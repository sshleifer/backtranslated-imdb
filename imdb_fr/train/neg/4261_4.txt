Pathetic. That's what happens when the director comes to work just because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, good locations and settings for a film of epic proportions. But the performance, damn! I swear that on some shots, you can see extras on the background look in the camera or watch the actors because no one has told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad that you wonder - are these people real? They could have done more damage by hugging each other. In slow motion scenes, you can see people on the battlefield strolling or just standing up, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground is somehow highlighted. But why? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it looks like random situations in a chronological order, sometimes not even. The dialogues are stupid, the love story is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million euros and a dollar invested on the screen, in the best case, the end result of all this considerable effort is a round and brilliant laser disc in the thin film on the shelf in the video store.
