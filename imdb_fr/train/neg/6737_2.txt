If Deborah Messing was not already chosen for "Grace", it could be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated girl who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she talks about in an article in Time magazine to London for her sister's London wedding . What is the novelty of this plot? <br /> <br /> Neither funny, nor a little romantic, the Wedding Date slips on the story of the deceitful sex on the part of the bride and the best man, and paid the escort for passing the film as Four Marriages Without Hugh, and certainly, a dead-end agreement for the na√Øve groom who ignores the sexual history of his wife (Amy Adams). While Messing perfected the repressed princess, thirty years with a history of failed relationships, her neurotic and drunken movements take another false pretense, it is simply the resumption of her television series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already happening in prime time. <br /> <br /> Many connections between drunk women, jokes about cricket and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), But the movie is a boredom with the obvious happy end. Expected continuation of Messing: Date of divorce.
