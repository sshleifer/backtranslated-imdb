I am a big fan of Troma but I can not understand why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I felt like watching for 3 hours. Some on the summary of the plot, it is written "but what Satan ignores, he is stuck with annoying tourists" Well, they did not seem to bother him in the movie, only me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies but it was boring.
