My summary in one line should explain everything, but I will try. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie seemed to be an excessive soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. . There were some interesting scenes, such as the "Big One" that hit the middle of the film, but wait, what is it? * Earthquake *, wait a minute! It's the peak of Dante! Well, some parts were slaughtered and beaten. I can not believe how badly this film was made, by "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what the director thought the viewers were stupid enough to believe that there are large, mountain-mounted woodlands in downtown Los Angeles at Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak by chance.) <br /> <br />
