When I started watching this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I'm an animation fan and I love this movie when it's merged with live action sequences. However, the animation of this movie was pretty much everything I liked. Although it must be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. The visual aspect - including the animation - made the room look wonderfully confusing. However, it is the quality of the discomfort that has been lost among the exaggerated images, both visual and in the script, with which you have been virtually knocked out. The most embarrassing about it was the relative lack of importance of the plot. It seemed that the plot was taking place at irregular intervals, which produced a stuttering effect that greatly affected the unfolding of the play. Felisberto's voice-over - especially the late one - seemed like a desperate attempt to fill gaping holes in the plot that had been ignored in favor of secondary issues such as the ant problem (and even correctly addressed). I fear that the entire article is, at best, a "first reasonable attempt" by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence. This is not what you expect from experienced filmmakers.
