I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the film is pretty good and allows you to walk about what will happen ... What is nothing. All open stories remain open; two characters who initially seemed to have some importance are completely left out except for one or two very short scenes. I wonder if Ilya would not have done better to leave them completely aside ... As for the remaining character, nothing is done with her either. She just visited a horrible place, and suddenly the film does not talk about her anymore, but geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls with bread, drinking homemade vodka and shooting themselves. Some may say that the film shows that society collapses, like the IFFR judges, but for me, it's a bad taste, a bad camera work, a bad scenario and a terribly bad direction . Therefore, I can not be as generous as my predecessor in ranking: 1!
