Once again, I tried my luck and rented this bag of shit. Regarded as a horror movie, there was not a scene, not one, which was even scary at a distance. NOT ONE!! Of course, there was nudity, but all the lesbian action became a bit old. I guess it was supposed to be the grace of this movie? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag !! From the beginning, I knew I was in the know when old Dan spoke for the first time. And he was supposed to be intimidating? What a laugh !! Overall, this movie is terribly awful! How on earth are films like this one made? If you want a movie with some thrills, do not rent this one. This film is as exciting as the Teletubbies.
