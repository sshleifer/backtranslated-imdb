Humm, an Italian film performed by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest, and in fact, I took less than I expected. That's not to say that this movie is the worst I've seen because I've seen worse things than that, but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting and some good gory scenes are the only thing that save that. Apart from that, you will love some special effects, they are really tacky and bad. Now, I only want to watch this director's "Troll 3", of course, it's not going to be worse than that.
