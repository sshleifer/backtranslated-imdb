Brides are dying at the altar and their bodies are disappearing. Nobody knows why or who, but an investigative journalist (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she will question her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with brides liquid to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short running time to not be boring. Unfortunately, even if the debut is good enough, he begins to hang out before halfway and becomes rather boring with his shots and his predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it- Bela Lugosi is charmingly bad and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, distant and very frightening Countess; and I'm still a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> This maintains a slightly Gothic atmosphere and the decors are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, it has failed to maintain my interest throughout the entire situation, and for that I have to misjudge it.
