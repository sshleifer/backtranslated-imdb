This movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and all the shit of the "little man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is just a useless horrible piece that should never have been presented to the theaters. The jokes are not funny and the acting is awful. Please, I beg you to save your money only to see this worthless crap. I had to endure sitting for an hour and a half near Little Man wishing that my eyes bleed. I'm disgusted to think of something like this! Who writes this shit? The actors have NO talent whatsoever, how do these people enter Hollywood? They make money with this junk!
