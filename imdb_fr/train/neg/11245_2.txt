I entered the Sky Captain Theater in 2004 while waiting for a good movie. Almost every criticism of this film was positive, the effects were seductive, the glimpses convincing. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the disappointment does not really describe the feeling felt by this movie. It was rage. <br /> <br /> In addition to being boring and poorly written, this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars because everything in the movie was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between homage and robbery: it was stealing. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not fly to advance one point or to advance the plot. They flew just to show they could. It is literally useless to show an excerpt of the Wizard of Oz in a movie theater at the beginning of the film, except to stage another scene (on which I will not say more) that steals the same movie. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even old-fashioned: it was literally a rewrite of something I had already seen, from robots of the pulpwood era reminiscent of old Superman Cartoons and the recent film "The Iron Giant", to the naughty silent martial artist who has been used in countless films, the most recognizable in recent years as the Dark Maul in "Star Wars: The ghost threat ". <br /> <br /> subject of the film, most of the performances were entirely in wood. This may be because the entire film was shot on a blue screen, with computerized images filling everything but the actors. Frankly, it's not an excuse for bad acting. If a person has ever been a child, she will understand that lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film contains no humanity. The protagonists are the only real human beings here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the movie can be counted on one hand. If robots attack the entire planet, should not we expect to see masses of humanity escape? The poor performances of the main characters prevent us from connecting to anything here. <br /> <br /> The film is not the worst film that exists, so I did not give it a 1 The film was rather an example of all that was wrong with the movies. Modern action: Filmmakers have tried to justify the film with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality, it does not fall flat.
