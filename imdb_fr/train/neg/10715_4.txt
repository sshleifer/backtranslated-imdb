What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses it. In fact, it never really happened. There was a bit of enthusiasm when we discovered that Angie was not really pregnant, and then we discovered that she was after all, but that was all. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was awful and his whole character was not even close to being important to this movie, aside from the extended one. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try for a pure comedy, which was unfortunately not the case, but maybe a drama with elements comic. I think that if the film had done that, it could have been very funny since the two actresses are quite funny in their own way. Sitting here, I can think of many scenarios that would have been a riot.
