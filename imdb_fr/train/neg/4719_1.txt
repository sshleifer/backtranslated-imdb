I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, breaks the necessary impartiality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people they interviewed, so you can not know if they are worth hearing. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from one point of view. Doing this is very dangerous because the next generations have learned the wrong idea, and that is why wars continue to come. I know this is not the only reason for the wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> you can watch this documentary, but read a lot on the Internet before. The balcans are as complex as human history.
