Easily the best known of all Shakespeare's plays, she was seriously abandoned here. Poor management, stagnant workshops and erratic performances ruin a beautiful tragedy. <br /> <br /> In Verona, Capulets and Montagues have been fighting for centuries, but tragedy is imminent when Rom√©o (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliette (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. A bloodshed is brewing soon ... <br /> <br /> The studio work, especially in the daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. It's a story that, with its energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Coupled with this, the costumes are awful, with too much tights and ridiculous codes. The fight on stage seems horrible, with too much stretching and running to be interesting. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a true Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the plot begins, but his majestic accent and his bland, often expressionless eyes limit his reach. It is very difficult for the public to understand this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she captures the naivety of the character, but a little more madness would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> The secondary roles are not more interesting. Joseph O'Connor's brother Laurence is doing well, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs to the scene and not to the camera. He grunts and gesticulates excessively and therefore looks rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman, downplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. It has developed an advantage and an intensity allowing it to offer great performances on the screen in recent years, but this is not obvious here. The prince may be a good role with his brief appearances but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the piece any authority in front of the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, probably in his best role in this series, comes out with dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story instead.
