Let's start with the beginning . In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> the music is completely pale and ineffective. Moreover, AJAY DEVGAN, WHO WITHDRAWN A LETTER 'A' from his spelling, did a good job but did not use a bad movie like this one. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll who is used to entertain the audience, although she is good to watch but her role in the movie is to dance. In fact, she is a member of a rock band and I do not think any rock band has a dancer in her band. <br /> <br /> In shell nuts this movie is a piece of shit a piece of *** t. look at him if you want to be fooled.
