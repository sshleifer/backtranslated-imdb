It's just a bad movie. With what appeared to be a pretty good budget, the potential was much better. It was almost. With a beautiful heroine almost similar to Salma Hayek, a hero who fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost as in Crouching Tiger ..., a music almost similar to that of, for example, Conan ... etc . But in the end, it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting. Perhaps apart from John Rhys-Davies dueling like those warriors from Hero or Crouching Tiger, mentioned earlier ... I'm really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all a good actor and deserves a lot better. So, like you, so if you still have a chance, watch something else.
