I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was young enough, so part of the movie is blurry to try to remember. However, I can say that it was not as funny as a movie called "tomato killers" should have been and the most memorable things in this movie are the song and the scene where the elderly couple are talking poor Timmy. Apart from this, the film only includes scenes of small tomatoes and large tomatoes that roll and where people act frightened and overflowing as it should be in a movie of this type. However, the mere fact of having a very ridiculous place and a catchy song is not a good comedy. True, this movie is supposed to be a B-movie, nothing to take seriously, however, you still have to make funny jokes and not try to extend a slightly fun principle into a full-fledged movie. Perhaps a short film would have been acceptable, as the caravan showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperate to shoot a bigger tomato were actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a simulated trailer, but no, they did indeed make a complete and rather weak movie.
