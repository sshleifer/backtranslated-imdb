Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship between a shy and lonely videographer and a struggling artist who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an online dating site. Which in itself is not so unusual, but it is their method of communication. Abandoning the verbal, they take notes and communicate later by video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the relationship of the creator (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), who, besides writing and directing, plays the role of the main characters too. With elements of vanguard, anti-intrigue and docudrama, the film disperses to the wind with an undecided structure nestled between narcissism and indulgence of oneself. <br /> As the film wears out, a brief separation and deterioration of their once fascinating form of communication ages as the couple faces the difficulties of reality. Focusing solely on inner conflicts or the woes of the relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor poignant. It could have been easily circumvented with the addition of a secondary plot and an external conflict, and a third act, which did not exist, namely a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere. <br /> What is even more aggravating is the descent of the film of the story in the reality which ends abruptly by an open and unsatisfactory finish. It would have been perfect, but there is no question asked and no sense to discover or meditate. <br /> <br /> (Note that the film contains a beautiful animation and a lively and touching soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of the production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, look the movie and decide.
