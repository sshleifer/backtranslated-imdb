"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to play in a film like this; <br /> <br /> This is one of those films, I suppose, that is considered "art", but that is not duped ..... it's garbage. Stick to the "art" that you can admire in a frame because movies labeled as such are usually unintelligible fakes. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud recites "The Tempest" while the camera away for naked people. One of them is a small child who is urinating in a pool. Wow, it's a gray thing and a real "art", is not it ?? This is just an example. Most of the story has no meaning, is impossible to follow and, therefore, liberal critics are afraid to say they have not "understood", so they give it the highest rating to save their false ego. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
