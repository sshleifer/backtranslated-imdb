... or maybe it's so bad. The plot is a first, which is strange because it is supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. The film as a whole seems almost an inexpensive remake of the first film, with scenes imitating the events of the first, but much more ridiculous and improbable. Where the first has had an excellent cast, this one is made up of actors and rejects of the list B. The acting is horribly bad. Half of the good lines of the film are taken directly from the first, like almost all the main characters, including those who were not in the first film. I realize this was created by a TV show pilot episode, but that's not an excuse. They did not have to turn the (bad) images into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and these are the erotic sequences. However, as they are not nearly as good as those in the first match, even that does not increase the score above 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be you want something erotic that is not porn, it's worth checking out. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. 1/10
