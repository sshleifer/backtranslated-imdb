I did not expect much from this movie, but oh my brother, what a stink. <br /> <br /> I found this jewel in a giant $ 5 DVD box at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this record was, I feel ripped. The special effects resembled those in high school, the work of the camera was marred by unstable tripods and sketchy lighting, and the acting was a perfect example of the "Christian school". One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" organized by the production society after the return of the wrath - the people who financed this thing must have serious anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production society that launched it. Think of their anguish when they saw their investment rise to $ 914.86 US. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe the filmmakers of Xian need to watch GOOD movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good . Credible stories and characters, fanaticism and less hysterical arms, oh, and a story that appeals to everyone, not just true believers. That is to say. Stop the sermon, save it for the church. Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example. Excellent films with fascinating scenarios, excellent cinematography and intense music. No hysterical arms. No preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie had had a laugh, it would have been MUCH better.
