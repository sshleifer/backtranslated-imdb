I saw Mom ... well, she did not really kiss Santa Claus; he has his hand on his thigh and bad thoughts in his head. <br /> <br /> It was enough to emotionally mark a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to become a bitter man who was upset by the quality of the toys made and the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> Expecting a real horror movie, I was very disappointed that fewer than a handful of people died, and there was no nudity. What a desappointment. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie, but it was too slow and did not really have a good screenplay. I did not expect a great acting, but I really wanted action. There were none.
