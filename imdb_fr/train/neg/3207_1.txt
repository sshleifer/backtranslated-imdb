Oh my God it was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This film is taken far too seriously ... unless of course they were funny. I saw it last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and everyone was laughing at every scene. I think my favorite was "should not you study medicine in Oopsalof"! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could pile up in the single phrase of Nicalo's character "we'll be together ... it's our destiny". I'm sorry, but after the first time, the words have lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this lesson to Americans: you can not animate, so please do not try. You are just embarrassing yourself.
