This is the worst movie I have ever paid to see and except for "They saved Hitler's brain," the worst film I've ever seen. When this film was released, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and was therefore anticipating what I thought was the funniest film that could be produced because it did not include the restrictions on television improvisational programming. <br /> <br /> The writers must have thought we were going to be rude, flatulence jokes, inexpensive sex and we have a risky side that divides the comedy laughable. Game show skits are nothing more than unimaginable and cheap take-offs on Let's Make a Deal with gross stupidity. The sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just bad humor in high school. The stun gun advertisement was a proper humor for Seasame Street. The Los Angeles metro sketch was a bland humor using an odor of tasteless blood. The French chef walking blindly saying "there is no difference" with a French accent, it was good, you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The only funny skit is about Chevy Chase and lasts a minute. That means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I read the comments about the whole country that was stoned in the 1970s and you will like this film if you are high placed. Most of the country was not stoned in the 1970s. If inept writers were stoned, it should have been a sleepy sinus medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater besides me when I saw this movie. Of course, nothing says yet how bad the movie was.
