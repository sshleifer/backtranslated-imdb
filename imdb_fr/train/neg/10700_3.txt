The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - MP - played by Colin Clive) and his connection to Katherine Hepburn's character Amelia Earhart. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met Hepburn, strange but fascinating, he "could not help it" and they fell in love. You can tell because they look a lot in space and talk endlessly of the pain of their unrequited love. Frankly, it's a terribly dated movie that's almost impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that at the time of the pre-code, movies about fascinating adultery were very common. Moreover, even if you accept this morally suspect subject, the absolute solitude of the dialogue makes it sound like a nineteenth-century love novel ... and a very bad novel. Sticky and with characters hard to love (after all, Clive's wife is a nice lady and has done no harm to anyone), which is a big waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume that Hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume! You must see it to believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (an obscure but appropriate reference).
