I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, dull and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, to say the least. This film was just a useless movie in the Tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of the formation of graboids, this story is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story, go back to the time you use the SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross), to be someone from the past, when he's someone present in the other Tremor movies.Geez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time.Stick Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, to have a good time.This film ensures that you are at a distance sitting next to you with the button STOP working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.
