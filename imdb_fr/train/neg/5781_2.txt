Roman Polanski has made many films that are not exceptional. His fame baffles me. Nothing stands out as a highlight other than Chinatown (I have never seen "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Every contribution he made to the film ended more than twenty years ago; his work is simply embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's baby must have meant the end of the establishment by the time he arrived outside. It's a luxury concept and high enough for a 'horror' movie from 1968 (never show the baby). But this is just a badly conceived horror sap. Everything is artistic to the point that the plot becomes desperately clear very early (Um, thank you for this final destructive title), and on a clear day you can see the twist end for days. It did not support my interest. I find that whatever this film may have been, it is completely derailed by the 1960s version of what femininity was. Farrow is a housewife / housewife so distracted and helpless. Her fragility is oversold ... she is irritating to the extreme. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> Dakota is hardly exploited for its disturbing potential.
