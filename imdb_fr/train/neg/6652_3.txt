It was a strange kind of movie about a low life in New York and centered on a main character (the name of the title, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a musician like Ricky Nelson, except that he does not have real talent. . <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch until a New York-style woman, with a horrible and tough accent, steps in and takes over. It ruined the film for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough, scruffy women. <br /> <br /> The hairstyle on Pitt - an exaggerated pompadour - was fun to watch. I can imagine that Johnny Depp plays this role better. One last note: it is strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen's) with a mono sound.
