After watching KHAKEE, I feel like I can watch another good movie, but unfortunately, the movie is a joke and actually tries to introduce Aryeman Afterall, his father, Keshu, the producer. <br /> <br /> RKS talked so much about the film during the promotions, saying that the film had a different meat than the movies released at the time, I wonder what films he was talking about. <br /> <br /> The film is in fact a typical Masala film, with lots of comedy, romance and action while scrambling <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap family is one of the most fun moments in history. Imagine children kidnapping Dawood's family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete hubbub with a sudden change in characterization <br /> RKS gives his weakest movie to date, except some scenes from Bachchan the film is boring <br /> <br /> The music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh trying to give the role to everyone does its part well, although not its best that he twists his face too much by pulling a trigger and makes a weird look while smoking the cigar H the dubbing itself is not doubled <br /> <br /> Akshay stays there for a few minutes and repeats his gesture and his hams <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems inexpressive, tries too hard but covers up too few scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika emerges the best of the lot <br /> <br /> The rest okay
