I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in Wal-Mart's $ 1.00 box. When I saw it was "Stephen Foster's story", as a musician and music educator, I had to see him. I had no idea what year it was made because it was not on the cover, but simply that it was a remake of "Sewanee River" of 1939. The portrait of the composer by Bill Shirley is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man does NOT have testosterone and is a waitress all the way! I can not believe Stephen Foster thought that music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying for it! In addition to this ridiculous idea, Ray Middleton and his black-faced "Christy Minstrels" play Stephen Foster's hard-to-read songs, to say the least. I can hardly believe anyone would consider this film appropriate for resuscitation in our time. It is an embarrassment and should be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten ... moreover, Eileen Christy's portrait of Jeanie was certainly the culmination of this lowest point in Hollywood history.
