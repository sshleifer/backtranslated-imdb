This film did not provide anything new or worthwhile. After seeing it, my wife and I agreed that the studio had just unveiled that and could have been less concerned about whether it was entertaining. This is a good example of a "purely conceptual" movie - they have a concept about a movie and the other details do not matter because the directors know that it will make money right on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Cruella coming out of prison and on parole. She no longer hates puppies but was programmed to love them - she just could not hurt a flea. It does not last long after her release and she has returned to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most boring aspects of the film were the secondary characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me hate him - and it's hard because I'm a fan of Python. It was obvious that he did this because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Tim McInnerny, Cruella's low-self-esteem servant, was funny in Black Adder's television series, but he's totally lost and nothing. And Gerard Depardieu had to cost a few dollars, but he was also completely lost. There were also other secondary actors but, given the poor writing of the characters, I try to stop them. <br /> <br /> All in all, you'd better let your children watch TV than the trouble of letting them see this drivel.
