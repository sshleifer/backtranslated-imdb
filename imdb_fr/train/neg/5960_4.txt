My friends and I rented this album for "Bad Movie Night" with a lot of hope, but The Brain was a little disappointing. The brain itself has a superb clumsy appearance, but it rests mainly on its small platform. Who thought it would be nice for the brain to hold only three people in 94 minutes? At first, this film has many objectives, including a main role of Estevez playing the role of a rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intelligence is misguided in his elaborate pranks and his school cascades, like putting glue krazy on someone's chair). He also has some great lines, a hilarious, breathless and breathless henchman, who barely manages to be everywhere and, yeah, a chick gets undressed. However, the director desperately needs to be educated in the art of stimulation. In the last half, things are just beginning, with at least three or four useless and boring pursuit scenes that make up the central third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running in the same stairwell. I could have set the scenario for this thing in half an hour: more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more brain action. If you want to make a bad horror movie, give me at least something cool to watch while my superego stops. Maybe the director was really trying to get the audience into his movie - I started to feel like one of the zombified townspeople at the end of the crapfest.
