I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor or it's just a very bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew it would not be a good movie, I just did not think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days when you could find fun and funny lines in any movie? When actors did not have to play ridiculous roles to try to be funny? We are now with movies like this one, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find the most fun pieces! <br /> <br /> Just jump this trash <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my english)
