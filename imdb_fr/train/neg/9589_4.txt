This movie is horrible if you pay attention. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful pictures dancing on the screen - each with no apparent connection to the other. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I really enjoy musicals. In the end, Bowie was in the movie for ten minutes total. The songs and dance sequences were rare and unsatisfactory. The moral of the story was really confused. I could not say if it was racial issues in London in the 1950s or not to sell. During the first half of the movie, I laughed how old it was, but I liked the campaign style of the "no way to sell" message. When the blacks started to be murdered, I thought my gang had been ruined. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? No, there was a song and a dance sequence "Keep Britain White". I'm sorry, but World War II is not a subject on which you can write a musical. At least not a musical that could be described as "campy" as I repeated several times in this review. Overall, I would say that this film could do a lot better if it decided and directed better actors. (And put David Bowie longer!) My note: C-
