It is interesting to note that a novel without plot has become the basis of two films. Although The Heiress is a good adaptation, if not quite accurate, Washington Square is a heavy actor and badly played, with the exception of the role of Dr. Sloper, a movie that could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I collapsed. He does not have the sober and simple beauty that a film without intrigue, like Onegin. I agree with other comments on Leigh's portrayal of Catherine as being silly instead of being naive and timid; she made me disdain that she does not feel feelings for her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childlike trust to adult cynicism, to the whole sense of history, was internalized, as in the novel. But we do not have the advantage of a narrative voice to tell us in a movie! I think someone skipped an adaptation course at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's efforts to make a moving and beautiful film from a difficult text, but it just did not work.
