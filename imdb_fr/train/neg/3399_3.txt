Birthday Girl does not know what he wants to be - is it a comedy, is it a drama ... it just does not know it. What could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in a no man's land. The premise is original enough to have guaranteed a scenario full of interesting scenarios, but presents almost none and eventually deteriorates. It's a shame if you watch the cast - it's very solid all the way through, but they do not have the chance to shine. Very disappointing.
