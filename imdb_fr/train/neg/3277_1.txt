If you've ever watched Dukes of Hazard, you know you never have to worry about drugs, rude words, or rude behavior from young kids. If you've seen the movie, you know it's not the case anymore! This movie was horrible! The main characters taking drugs and thinking it's funny and cool are certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and simply turned it into a trash bin. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original series, now seems to act as if she belonged around the corner and was paid for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it was released. Fifteen minutes after the beginning of the film, I was ready to leave. I stayed thinking that it had to get better but instead, it got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie. This destroyed a good show and left only horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, because it's not just a waste of money, but a waste of 2 hours of your life that you will never find!
