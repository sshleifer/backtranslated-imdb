This ridiculous film offers the standard "hippie mentality" of the 1970s and annoys us at the same time. It's an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of innocent young women with sex demons and older sex washes A naive young hippie played by the Kayif-like (Kay Lenz) who walks and sleeps with all the bad guys, then encounters one day ridicule (Holden), already old, drinking strong alcohol and pretending to be the actor and she decides that she is "in love" with him. If you think this is superficial, the entire movie encapsulates such scenes. She does not stop saying how much she "loves" her and she only met him, he is slim and very fast. I could not help laughing all through the movie. It is obvious that she only uses it as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that we are going to buy that there is in fact love. A disgusting scene is one where both are naked and have sex, I had to move quickly because it almost inspired me to throw up. A cheesy 70s music offer is also shown in the film. Avoid that if you can. Grade D.
