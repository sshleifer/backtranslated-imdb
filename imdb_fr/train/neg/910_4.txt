The plot was very simple and easy to follow and contained many comedies to such an extent that they became boring. Some viewers seemed to find that funny, but I like smarter humor. <br /> <br /> There were several Swedish actors known in the film and their performance was decent given the scenario. Lena Endre was beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie. I can not say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan This film may be worth considering.
