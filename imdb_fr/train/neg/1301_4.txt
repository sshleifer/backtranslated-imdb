I recently saw this at Palm Springs International Film 2009. This is the first feature film by Dutch actress Monique van de Ven. I hate movies so improbable that you choose practically every scene. This film immediately lets you scratch your head. At first, a young photographer and his girlfriend, who works for an international humanitarian organization, are quietly walking through the Taliban-controlled mountains in Afghanistan, talking about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get off their vehicles to watch the Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute the five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who drops a grenade that kills his girlfriend. as they are at a distance from throwing by hand, they can not be more than 50 meters away and yet it escapes. Her girlfriend is exploded and he takes a picture of the moment of the impact of the grenade that kills her and wins a Photographer of the Year award for the photo. All the scenes and situations of this film are as ridiculous as its opening. The following year, Bob went on a mission to National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and settled in his dark world of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
