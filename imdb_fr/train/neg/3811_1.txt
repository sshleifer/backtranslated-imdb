I hated this shit every Friday as part of tgif, and I constantly drank a lot with stupidity every week. If you want to see something fun, check out "No On Would Tell" with Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever pursues a good film career after a dreaded TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these kids, and Bob Saget needs to go jump off a bridge to do this crapfest. I've seen fun things everywhere else but here. I wrote 10 lines! Watch "packed house" to see what humanity has to offer in terms of art and entertainment.
