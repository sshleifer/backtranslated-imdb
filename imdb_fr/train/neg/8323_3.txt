From the beginning, this movie had some flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a young and rich nabob who has inherited the considerable wealth and power of his father. He struggles to fill his father's shoes and cut the cords of the apron. He also has the problem of having a heart problem and waiting in the limbo of the organ donor registry. There are also minor back stories that your first instinct must ignore for the most part and become important afterwards, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his love affair with a middle-class girl. (Jessica Alba) Uncreative stories, but not enough to ruin the movie. The only true "oy vey!" moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. Dominant woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated the fact that people who find the scary surgery scenes might not do it. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was well done at first. Christensen screams internally through the thoracic incision and the rib spreader. The ironic moment of the trailers then comes when, while he is one of the few unfortunate to be awake during anesthesia, he is also lucky as it helps him understand that his surgical team is considering 'murder. <br /> <br /> The big turn, however, is very predictable and sends the film plunge into the conspiracy and its memories of the little signs that were there but it, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> There are two other twists in the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture from Olin, who seems unimpressive because of poor writing. The other is a secret from the family's past that seemed very sharp and useless. <br /> <br /> The initially successful drama of anesthesia awareness is lost in the drama of the badly written plot. There is one last attempt to bring him back that falls flat, causing the whole film.
