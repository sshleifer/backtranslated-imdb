Always enjoy great movies that deal with super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film has just cut me off from production and production. There is nothing that can enter into a deep discussion of what this story must tell; All I can say is a waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an outstanding performance in his homeland, England, and we saw it in "Still Standing", a television series. Heath Ledger, played the real bad guy and we recently saw him in "Brokeback Mountain", 05, played a leading role. Shannyn Sossaman (Mara Sinclair) was successful in seducing a priest from a church that would not be recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
