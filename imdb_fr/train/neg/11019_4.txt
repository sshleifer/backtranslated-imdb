Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even for filmmakers B, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his best films. Yes, it destroys Poe's great story "Premature Burial" and, yes, it's badly paced and uneven, but it's also very entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, frail housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is about to remove her because he needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry ). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core films from the early '90s, is actually offering the film's best performance as a slutty mistress. You'll also enjoy the small roles played by Karen Black as a medium, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
