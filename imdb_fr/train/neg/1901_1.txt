This review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 "Car Hunt" movie, gone in 60 seconds, is starting well. In fact, it's well played and the plot moves pretty well. But even a big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who did not know it, the original plot had thieves as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change in almost every aspect of HB The original Halicki remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final scene of the chase, the part of version 74 that made it great . The one in this version is diluted, only 10 minutes, and leads to a special monster effect that removes any credibility to the hunt. Where the initial pursuit was very credible, the star was a stuntman who made his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase movie, put the original in the bargain basket of your local rental agency and stay away from the new remake.
