It reminded me SOO of Michael Winner's "Dirty Weekend", with its low-budget English vibe. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I am a fan of exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, for example, "insane" for his ineptness and "last house left" for his brutality without shame. And so many inventive Italian fallout and more and more brutal. <br /> <br /> It was just useless. A bit like a UK budget manager thought 'remodel' I spit on your grave 'without making it too painful now that the horror is back in fashion with Hostel. <br /> <br /> The whole thing does not hold together. or have a point. What is the girl of the rapists? Why bother to make the man an expert in security cameras? Crappy.
