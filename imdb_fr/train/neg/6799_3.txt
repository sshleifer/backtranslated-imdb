do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, this film looks like a movie in which Doris Day starred, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was an air hostess and stewardess, then landed the aircraft after her disturbed husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot and killed the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing, than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and managed to put it down without much help from the control tower. I know a little 747 planes, I was myself a flight attendant. As I said, do not expect much from this film, it was done for a cheap budget. Producers were cheap to use a plane bearing the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that several movies have used. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
