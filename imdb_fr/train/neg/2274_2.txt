Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love movies, so I have to watch those crisp films in the movies. And I was hoping that Vanilla Sky would be fine. I hoped that they would keep the original "Open your eyes" in exactly the same way, or that they would appropriate it. Well, it's a bit of both and it sucks. <br /> <br /> It's all started well. I like Radiohead. I wish there was more of that. But in the end, we listen to Good Vibrations from The Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of sucking in between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe two or three others, but why oh why did they have to silence GV during the heyday. It was more annoying than confusing or flagrant. Especially when he has nothing to do with the plot. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = primary. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> He also did an amazing job with the clubs scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the movie was a big ball of arrogance. As if the audience was going to have the movie. Those who would get it would read subtitles, and others would not. It's that simple. Motivations have messed up everything. I did not understand Diaz's motives (did not they make chicken soup the night before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay at sea. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in these types of movies [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I understood. Anyway, they tried to enhance the original with a shabby American rock soundtrack, mediocre angles, a good movie feel and glossy processing. It would have been helpful if Crowe had not ruined everything. <br /> 2/10 Major disappointment.
