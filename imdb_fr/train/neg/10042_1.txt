This long awaited film ... But it disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the film the first day ... According to the trailers, it looked like an action movie, but it turned out that this would be a comedy in its own right (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves to be appreciated is the acting of these professional actors, they played very well their role in the film. Well done, but I do not think it can save the movie. India has been beautifully filmed. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) Were all saturated with color, okay. Nevertheless, the way in which the intrinsic beauty of these places was filmed made me want to know exactly where these places were and when I could go ;-) <br /> <br /> The action sequences have Was shot very badly, no one could do it. They used Akki (Akshay Kumar) very well but could have done a lot better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I've ever seen in recent movies (The movies of the 90s had better animated scenes (the initial scene where the car is falling, "flying should be a better word" on the lake road). <br /> <br /> And the name of the movie was mentioned almost every 20 to 30 mins, just to be sure the public does not forget the name of the movie, I guess ..
