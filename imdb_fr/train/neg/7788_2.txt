I noticed just how much of this film's critics mention how "healthy" and "entertaining" it is. These people have to leave the house more often. I do not know why they are looking for this piece of tasteless, tasteless and brainless fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and her ineptitude is surpassed only by that of her co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to ban the insidious practice of inflicting deficiencies without talent. to an unsuspecting public who pass habit which unfortunately persists to this day). A good cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) is trying to make sense of it, but to no avail. I noticed that two administrators shared the same credit, although "credit" is not the word I would use (just like "director"). In terms of "healthy entertainment", many types of movies are available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit there. Find one of these movies and skip this one.
