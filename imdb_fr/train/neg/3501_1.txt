I understand the jokes very well, they are just not good. The show is horrible. I understand it and that's another horrible thing about it. The only nice character that ever appeared in the show was this hobo in this episode, but then I see the other episode, including this episode, and the series is horrible. It's not funny, not funny! I do not want people to say, "Only intelligent people understand," because if they are as smart, why do they judge people they do not even know and say they are not smart or intellectual enough? to understand it? It's like saying "The sky is red" but never look outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst series I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, his controversy is very lame, his jokes are pet and other body jokes Fluids are really stupid and usually consist of very bad actions. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they know nothing about one of us is not really a smart comment.
