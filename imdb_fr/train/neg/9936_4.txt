I took it for 50 cents at the flea market and I was pretty excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Mick and the gang at their peak, I wish there was not too much dubbing dialogue to hear what they say and play. <br /> <br /> The sketches are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, sort of Monty Python poorly written on acid. I spent more time looking at England's retreat in the late 1960s than what was actually happening in ridiculous sketches. <br /> <br /> This film reminds us that times really change and that what was important soon becomes obvious. idiot. Good song, but it has now been played to death by this DVD.
