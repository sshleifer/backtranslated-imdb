Born Again is a sub-standard episode of season 1. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and does not fly. I have never been great in reincarnation and this could be part of my apathy towards this episode. It refers to the Tooms case, which is an interesting continuation of the previous episode. But the good things end there. This is unfortunate because it happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead guy chooses to reincarnate in the body of a completely independent girl. And he's waiting for the girl to be eight to start taking revenge. There is even a serious lack of spiritual dialogue between Mulder and Scully to keep the episode afloat. If you are in reincarnation, maybe this episode is for you. If you are not, you can at least learn what bradycardia is.
