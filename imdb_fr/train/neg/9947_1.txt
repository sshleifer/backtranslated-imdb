This movie was horrible. I swear they did not even write a script, they just went through the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying. * SPOILERS Phht plus as reasons not to look at it * They sit down and have breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have left for a long time. The terrain was difficult, it was almost impossible to track him without dogs. And when ICE-T is on this hill and uses this Spaz-15 Assault assault rifle as a sniper rifle (then felling a tree with eight shells?), It would take thousands of shells to shoot down a tree that size.) and handguns are considered inaccurate to 100 meters. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light ?? I did not see a litter on this thing. Moreover, when he was shot in the stomach and continued, it was delayed, he would have bled to death there. Plus the end where he stuffs a stone or a cigarette into the barrel of guys. He could not explode and kill him. The ball would still shoot at Ice T but tarnish the gun.
