This hamlet was one of the most boring episodes of MST3000. I'm not a fan of Shakespear, but I do not think he ever wanted his work to be so slow and rhythmic. It's also one of the most difficult movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed. As I said, this one is rather boring. It is in black and white, the pace is slow and the landscapes are minimal. The actors are all doubled too, so it does not help. This is the one, the MST 3000 that I can not watch in one sitting, because the player who plays Hamlet says that his aftershocks can put anyone to sleep.
