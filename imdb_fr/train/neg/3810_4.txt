When I was younger, I loved this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is dark, poorly written and rarely funny. The three main actors were all good actors and funny men (Saget's stand up was much better than what the show produced, just as Coulier was a better stand up and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to leave the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was finally canceled when many actors asked for more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some elements that make me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Slogans - How many times can a person endure such tiring slogans as "how rude", "Did you get him guy," "nerdbomber", "cut him off" and "have mercy" in a 24 hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - The most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. The writing is obsolete and cliché like an Oreo cookie. There is good cliché writing and bad cliché writing. Full House had a cliche writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco, that's enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic stuff - Too many things to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy Kids - The girls had all the latest trends in malls and you can see trendy signage posters in which they would be. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved, because I think that many of them have talent. But this show was so sweet that I could not stand it anymore.
