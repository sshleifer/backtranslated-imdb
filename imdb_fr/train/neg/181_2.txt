Ah, Channel 5 of the local Mexican TV channel! Every day at 2 o'clock in the morning, they broadcast horror movies from the 70s to the early 2000s. It was the movie "Return to the cottage on the lake" released yesterday. I regret watching her. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a bass parakeet regularly appreciated and was well accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes resembles a soap-opera because of its absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that should not be watched by anyone. Not even for mediocre movie lovers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
