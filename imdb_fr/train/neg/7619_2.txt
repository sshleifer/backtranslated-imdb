As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can resist ANY film that can be imposed on it, but there is absolutely no reason to do it. <br /> <br /> Ranked "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section The Dreaded "Restricted Viewing Sticker" I guess these are the only methods that the filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 , 50% of an unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Robert Napton! You should be ashamed to exploit these poor Mexican actors to whom you have probably promised the hope of succeeding in American cinema. You are a shame! <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this film that reserves the least action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And is not it an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always day? Why did it take half of the movie to show anything ... and more importantly, why did we look at the other half? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
