I tried to watch this abomination of cinema when I was five years old; I have never been the same since. Filled with drug-induced images that feel the delusions of your average asylum seeker, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not intended for humans, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins the drum of his classmate waiting for him by passing the head; yes, putting her head through it. But do not worry, my friends! He is quickly consoled by his chirping flute, which is quite strange, I will grant you, but will remain acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The film turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are. but loses all the "warm and fuzzy" aspects of one or the other of these books. <br /> <br /> Barney's 7-foot-yellow parent befriends the poor boy and plunges him further into despair. <And, to add the pleasing range of horrible themes, a carnivorous ship, once a friend of the motley crew of grandfather clocks and doped "dragons", is added to the mix of chaos. </ b> <br /> The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, rightly nicknamed "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: with an obvious plastic mask forcing her facial expressions to face a broom whose gas level always seemed to be low at the most inopportune moments. As a result of this, one of his favorite pastimes was to plunge his nose into the water that separates the country of Pufnstuf from his degenerate and decaying home (I do not know where I would have preferred to live). <Br/> <br /> In short, this film is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects on its audience as The Exorcist, this one is made for you. Enjoy.
