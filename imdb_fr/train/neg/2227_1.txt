From time to time, someone out of the blue stares at me and asks, "What's going on with SNITCH'D?" I know immediately that they have a case of fun barely hidden + horror. You see, I was the director of photography on the film. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, one day after shooting TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm film that, like so many other independent films of that time, was never distributed despite the honors of the festival. he fell forever forever under the features of SAG's notorious experimental film contract. But I'm moving away from the subject ... <br /> <br /> I thought I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster movie in 16mm with a filming budget of about $ 25,000, not wanting to pick up speed, took it. After all, GREFFIERS, EL MARIACHI ... I too believed in myth at the time. <br /> <br /> Let's describe it as a "film school" for many people involved, including myself. SNITCH'D was shot and wounded for two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught drama in a high school in that city (yes, he is a professor of drama and English ... consider THAT while watching the movie, or even observing the use of the apostrophe in the title), from where the places and the distribution. <BR/> <br /> It's worth noting that in her casting, Vera Jimenez, the Channel 2 Morning News weather star in Los Angeles, and her first appearance of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood eager to get a movie to his credit. I must say that his professional dedication, focus and "do it" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadowing of his upcoming celebrity. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optical problems, low light or electricity, several ramp operators of the day and the delivery of an uncorrected offline file for the purpose of duplication. None of this surpasses the actual content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in 2003, the film was sold to distributors (net loss, I understand), which, inexplicably, did not have a picture of Eva on the box (she was then called more and more) but who managed to get a clear picture of what appears to be an authentic Latin gangster to give SNITCH'D credibility. As Cahill's other passion is the sale of antiques, this seems to confirm that he is convinced that you can judge a book by its cover ... as many have already bought for this DVD. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now on a soap opera, and I met James for a day to shoot a short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen a play despite the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another film on Cahill entitled JUAREZ, Mexico. I thought he had worked out the process; my participation depended on the cast, the script and the control of the team, and the resulting film seemed promising in the dailies, for what it was ... an inexpensive police story surrounding the mass murder of girls in Juarez ; Despite claims made here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER been shown in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly stated that the film was distributed and was just waiting for its release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio images on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and VILLE FRONTIÃˆRE.
