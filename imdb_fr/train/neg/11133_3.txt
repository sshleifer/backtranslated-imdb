Except for acting talents better than the average of the two main actors, this movie is really, really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you would not really notice that production values ​​are cheap if they did not keep trying to convince you that they had a production value to start with. Even for a maniac like B-movie like me, this movie is really bad.
