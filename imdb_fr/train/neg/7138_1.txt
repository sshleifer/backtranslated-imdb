To play is horrible. This film makes Fast and Furious look like an award-winning film by an academy. They throw some breasts and butts inside to try to keep you interested despite the extremely weak and wacky story. There is a reason why people do not even download this movie. This film sank like an iron dung. Do not waste your time renting or even downloading it. This film is and will always be a PERMA-TURD film. I am now more stupid to have looked at it. In fact, this title should now be called "PERMA-TURD". To call it a film is a travesty and an insult. abominable, abominable, frightful, frightful, bestial, cruel, hateful, unpleasant, disgusting, frightful, disturbing, execrable, fairy, fearful, atrocious, atrocious, macabre, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, gloomy, lurid, wicked, obnoxious, offensive, repulsive, repulsive, disgusting, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sickie, terrible, terrifying, impious, ungodly, naughty
