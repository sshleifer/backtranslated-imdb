Nathan Detroit organizes illegal craps for big players in New York, but it's hot and he can not find a safe place. He is betting on the chronic Sky Masterson player that he can not do primal missionary, Sarah Brown, going out to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but the two men have some surprises in store ?? <br /> <br /> This is one of those dear MGM 50s musicals in vivid colors, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances for match; Broadway has photographed for the big screen if you like that kind of thing, which I do not like. My main problem with this type of movies is simply music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway concerts on the horizon are punctuated by an infinite pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flute at the end of every fourth measure. It's not my cup of tea. This was written by the team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on two stories by Damon Runyon), and although the plot is quite affable, the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers, for example, are identical, useless, do not advance the plot and do not scrape you (and are equally egregious if you mind). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as one might expect) and Sit Down, you're Rockin 'The Boat (well played by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get to them. The strength of the film is that a young Brando gives a thoughtful and relaxed performance. He also sings very well and even dances a little. It also goes with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which they both escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from Noo Yawk's noise, turmoil, and vowel murder. Fans of musicals can dig that, but in my opinion, a musical must do more than just film the show.
