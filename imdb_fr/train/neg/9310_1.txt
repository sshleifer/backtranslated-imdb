OK - I LOVE this movie ... I'll credit this movie - alone - for making me so fanatical about horror. I could never watch this movie alone. I also heard a lot of stories about the effect of its original release in theaters, on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece ... Horrific and psychological things frighten me. Blessed be their heart, whatever the director of this awesome film. I like that. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - it's the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what's going on in the film and the idea of ​​the film is not scary enough, but what has always attracted me is the fabulous actor Brendan. Best horror movie EVER. Nothing can ever be so scary. Halloween watching at its worst.
