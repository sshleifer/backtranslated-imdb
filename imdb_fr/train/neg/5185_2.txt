A total loss of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a total waste of time. The script and dialogues are poorly written, the staging is dull and the acting is close to hammy. This film was clearly aimed at the public of Rang De Basanti, but it is far from being up to par because it does not even have one of the elements RDB connects with its audience_great script, its great acting, its good direction and a powerful social message that has never been preached, but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this quasi-masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back by resorting to such scenes. as the hero takes a flight on the Persian carpet of the villain and his mentor watching the bullets in a truck no less! All of this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when the quality of the films was deteriorating and bad films like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante had become great successes, but filmmaking had become more subtle and thoughtful. time. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate the fact that he wants to give a social message to every film he makes, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He uses sermons without worrying about the intelligence of the audience to understand what he is trying to say. Perhaps he should simply focus on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with everything I say, you will agree throughout the projection. thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and that Mr. Santoshi should have left the torch to Om Shanti Om. Denigration of the industry? Santoshi described the industry as a place of quilting, cheating and casting in which the hero is pleased with a starlet curiously named Sania. Some people will think that these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In total, raise your voice against movies like this and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * out of ****.
