The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by her aunt cosmetic queen resembling Estee Lauder. His aunt (by marriage, we have to presume) tries to find his long lost family in Europe. They just have to photograph a girl standing near an ornate music box. The researcher travels to Europe and conducts research in places such as Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The landscape is real and was shot on location (unlike a murder, She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to visit a very remote area and where Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also trying to solve a family mystery and unites to search for clues and threaten the bad guys. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched it because of the scenery, but the script was so bad that I just stayed to see if it would get worse. It made. To act was also extinguished. I can see why Mel Harris's career never really took off after thirty years, but she is adequate (she seems too old for her co-star). But, the support players are straight out of the community theater. I also lost count of the number of times they said "Budapest". Yes, it's pronounced Bood-a-Phesht. We know, okay? I realized midway that it must be one of those Harlequin films and that's it. Guess who says everything.
