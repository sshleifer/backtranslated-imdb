I thought that the nadir of horror filmmaking had been hit with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This film looks like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless and unreduced fecal matter that has the audacity to be called a movie. I would write more, but I'm still too upset to have been silly enough to spend Â£ 3 on rentals, reels. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where the forest is> I lived in the UK two-thirds of my life and, as far as I know, there are no black forests and unexplored in the Midlands. It all looked like a coniferous plantation of national trust. These angels looked like anorexic porn stars (most of them were, did my research). However, I liked the moment Judd tore up. <br /> <br /> P.S I love and admire Tom Savini but HE CAN NOT ACT
