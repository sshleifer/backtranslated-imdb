Want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not this movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good comments seem to have been written by fake thirds (badly disguised). The authors of this film seem to be trying to synthesize false interests. <br /> <br /> This film is not a fake documentary well done. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The film is so mean that I can not imagine someone who knows the subject in a fun way. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are subjugated in this way, you must hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> great satire of taboo subjects but because of its constant pathetic banality.
