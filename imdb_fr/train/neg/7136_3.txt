"A total waste of time" Just launching some explosions, non-stop fights, exotic cars like a deranged millionaire, slow-motion computer-generated car crashes and finally a Hugh Hefner character with hot chops, and mix up a blender and you'll have that sorry excuse for a movie. I really made fun of "Dr. Evil" as a strongly fortified compound. The plot was somewhere between absurd and absent. How many millionaires are willing to bet $ 25 million on a car race? Answer: 4 but have not they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility? This was written for pubescent males, it is played as a video game. However, I enjoyed landing the Gulfstream II in the desert.
