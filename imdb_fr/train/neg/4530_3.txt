SPLIT SECOND could have been a good movie. A story about a homicide "road rage", has very young Clive Owen give a pretty good performance; BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers are staging their own film with silly camera work and a really horrible editing. The camera jumps from one notch to another in an unsuccessful attempt (I guess) to reflect Owen's business, family, and traffic stress. It really gives the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers do not want to make a good film, but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography, we must not waste time on this tragedy.
