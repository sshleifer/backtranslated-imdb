I was not completely impressed by this movie. This is originally Sin Eater and should have stayed that way, since that's all we talked about during the last half of the movie. I do not even know what the first 20 minutes of the movie have to do with the rest. It was very slow and that's what was done with the choice of Robocop (Peter Weller) as the main actor. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say you have to check if you like the Catholic religion, but do not expect an exorcist or a stigma of this movie. It will surely collapse after a few days and the news spreads.
