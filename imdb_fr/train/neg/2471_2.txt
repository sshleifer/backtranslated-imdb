I remember when I was little when I was away at camp and camping under the stars. There was always someone out there who would have a good story to tell about the woods around us that always slipped me. Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I looked at him in the hope of being one of those movies whose supernatural haunts people in the woods, much like the stories told at the camp. Well, to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three goes to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and looks like no hut in the woods, and runs up against a deer. Well, it seems that the local hicks hunted this deer in particular and are very unhappy with the inhabitants of our city. The film spends far too much time following the family's daily activities instead of going to the heart of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes that we actually took action on "wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay very far from this movie. This will leave you wanting your hour and a half back.
