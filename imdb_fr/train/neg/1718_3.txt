I've read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, as her costumes and locations echo the gang's photographs. The death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche are particularly welcome. This actress looks exactly like the pictures taken that day by Blanche in mourning over her dying husband. However, this film is still Hollywood and our anti-heroes are beautiful until the end, even after being shot (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like not a cheerful cheerleader at the time of his death). The scenario is tedious and the acting of mediocre actors, especially the main roles. Very disappointing. Stay with Beatty and Dunaway. It may not be "the true story", but it's a very good movie.
