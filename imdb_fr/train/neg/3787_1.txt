I must be this guy in America who did not like this movie. I guess it was just not my style or something, I just did not see what fascinated him the most, it was * hardly entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements of the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a guy who came from nothing and who then becomes a drug lord. A fairly simple way to describe a whole movie, and that's exactly how I feel about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just talking about a movie about mafias / drugs / criminal groups does not automatically make a good movie, do not forget to tell stories.
