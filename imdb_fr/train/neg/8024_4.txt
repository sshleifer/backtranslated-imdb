Sitting to watch the 14th season of the baccalaureate ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew that I would be in a time "interesting". I had watched some of the previous seasons of the baccalaureate passing; watch an episode or two and miss the next three or so. I find that the Bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, although its quality and morality are often lacking. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" details the career of Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, a love as true as the one he loves. one can find in a drama show dating from a whole season. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to get to know them a little, but it is mostly superficial; How well do you know someone in 5-minute conversations? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the beginning, at least to the public. He noted that he did not want only love or good time, but that he wanted a fiance or a woman. We can only assume that he made it clear to the women in the competition. If so, this could explain, to a certain extent, some of women's actions. Women are super competitive. Although they do not even know Jake yet, they are always looking for the price, whatever the price. <br /> <br /> Not only were women competitive, but they were also confident and tired. Threats, stabbing and warnings of "Attention!" all show that these women were not there to have a good time either. Jake pointed out that he was not only looking for sex appeal, but "a link". However, the girls did everything to try to impress Jake with his sex appeal. They arrived at home in skimpy dresses ?? low or short cut. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to retain their sense of decorum, others completely missed this memo. A girl, Channy, noted that Jake was a "good guy" for whom she could be a "naughty girl". She went on to say that Jake could land on his "track at any time". She was reproached by the other girls for her provocative statement that showed their point of view on these situations. <br /> <br /> A reality show could not be so bad, could it? In addition to the obvious problem of sexual attraction, there are other problems that hinder this seemingly harmless spectacle. Is this the right way to find a future partner? to compete for someone's attention by showing extreme proportions? Unfortunately, this is what the United States has reduced to this day: pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment to which many girls are linked to Jake themselves. Some girls in particular seemed to be too attached. One girl said, "If I do not get that first impression, she will kill me!" As mentioned before, they do not even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses not to be eliminated. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some problems with the attachment to Jake. The other girls also noticed it. After a burst of Michelle, Vienna said Michelle was "in a state of mental depression and we have only been there for an hour." Michelle had the last rose of the evening at the first show ?? lack of little elimination ?? and was extremely emotional about it. The other girls thought it was just ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and from there it took off? reality show. It shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we did not watch the programs and give them good ratings, the networks would not continue to broadcast them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough Americans are hooked. One thing is clear: America (in general) loves reality TV and its pitfalls. <br /> <br /> This brings me to wonder: why do we even like reality TV? What attracts us? Is it because we see similarities in our own lives, or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever attracts us, we must be careful about the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality shows are bad; However, I say that we must evaluate each one of them. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for the review: Season Premier and Episode 2.
