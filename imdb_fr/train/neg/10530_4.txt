A disappointing musical version of Anna and Margaret Landon's king of Siam, herself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, introduces Deborah Kerr as a schoolmistress and widowed mother who went to Siam in 1862 to accept a guardian position the many children of the king - and perhaps teach one or two things to the Royal One in the process! The Stagy image starts well, but loses energy and focus quickly. Yul Brynner, who disapproves of his triumph on stage under the name of King, is an imposing presence, but he is used - according to the concocted narrative - as a jester. Kerr keeps her cool and dignified, even if she has to synchronize her lips with Marni Nixon's voice. Perhaps having already played this role to death, Brynner seems to have left nothing out for the on-screen translation, except Bombast. In the second half, with Anna and the moppets featuring a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is pretty ridiculous, and the songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein are mostly heavy. Brynner won an Oscar for Best Actor, but it's Kerr who keeps this bauble over the water. Too long, heavy and "out of fashion" in the worst sense of the word. ** from ****
