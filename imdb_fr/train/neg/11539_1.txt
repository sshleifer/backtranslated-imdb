It's the biggest crappy load I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was watching "28 Days later" and "Magnolia". This film makes absolutely no sense, except to see sex scenes / rapes really sick and twisted, Gillian Anderson relieving himself of the edge of the road and each sentence of the dialogue to use the word "F" two or three times in it. His acting is extremely cheap and his budget is very low. My friend and I finally turned off the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save that crud. DO NOT WATCH !!!
