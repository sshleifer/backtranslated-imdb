Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who has more than she expected when she went to a pool party with a handsome colleague. When her date and her friends jokingly say that they belong to a "killing club," Maddy takes it seriously and climbs directly to "level 3" by hitting a woman's brain in a garage (for having damaged his car!). But does Maddy also wear a plastic mask and kill other members of the group or did someone else lose it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally called MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly designed, full of holes and spirals completely uncontrollable before a ridiculous end spin and out of the left field. Part of the dialogue is downright ludicrous. Rochon's performance was not a problem, but the distribution of support was atrocious. However, I managed to miss this completely entertained Full Moon release. There is a lot of skin and blood and this is the perfect movie type to sit with a group of your friends and separate them. Horror fans will also appreciate the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (parents of Debbie) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
