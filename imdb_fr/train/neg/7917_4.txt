"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad policeman (Penn) with a bad attitude and bad disposition who has a bad guy in a very bad way, up to his cajones in quick drying concrete. While waiting for the cement to dry and the film to understand what it is, we are periodically shaken in time, without rhyme or reasons, to be able to look at the events that preceded the cement. Cement, a boring music film as a whole, suffers from a lack of history, a clumsy performance and the most ubiquitous faults in the film; no reason to worry about it. A time killer for the couch potato needy at best. (D +)
