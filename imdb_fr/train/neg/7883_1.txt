The misleading cover, the title and the tiny hidden copy of Power of Prayer prompted me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and attracted me. I REALLY loved it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of the film, the film started throwing things that were unprepared and that made no sense. My first thought was, "This is not written by someone who can tell a story." I ended up watching some parts of the movie again, thinking I had missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, everything was BORING, ANNOING, DIALOGUE THUMPING RELIGION that made no sense, did not say anything and was annoying to listen to; I turned off the sound and made a quick advance to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVDs with the Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions labels. <br /> <br /> And I am a practicing Catholic.
