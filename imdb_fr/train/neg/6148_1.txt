First of all, the movie was not at all true to the facts. I just saw the documentary a few days ago and the movie was not at all the same. First, Nash was a genius of mathematics and that's what the film should have been about not telling the story of a healed man who found love in the end, and so on. There are also a lot of scenes that were simply wrong - the scene on which he cycled on campus was in his early days at university, but not after. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit this role at all since he does not look like the intelligent / individualist type, so he really could not play one. It would have been great to focus more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on life too dramatic. At this level, ABM was too Hollywood and too superficial to be excellent. Personally, I think he was neither crazy nor paranoid and he was interested in something because people of this caliber tend to know more than we "the little mortals". 5/10
