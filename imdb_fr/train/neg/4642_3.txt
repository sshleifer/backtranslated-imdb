I saw "Rachel's Attic" thinking that I would be in a pleasant visceral walk. However, this should not be the case. Visceral, yes, but nice? It would be a big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (very briefly) as one of the bad guys in the movie. How they drew Mr. Hansen into this work, I'll never know. The idea of ​​the story is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. The only thing that is worse than that is the special effects. YIKES !!! I saw better effects in a primary school room. Give up, Mr. W, it's time to change careers ... I heard they're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few well-made Indian films coming out of Michigan ... and Rachel's Attic is not one of them.
