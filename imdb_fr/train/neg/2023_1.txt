As the summary indicates, you've made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard on a role play. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you late? If you went to save your best friend and someone decides, by the goodness of his heart, to help you, you have a great debt to this man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other, it brought them closer to friends. They were not gay lovers like those you get angry at. And to let you know that the game is set in a medieval period. At the time, women were only preparing meals while the men were fighting. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the military today? This game contains a lot of realism, even if you are too slow to grasp it, and you need to create solid proof rather than ignorant assumptions based on your misplaced act to interpret the story.
