Ashley Judd, in a leading role and I think her first lead role, shows her rebellious nature in this slow feminist soap opera. Wow, is it a vehicle of political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a fervent feminist in real life, she had to cherish this scenario. No wonder the leftist critic, Roger Ebert, liked this film. <br /> <br /> Unlike critics, I'm glad that Judd rose from this stupid bud to better roles in movies that entertain and not preach the liberal agenda.
