The Teamo Supremo is made up of three children: their captain, Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battle skin (buza! Chika! Woopa!), Their outfit and their movements. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wanting to be heroes and playing at this game. They also lead a normal life and have family and school responsibilities, but most of the actions take place far from the school battles. The bad guys all have rather unique and singular traits, such as Mister Vague and his men who seem to never know what their plans are but act anyway. From an evil robot to a bad baron, the three must meet them and put an end to their diabolical and often strange plans to gain power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is rather nice the style seems to be simple on purpose. The funds overlap and the buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty good and the show is not too bad, although the style is not my favorite style. <br /> <br /> The intrigues are almost always absurd and ridiculous, but after all, it's a cartoon and you can not blame them for that. However, it would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or pepper Ann.
