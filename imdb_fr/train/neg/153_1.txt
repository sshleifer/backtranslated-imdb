"Spielberg likes the smell of morning feeling, but feeling at the expense of narrative honesty - no one should like that." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "The color purple" takes place in the Great South in the early 1900s and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film begins with girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic paradise that is quickly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif ?? innocence interrupted by men ?? pervades the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film then launches into a series of short sequences. Celie is revealed to have been twice pregnant with her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, sees her newborn child kidnapped and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent man who rapes her several times, forcing her to cook, clean and look after her children. <br /> <br /> All these horrible scenes have only a short time in front of the screen and are surrounded by cinematic effects to pixie dust, a complex symphonic score, an incongruous comedy and a camera work excessively exuberant. The cumulative effect resembles the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape film, an unpleasant aesthetic that led Stanley Kubrick to point out that "The Color Purple" was so nauseous that he had to extinguish it after ten minutes. Ten minutes? It lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> It is often said that the film deals with "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but that is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a lesbian in the closet. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of liberation and self-discovery of women, portraying men as violent bullies who prevent women from succeeding. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is to allow women to associate in a kind of lesbian utopia, black femininity and women's independence celebrated. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's film, however, recounts the story of Walker's lens of comforting American mythologies. It is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity triumphs over the natural cruelty of men. A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, misplaced comedy moments inserted to make him look like a stupid fool. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist menstrual programs, the cast is composed of lustful men (always radiant with evil smiles and dull grimaces), stereotypes tits, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which blacks are naturally children, willingly and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which blacks are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class problems are totally invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are totally inept. It's not the Old South, it's the Old South, derived from "Gone With The Wind", from MGM Muscals, "Song of the South", from Warner Cartoons, "Halleluha!" and banned Disney movies. In other words, it is the South seen by a child raised on television in the 1950s. Everything is so caricatural, so racist in its way of reducing these human beings to dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that the black novelist Ishmael Reed likened him to a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the typical Spielberg style, the film ends with the healing of family ties. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by reconciling all the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Beyond Walker's black hate letter and Spielberg's strange caricature of dark life, nothing is shown to us about the black community. We only have the vaguest ideas about how one of these characters makes a living and no idea how they interact with other members of their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera jumps all over the place, struggling desperately to get our attention (one of Celie's kitchen appliances seems to belong to a "Home Alone" movie), with every emotion gone, the director never stop to watch something or to allow a little of life just to go through. Add to that Quincy Jones's ridiculously "white" music and you get one of the strangest movies in film history: an angry feminist pamphlet filmed by a Disney and Griffith-style white Jew, portrayed by a black man trying to mimic John Williams. <br /> <br /> The absence of white characters is also problematic. Consider this: The men in this film are not described as being tough on each other, they do not dominate women because they are brutalized by a racist society that reduces their manhood. No, they are cruel by nature. And women, whether they suffer calmly as Celia or rebellious and tough as her sister, persevere and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it happens among the oppressed; rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse that has led to domestic violence, which is forcing black slave women to perform the same tasks. as their male counterparts (while fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African-American domestic violence is largely driven by economic factors, women unable to provide for themselves and their children. <br /> <br /> So there is a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film, one character tells another that, not respecting his wife, she ended up being beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks must return to their African roots to regain their dignity and that it is their fault if whites crush them unjustly. That is, respect each other in your poor minority community and you do not go against the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Failure to deal with sex and lesbianism, inappropriate music numbers, an endless sequence loaded with superfluous visual pizzas, an incongruous comic book activity, emphatic musical cues and an emotion brimming with passion contribute to rendering "Purple color" worthless.
