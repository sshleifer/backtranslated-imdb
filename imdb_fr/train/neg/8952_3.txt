After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece all my life, I now have 37, but I have never read the book, I am totally confused as to what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts discussed in the novel, as I'm sure most are, but only by hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery and, even with that, I'm still no more aware of the 1984 story than I'd ever seen it before. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is incredible, Hurt & Burton offers beautiful performances and the general atmosphere of the film is wonderfully dark and sorry. The prostitute scene was an incredibly dark movie. <br /> <br /> Now, for the disadvantages, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There's a war going on (unless it's about propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. Some names have been mentioned (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? What is he doing? Where is he from? where does he work? why is he changing reports? why is he not in the front line? Why does not he eat food in the canteen? What is this drink he drinks throughout the film? Why is he so weak and sick? Why does not he wash the brain like the rest of them? What's the problem with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little story back would have been nice, without scrub, essential for those who like me did not read the book. Without this, it's just a confusing and hard-to-follow art-house movie that lets you constantly guess what's really going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been dissociated and misrepresented, and the constant chatter of Big Brother's screens is flooding dialogs in places, making the task even more difficult. I admit it may have been an artistic choice, but it's still very boring. <br /> <br /> I also know that this has already been mentioned, but why all this nudity? It seemed completely free and seemed to have been thrown there to make up for the lack of media coverage. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not stand the way Hollywood feels I have to explain the script. for word these days. We are not all brainwashed fools, but it's a little too far in the other direction. I can only imagine that this is totally based on the fact that you have read the book, because if this film is really the "literal translation" that many people have said, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 is hailed. like the classic it is. <br /> <br /> It's undeniable that it was light years ahead of its time and predicted just about every change in our society so far (maybe that's what it's all about. was a bible power?), but many science fiction novelists did the same without leaving gaping holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> I guess I have to do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy. of the book if I want to make sense of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I am very disappointed with something that I have been waiting for years.
