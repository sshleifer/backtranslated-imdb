I could not believe how awful this movie was; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought, "Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I was wrong. Everyone involved should be downcast and ashamed. <br /> <br /> I realize that there are not many big roles for older women, but the script of this movie was so inept, clich√© and confusing as I am. I'm surprised the development has started or Ms. Keaton thinks she can make a silk handbag with that sow's ear. None of the characters had a hint of credibility and was unbelievably incredible. The acting game was like drills in a BEGIN class - I stared in horror at the wide open mouth for most of that time, asking, "What were they thinking?" Very, very sad that it happened to that. Do not waste your time.
