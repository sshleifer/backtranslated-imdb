This ambitious film suffers more from the illusions of greatness of the writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material (Altman "Nashville", "Lumet" Network "), this heavy elephant takes too much time to get anywhere.Some misguided detours on the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) do not help things, nor is the level of performance unequal, particularly bad: William H. Macy, whose character and screenplay could easily have been eliminated, Julianne Moore, for his unconvincing anguish. see us John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will be enough)? Tom Cruise is doing well in comparison? Holy Roller, his misogynist and dirty mouth, was quite funny. The script was so full of "F" bombs that they lost their impact in no time - do not even mention that horrible soundtrack, full of Aimee Mann's tasteless and boring voices. of "One", a maudlin number to begin with, made me lose my head at the beginning of the film. I should have listened to the handwriting on the wall and saved myself for three more hours, when I was pushed to the brink of hell. An interesting feature, which I have not seen in other magazines, is the band's best performance, the unknown Melora Walters, in the role of Claudia, the creature of the damaged coke that self-destructs. Its credibility has far exceeded all others. This film was taken too seriously and did not know when to end.
