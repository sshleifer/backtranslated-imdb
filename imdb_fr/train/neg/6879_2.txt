Rosie spent a lot of time on television talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that Africans and Spaniards were and she knows it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen, looking like a black chick with light, clear skin (with a dad, black cousins ​​and aunt obvious) pretending to recognize the real essence of which makes the Puerto Ricans modern, but barely mentioned. how Africans have influenced the way their Spanish is spoken, the food and the music. She is so typical and I have lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything she does. Moreover, since she wants to dance around her Africanism, she does not need to assume more roles associated with darkness (that is to say Lackawanna Blues). We can find a proud black Latina next time (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> To the Puerto Ricans here who said they were African and not "black". ...Thank you. We, the "blacks," certainly have nothing in common with "you," so there is no lost love. But since you are probably in the United States and have benefited from the civil rights movement, we would like to see you deny any decent human treatment you receive, with the blood, sweat and tears of the "blacks" with whom you do not share nothing. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not waste our time trying to disrespect you because we know the media like to exploit the weak points and the behaviors of all. minorities to maintain stupid generalizations. However, you have obviously fed the hype that you are white or better ... you are not. Also, you feel somehow forced to believe that black culture is BETTER ... again, you're wrong and have to take a vacation off the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Trust me, none of these Blacks wants to claim your "culture" either.
