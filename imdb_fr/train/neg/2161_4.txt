Ira Levin's Broadway smash arrives on the screen with barely meat on his bones, a mysterious plot with just a few tricks and tricks but nobody deserves to worry about it. The frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own; his sneaky plan may include the killing of the talented child, who has Caine's unstable spouse in his arms. The first act in which everyone is presented is an atrocious death, Caine doing everything in her power to keep up. Dyan Cannon is a bad idea of ​​what his wife (she is too smart and clever to be called pretentious) and Christopher Reeve (center of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the best writer. These three characters, and the troublesome neighbor of Irene Worth, are so indefinite that what happens after the recording is barely recorded even before the beginning of the second act. Sidney Lumet's management is confusing and fuzzy, the scenography unconvincing and poorly lit, and the finale is a total disaster. The actors have trouble giving substance to the script, but with such a fine material, we see only their painstaking efforts. * 1/2 of ****
