"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related. The pre-suites are on "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are a classic of the trendy horror of the 80s." Demons III: The Ogre "is a very stupid, bored and cheap monster.I am very confused with the writer is" Demons III: The Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are writers of poor quality and stupid, but the bored ghost of William Shakespeare or the demon egg of the spiderweb or what Huhuhuhuhu is dreaming of the girl) I am really sorry, very very very very boring.I bought the special DVD box entitled "Demons "on 3 different films titled" Demons III: The Ogre "," The Other Hell "and" Black Demons ", which have no subtitles and subtitles The Best Buy store in the city of Downey cost $ 14.99 Why are Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti poor writers who make such a stupid film as "Halloween III" do not have the monster Michael Myer but people wear Halloween? I am very confused. I really like "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are better than the boring st upside "D emons III: The Ogre" is not part of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2" are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
