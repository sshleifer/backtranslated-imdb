When I watched the show for the first time, the first episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the "mysterious" stereotypical vampire and Sookie introduced herself as an independent woman. However, the show skidded from here and the once-interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personality, as well as their acting abilities. In episode 5, Bill's frowns are so low that his face is a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she only reacts to the joy of losing her virginity. Personally, I think they forced the main characters to go to bed too early in the series. The way they teased each other was something that appealed to me and could easily be played with a little more. As soon as Sookie loses him, she struts around like a total god, thinking only of Bill's libido and the size of his appendix. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just becomes ridiculous. His actions are never really explained except that he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never deepened, if there is love. So far, it seems that sex is the heart of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yeah, vampires usually have the same sex, but hey. Every five seconds, I see a kind of hump happening. It was not really a surprise, since HBO is still trying to move from a soft core porn to a decent TV show. Bill would come out of the mud and just do it with Sookie for no reason, what was going on? I laughed so much that I almost pee myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into the details. All the events that occur are usually unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like is the minor characters. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I keep watching the show is for the development of the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Without sex and the main characters, the show would be much more profitable.
