Although William Shater can always make me smile in all his projects (and I particularly like him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), this show is entirely devoted to glitter and dancers, screams and jumps. > <br /> He does not have the intelligence of Millionaire, nor the flair of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and nonsense to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I watched it, of course, just to check it. I watched it for more than 45 minutes and then had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part was William Shatner dancing on the stage. He is funny !!! unfortunately, this show will not do it. <br /> <br /> It's a given
