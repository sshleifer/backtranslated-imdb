Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a blank format that gives full justice to all that has merit as a film. Unfortunately, that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It is composed of competent second-class members who perform as well as expected under the circumstances. It is efficiently directed, entirely on sound scenes and sets standing on the bottom of the studio. It sounds ok, but it is extremely complicated and barely 80 minutes, it is still very padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the first cob attack of the first GI was surely an attack too much. <br /> <br /> The case about Julia's choice to marry Pete rather than Tom is never equivalent to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she has no reason to be jealous of Julia (she is not so). <br /> <br /> Julia's feminine intuition is presented as if she were leading to an important plot. development, but this is not the case. Likewise, Pete's investigation of cobra sects and Tom's brief suspicions only serve to fill the time spent in front of a screen. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured as a mystery, but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story unfolds. The characters must discover what we already know with care. <br /> <br /> The end is particularly lame. Julia is threatened purely by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom arrives in time to save her, we do not even know if she has been threatened. He then simply disposes of the cobra in the same way as the previous victims. <br /> <br /> It's a little unimportant pipsqueak in a story that I found myself wondering how it was started. the studio heads. So that came to my mind. Someone said, "These Val Lewton films have been very successful at RKO, so why not make one like that?" <br /> <br /> The cult of the cobra is clearly inspired by Cat People: mysterious, troubled, A metamorphosing woman falls in love with the hero, is apparently cold, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the friend of the hero and dies at the end. But "modeled on" does not mean "as good as" - by far. He copies, but does not understand what he copies. <br /> <br /> It's obviously trying for Lewton's discreet and suggestive style, but this approach does not follow the story. Lisa is not Irene. She is supposed to be strange and mysterious, but she has no mystery. We see it after the first attack in Asia, so recognize it immediately when it comes to New York. There is never any doubt about its purpose. Nor is there any ambiguity about whether or not she turns into a snake. <br /> <br /> Then, during his nocturnal prowling, we get not one, but two attempts to "bus". Do not separate them either, because the director does not understand what makes a "bus" work and, in any case, it happens to the stalker, not to the harassed person. <br /> <br /> These Cat People's Echoes give Cult of the Cobra the slightest distinction it can have, but they only draw attention to the gaping gulf between the original and the imitation . <br /> <br /> Plagiarism is perhaps the most sincere form of flattery, but I doubt Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this lukewarm passer-by came out.
