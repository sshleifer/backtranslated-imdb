It looks like two movies: one is a long and pretentious saga about an actor that is taken up by the roles he plays; the other a brilliant social comment on a middle-aged divorce that is taken up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another deal apart. She hints at the need for bonding, her certificate in massage and her desire to play modeling. I love the glimpse of her shabby apartment with a kitchenette behind a curtain and her awful, alluring outfit of a navel-hooked top revealing the belly button. <br /> <br /> Do the actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know they are Oscars for imitating people with disabilities, wearing a lot of prostheses or pretending to be angry. The Shakespearian scenes (coming and going) are embarrassing and dated. As are the scenes of "madness" where Tony seems distracted while listening to his own voiceover. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not an aristocrat. In a recent scene, he clearly explains that he was a choir boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
