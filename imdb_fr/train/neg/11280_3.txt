This film is about the life of a man who goes wrong. His business fails and he can not put his wife in prison despite several attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is total chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so badly told that I simply could not understand it. It's a shame because the sets and costumes are well done and are visually stimulating enough. The plans are well composed throughout the film. However, these redemptive features still can not compensate for the bad plot and the bad story. I am amazed by the big names who have agreed to play in this film. It's such a waste of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid it !!
