The show intrigued my husband and me: a strong-willed south-end lady with a complicated personal life was settling the crimes on behalf of the Los Angeles police. The first season was television not to be missed for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life during the second season have become so boring and unworthy of the strong character that we have stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tried to hide from her life. mother does it cut off. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why would a strong, middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that she would not do it. Plus, my husband and I choose the villain with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white man or woman who has been brought into the scene of a murder or an idealized family. Can not writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer shows that do not betray the characters and do not insult our intelligence.
