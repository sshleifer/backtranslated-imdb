While others may claim that by viewing other works of Bilal, we will appreciate better this film, it is a major failure. He does not stand alone. The plot is a mishmash that confuses symbolism with substance. Here is an idea that starts with a specific story. Then build the symbolism around him. We start with two different stories, this woman who is becoming a human being, a "god" judged for some reason, but trying to make one last time on Earth, and this mysterious character of John who seems to develop a kind of "hotel complex". "Just beyond the limits of the city, why?" None of these questions has an answer, but we do not care, no, there is no development that wants us to be sympathetic to a character in the world. history, as close as possible to Jill and even in this case, the development is at best uneven.Unfortunately, the film is taken as a whole visually impressive (which is the case), but at the expense of motivational development. would love to see this text rewritten by someone who could stand out a bit from the material and not have to feel that every picture should be in the picture.
