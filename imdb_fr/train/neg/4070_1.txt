Imagine the embarrassing college kids goths in a scat movie, add a pinch of history and a lot of dreadful actors, and you're still not close to the gravity of this movie. <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, worse acting. Attempt of shocking horror infidelity. Everyone to whom I have shown this is a little depressed. Sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are simply something you want to finish as quickly as possible. The last sex scene is simply foul, even before it reaches the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those who likes to watch movies they hate, that's why I chose this one. But for your sake, save time and avoid this horror. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
