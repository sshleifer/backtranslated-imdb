OKAY. Not bad to film if it was an original script. BUT THAT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of "in this story, there are no women, with the exception of Foulata and Gagoola", an introduction of Haggard that producers, directors and writers do not have including? I mean, it's pretty simple English. I understood it at 10 years old! The beauty of KSM lies in the fact that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds: colonial Africa, the ruthless desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be more than enough even for the poorest producers. But no, they have to take a look at it. Pathetic. Suggestion to all of you, poor souls who really thought it would be close to the book. Abandoned. Until a Peter Jackson candidate comes in and "do it right", you can also continue to re-read the book. BTW, there's a book in a row (actually a pre-which) called Allan's wife. It gives the history of the history of Quatermain. It's a little scary but good.
