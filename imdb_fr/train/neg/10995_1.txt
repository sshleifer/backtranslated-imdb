Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the last few years has probably seen commercials for this movie. The first time I saw commercials for this movie was in 2001, it sounded like fun, but I was not going to call the number on the TV screen and order it without seeing the movie beforehand. I thought I would wait for the film to be available for rent at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and in the DVD "for less than $ 20", there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD only cost $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I went home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the bursts of laughter to begin ... and I waited again. The laughs never came. <br /> <br /> I agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick, hopelessly tasteless, poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious waste and is, in my opinion, the worst film of all time. No stars.
