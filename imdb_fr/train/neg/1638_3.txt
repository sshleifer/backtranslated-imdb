I could not wait to see Amanda Peet in another good role after recently renting "The Whole Nine Yards" - well worth the rental, by the way - but that was not it. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the trailer for "Whipped" was kind of funny and that the plot around three New Yorkers in excess of twenty-one was going to be manipulated by the lovely Mrs. Peet was worth it. So, one afternoon, I convinced two friends to come and see this film with me. This criticism is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act, we have the three main studs, telling their conquests in a restaurant. What should have been funny, or at least revealing, comes out rather pathetic. Were the three men and their meetings redemptive? <br /> <br /> [Even though I do not mind making nice films, I wondered why no one was doing it. in the dining room was turning when the stallions spoke loudly about sexual and scatalogic details. Do they do this every week at the same dinner? You would think that someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other guests notice him in a scene. But this is just a configuration for a typing line. All the other guests are deaf.] <br /> <br /> In the second act, the three tenons fall for Mia, then develop a brain rot, not questioning each other about what is really happening between them. . And I kept wondering, as the males continued to behave as they had been, what qualities of redemption did she see in them to stay with them longer than a single date? Does it start with brain rot? I was hoping that Eric's character, the married boyfriend, would become something more than just the annoying punching bag of this act. His role is clearly to provide advice on marriage. But why do they take the trouble to talk to him when they do not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act solves the plot, but at that moment, I was looking at my watch. My friends told me that they were still waiting for something really funny to happen and I had to accept. The scene that explains everything was adequate and managed to explain all the questions and mysterious elements of dialogue throughout the film, but we were checking their list. ("Oh, okay, that's why Brad did it and Jonathan said it and ...") <br /> <br /> What we laughed at laughing was stupidity intrigue than anything fun. Even taking the credits was not very fun. In the end, I had only the desire to put people away from this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
