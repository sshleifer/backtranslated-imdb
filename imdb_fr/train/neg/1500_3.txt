Oh, it's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like this is a porn evening with drugs that led to the resolution of making a movie just for fun. I mean, you can see topless porn actresses, have sex, and then be killed by human mutants. There is a lot of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, that's half the person she was" and the accidental killing caused by panic. But you can also find fun things like the intestines pulled in someone's buttocks and a guy running in the woods and then beheaded by a wire tied between two trees (which produces a metallic sound afterwards). as in cartoons). Somewhere, there is a market for people who go beyond pornography, they really need to know what an actress is, the genitals are not enough. As a result, you get many summary autopsies on killed bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have very small roles and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted by accepting a role here. I think it's a movie you have to watch with the button in advance and watch only the juicy movies, just to remember the class C horror movies from the old school.
