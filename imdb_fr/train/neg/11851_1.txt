It was a disappointment - none of the nuances of the original. The British just seem to be able to make a really disturbing film without any histrionic stories of the American version. The original series combined both scary stories and subtle performance with great attention to light and settings. I have watched the series several times and I am always fascinated. <br /> <br /> Just another mediocre adaptation in the sense of the terrible adaptation of "Cracker". Join BBC America or BBC Canada and discover delights such as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then search for "Wire in the Blood" for even more unobtrusive and stylish performances by Robson Green. Hollywood needs to watch this actor!
