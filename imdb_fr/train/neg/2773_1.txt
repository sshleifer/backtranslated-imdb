Until then, Gentle Rain was the film that I found the worst in history. It has been replaced by this "blockbuster" from Asia. He has a "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He is out of shape to be the naughty flying flying and magical he is thrown here. The rest of these people could not get out of a college play. No pictures were forgotten in the dialogue and the special effects were recalled as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's pretty easy to see that someone in Asia had some money and had to create a vehicle for some actors. they wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or a writer who needed credit. I guess any career with this movie in his credentials <br /> <br /> Do yourself a major favor and do not watch this movie. One hundred Thanksgivings could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The only fun scene was unintentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. The king? A beautiful and old Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? A six-foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for that. They expected that we would not notice that this poor man's brother, Jet Li, was a midshipman, Pierce Brosnan, in a cheap "Injun" wig, straight out of an old 1940s western movie. .
