Peter Fonda is so intentionally upset as an actor that his readings of tear lines annihilate any irony or humor in the dialogue. He talks with Brooke Shields about sassy beards and non-spiritual repartees as if he were a block of wood with receding hair; even his little touches (like touching a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) do not reveal as much a character as an uncertain actor, realized by himself, an uncertain filmmaker. In the south-west, around 1950, a mediocre player (not exceeding a little cheating) wins a Lolita, an orphan or future teenager, in a botched poker game; After procuring a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the two quarrelsters become prospectors. Some comedians are filled with a tired drama comedy, as well as a strange but interesting cameo from Henry Fonda as a graying canyon, the two main roles being followed by caricaturist killers who will stop at nothing until they hand on it. map. Shields is very pretty, but even though the camera likes her, she has no presence on the screen (and her hoarse voice has no bearing); every time she opens her mouth, one is inclined to cringe or to bend down. * 1/2 of ****
