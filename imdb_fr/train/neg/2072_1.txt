I rented this movie tonight because it sounded like a funny movie. I thought you really could not go wrong with an Ex Girlfriend concept with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confused and useless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that every turn the writer continued to throw garbage. Also, the writer continued to throw a lot of toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenager boy could like. <br /> <br /> It seems like it would have been so easy to draw a story from Fatal Attraction Super Hero ... but I guess no. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy as it was announced. You could not take a child to see him and you'd be embarrassed to see him go out with him. <br /> <br /> If the writer had been able to tell a basic story about the high concept and clean it up, the film might have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
