Certainly, I find Al Pacino a guilty pleasure. He was a good actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently did an irreparable overdose. I was hoping that this film, about which I had hardly heard anything grow, would be a pretty little gem. A political thriller, urban, intelligent and engaging, neglected, ahead of its time. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that covers his plot of so many characters, names and problems "realistic" to the scale of the city, that for a moment, you think his plot is so vast and implicit. that once you have discovered the truth, it will amaze you. In reality, however, these intrigues and digressions generate relatively familiar urban markings, such as the corruption of power, two-faced politicians, a mafia with police links, and so on. And theoretically, this configuration allows a thrilling tension, fear that none of the characters are safe and that everything can happen! But again, this is really not the case. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we still have several monologues about "confessions", intended to form a modern ensemble. in a way, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of missing names and reports and a spider's web of lies and cover-ups, the public is generally treated as a somewhat satisfying developer. I do not think it stays at City Hall, and although it's a very complete movie, I do not think it's really rich.
