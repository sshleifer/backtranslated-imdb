I am a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking about when he directed this film? Normally, if he made a bad film, I could blame the scriptwriter or the director, but in this case, it's all him. The sucking of this film is entirely his fault. This proves that not even Heston can make a story of Shakespeare interesting. I lost 2 1/2 hours of my life in this rehearsal festival and I will never recover that time. It's by far the worst Heston movie I've ever seen. If you're a fan of Shakespeare, this movie may be entertaining you, but if you do not waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
