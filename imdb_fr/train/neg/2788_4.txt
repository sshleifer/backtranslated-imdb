Many things have been written about Purple Rain, the musician's bio film, which seems "essential", but I'm here to tell you that the film does not deserve its praise. <br /> <br /> Prince is a great musician and music is the field in which Purple Rain excels. Even the score is hypnotizing, and if it was shot only as a concert film, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not the case and the film poses some problems. <br /> <br /> First, it's the dramatic game / In writing, the character of Prince "The Kid" is supposed to appear as a sort of mysterious solitary composed of few words, unfortunately, this is presents in the form of corny and incense. A good lonely character should at least have moments of conversation. Unfortunately, the character of Prince rarely has a few words of dialogue in the film and it is hard to believe that he would get the girl that way. Everything seems to go a little far here, which is a shame because you can see that this character is terribly conflictual and lives a very complicated live, but we are never allowed to enter. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this film is how much this is happening in concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to be relegated to the background, which makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a two-hour movie where, apparently, half takes place on stage, especially when characters set aside for that. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize: it's not a very good movie.
