This John Wayne Lone Star western debut is a bit more valuable than the ordinary avatars Wayne had made for Lone Star so far. On the one hand, there is his old friend Paul Fix; Fix, being a much better actor than Lone Star's villainous standard, brings an environment that is sorely lacking in the surrounding area, instead of the usual hesitant line readings often delivered to these players. The plot, about misidentification, stealing at source, and murder, is as banal and superficial as one would expect in a low-budget Western Western of the 1930s, but the beauty of Wayne, his Casual charm and sense of the line go a long way to make it more enjoyable. Eddy Chandler is not quite credible as Wayne's "partner," and there's a gag about something happening every time Chandler and Wayne are about to embark on a fight that becomes tiring. On the other hand, Wayne's love is portrayed by none other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the early "Little Rascals" celebrity. She is a 20-year-old, blonde and cute as a button. Most Wayne leaders in Lone Star's "B's" monograms were pretty bland and colorless, but Mary is beautiful, cute and, yes, sexy. There is a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to bring her a bottle of "tonic nerve," which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up 'at the top. shelf. Wayne is eyeing his little back when she climbs the steps, then again when she goes down again, then again a few minutes later, when he asks her to come up and get him another bottle, is surprisingly racy for a film shot in 1935 try to hide the fact that he is checking his buttocks. Anyway, it's a little "B" interesting, not great, but not as hectic and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final shooting is not very well managed, and Chandler gets a bit irritating after a while, but overall, it's worth a look, if only to see a cute Mary Kornman and sexy.
