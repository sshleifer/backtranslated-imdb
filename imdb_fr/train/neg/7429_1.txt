Who I am No, I'm not kidding. This is what is written on the video box. <br /> <br /> short version: A pretty woman smiles. This, for some reason, forces all men to kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... I can not find Ariel ..." She's right behind you, silly ... <br /> <br /> Most of what we can say about this horrible little opera of space has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> A lot of nerdy actors playing mostly convicts arrive after the first selection of actors is removed very quickly. Then they are eliminated in the same way. Each scene is broadcast about fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a straw drawing to see which actors had the most time in front of the screen and the biggest salary. The extraterrestrial virus / hologram / virtual reality / problem seems physically helpless and does nothing. Why can not she stay in the computer instead of doing her "teleport a vampire" routine? (In fact, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or if she had done more than looking at people, that's all she's ever done.) It's enough for all men to kill each other Go understand ...) <br /> <br /> It's not really a space movie. There are many more shots of the old western trail, the 1950s Easy Rider Trail, the Black Film Nightclub, and even a beach jog in an imaginary country, none of which have really deep or even meaningless. The nightclub scene is in black and white, of course. Worked with "The Wizard of Oz". It does not work so well here. This is probably a good thing, as these few shots they show of space are unreasonably ridiculous. You'll probably cry during those moments, especially after seeing this swirling "spaceship", which looks like it's about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are doomed or do not have their personality, but because they need serious drama lessons, except for Billy Dee Williams who really looks depressed and helpless, probably by being in this book ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, when seen with friends, will provoke extremely strong silences, especially when the nerd throws his comic doubler attempt (including the phrase on kissing a meteor in French ...? Maybe not ...) <br /> < The original virtual reality girls are "killed", which means nothing because they are not even real to begin with. Well, the other "characters" are not, either, but it's irrelevant. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that adorns the video casing is a kind of thing that looks like a skull-horror-extraterrestrial (added green filter in addition to that, to give him more ... uh ... green look), which is actually android after he's killed and finally has nothing to do with anything else on foot. <br /> <br /> Another strange chord that I noticed. Whenever there's an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes highly pixelated. I do not mean a little pixelated, I mean huge blocks of about 1/16 the size of the screen. Sensational.
