A friend told me about John Fante last summer after we had a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski - an author with the same advantage and the same humor, except for a generation earlier. "Ask the Dust" was the first book of Fante I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant writing about a sad and frightened young writer who posed for himself and the outside world as a too confident and talented author who did not know how to write about the experiences of the world he had never experienced before . In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, without knowing how to win the graces of women for whom he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he agrees for his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer and how he finally ends up with nothing, but the story of his failed love endeavors is mordant and real , without touching Hollywood late. The adaptation of the film remains faithful to the book for a while, but plunges into the cinematic trap of persistent love through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a fool and that Camilla is mad with joy, and that their love has never been and will never be the reality, no matter how much the one and the other wanted to find one in the other. This film tore apart the true meaning of the story and replaced it with schlock. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown was able to read this book and make it a movie that was wrong.
