Where was I now? Oh yes, "the man planned", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8 <br /> <br /> Oops, sorry. Yes, "the projected man". Well, it's a British science fiction party that does not talk about anything. A guy with an orange head projects on a laser, gets the contact of death. At last he disappears, the end. In fact, the film is not even interesting. Sad, deafening, starchy, stiff and boring, "The Projected Man" represents 77 good minutes of nothing, featuring person. Dull like dishwater. Mate like door dust. Dull like Ethan Hawke - we are really talking DULL here, people! But wait, regarding our deaf cousins ​​on the other side of the puddle, the MooCow now make an appropriate critical for "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ...... ...... .. <= 8.
