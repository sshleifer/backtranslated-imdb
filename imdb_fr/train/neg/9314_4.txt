Well ... all in all, this movie was worth almost nothing, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up becoming a comedy. I had just rented this movie last night, while my friends and I went to do a blockbuster in search of a scary movie. It was certainly not what we were looking for, but it filled us with humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially this girl Tracy, every time she is in the closed room, orders the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they act. And also, when the clown looks through this black paper and grabs Mark, he does not even look scared, even though the clown caught him and started to attack him. And seriously, would you be just JOGGING if you were chased? I would sprint for my life! (Although anyone can probably beat this clown because it weighs about 300 kg.) Not to mention that the effects are not so bad, like when the clown cuts Susan's head in the forest, then every time he throws it into the board. place with Denise and Tracy each time Denise throws her head back. In addition, as in the commentary of the previous type, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I do not even see why it was even included in the film. So what, was this film shot in 2003? The music gave the impression that the sound had been made as in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Did not even really look professional. Half the time, it seems that the camera can not even stay stable when it is supposed to be. Overall, I must say that I enjoyed the movie. I would not recommend it though if you are trying to find something that scares you, but if you are looking for something that you may be able to make fun of or have fun with, I would recommend it for sure.
