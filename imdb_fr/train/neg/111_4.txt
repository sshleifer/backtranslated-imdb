My interest in Dorothy Stratten led me to buy this video. Even though there were excellent actors, there were simply too many secondary intrigues to hold the interest. Plus, it was just not interesting. The dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story turned out too much to be credible. I was quite disappointed that I think I'm one of Audrey Hepburn's latest films. I will always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was too pathetic here.
