I'm afraid you'll notice that the vast majority of people who rate the film's ranking as 10 are highly Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you need to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The characters and their illogical behavior annoyed me. The premise of the film is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it is Jesus who is at the base of morality is false in itself. A scene shows the main character telling a boy that it's wrong to steal, then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who had taught us. I find it shocking: should we believe that "you will not steal" came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And flying was acceptable before that? I rented the Netflix movie. I should have understood the nature of the film from the comments. Never mind.
