Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the summary in one line says it all. The samurai from Melville is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better, much better! <br /> <br /> In the "Samurai", Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in a cage and steals cars for his work (with so much suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death with dignity and is shot with an empty gun. The world has changed and he realizes that there is no room for samurai. <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill as many people as the Ghost dog. But I guess Jarmusch liked "Leon" or even "Desperado" of Rodriguez a lot. So he added that too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like a ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> What was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the unique, original thinking in this movie? <br /> <br /> I do not see the point of making copies in carbon (celluloid). <br /> <br /> A rating of 4/10 from Macaulay Connor
