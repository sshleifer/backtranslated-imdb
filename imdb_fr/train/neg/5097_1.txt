Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It begins to sound interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were (maybe something had failed me, who knows?) And I realized that I had witnessed 26 episodes consisting mostly of a hatred of characters, egoism and self-pity. It actually switches between extraterrestrial / robot fights and these dark and depressing flashing scenes where one or more characters can just say or scream "I hate / you / that" 10 to 12 times in a row. <Br/> <br /> I really do not see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learn or grow, by the way). I wanted to kick them and tell them to lead a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling has not changed during the last few. Shinji really has the kind of helpless despair that makes people more angry than charitable, and Asuka is such an infuriating skill that I wanted to break the television screen every time she saw it. Oh, and more than anyone, these two hate everything and tell me that often. <br /> <br /> I'm also a big fan of cartoons and manga, and I've never hated it so much. I read that the creator / author of the series wrote this when he was suffering from depression, and I can believe it; it made me feel depressed to look at him. Is this the goal of this series? I ask honestly. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if you suffer from depression, why not just write a book or a biography about it, instead of mixing it with extraterrestrials and mechas? This extraterrestrial war plot, as far as I know, does not lead to anything. <br /> <br /> Finally, as I'm really fascinated by the number of people claiming to love this patchwork of deadpan plots, I can 'help you, but ask yourself how many of them find that it's good, and how many say they do it because they were told it was the case.
