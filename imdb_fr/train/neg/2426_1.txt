Trust me, this is a movie you want to avoid and that comes from a big fan of Denzel Washington. What's frustrating is that it's 1/3 of a BIG movie. The first part of this movie does an amazing job of putting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he paid to protect. The trailers in this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So, I do not hide anything when I say that the film degenerates into an almost untouchable mess after its kidnapping. Whatever the director has tried to accomplish, all he has managed to do is make the audience literally nauseous. Fast, frenzied and unstable cuts ensue for the next half-hour, while Creasy tracks the culprits. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that they just get you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story implied a change in the character of Creasy and meant that a different movie would follow. Well, he was right. The film that followed was a complete and unsatisfactory shit. The result is a depressing end that ruins even the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
