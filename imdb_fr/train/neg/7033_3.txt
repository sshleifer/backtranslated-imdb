Black Candles is rather a jumble confused of the same director who brought us "Vampires" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others ... I only note those that I saw. Anyway, we have a couple making love, then somewhere nearby, a pin hangs over a voodoo doll, then it pierces and the man starts to sing. I do not know if it was good for one or the other at that time. Fast forward to where the man's sister came home to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something like that, and of course, everyone except her is involved in something that happens to be the worship of the devil. It's really hard to tell who is who at certain times during the film and it sometimes becomes a bit confusing. To spice things up, there's a simulated bestiality scene (I hope it's simulated) with a black goat, which will certainly please the crowd. Ugh. This sometimes echoes "Rosemary's Baby", less the baby, because the hostess always gives a tea to a woman and the place gives off an unpleasant odor of satanic herbs, because that is what is noticed. However, herbs are not the only thing that stinks of this movie. The end seems to be back at the beginning and many viewers might be wondering where they went during the middle part. It's not unassailable, it's just not very good, and I guess it depends on what you like to see in movies, and there's not much here that has done much for me. 3 out of 10
