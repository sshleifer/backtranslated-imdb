The only reason "The Norliss Tapes" deserves all stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Aside from seeing Angie Baby attend a "Police Woman" show, there is nothing else to see here. <br /> <br /> THE SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> David Norliss is hired to write a book on the supernatural. One day, he mysteriously disappears after phoning his editor to suggest that he came across something that puts him in danger of death. The whole series for which this unfortunate pilot was written was apparently meant to be a series of flashbacks via the "Norliss Bands" - a set of audio tapes recorded by the writer during his investigation of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian beetle ring from a local occultist who assures him that the bauble will give him immortality after death . We soon discover that the ring itself does not grant immortality. Instead, he just revives the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt and run into the city, draining pretty girls with all their blood. <br /> <br /> The blue face, the yellow eyes and the grunt Not having heard of the last time you watched the cartoons of "Scooby Doo", the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) a dark night. She escapes and, through a common acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get his help to solve the mystery behind the mysterious reappearance of his late husband on his estate. <br /> <br /> Is this guy a vampire? No, there is no vampire in this story, despite what you have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? I do not know We only see him attack, never collect. Why? To fill the second part of his offer of immortality. It turns out that the resuscitated sculptor will have the right to live forever if he builds the life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. Once completed, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as a gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "Norliss cassettes" were not collected as a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see in my summary, the story is a derisory and ill-conceived mess. The actors' game and the dialogue do not offer better. It's not even a candidate for a prize "So bad, it's good". Sometimes it's bad, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> After years of hearing clandestine rumors about the great merits of "The Norliss Tapes", I was very happy to find it on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I had not prepared for the fall. <br /> <br /> After watching this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume that the applause you have heard so far from other readers of the BDIM is coming from those who review the show based on weak memories and nostalgia for youth. Or maybe they are just loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Anyway, they offered you deceptive reviews on "Norliss cassettes." <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
