Visually interesting, but falls flat in the department of originality. This tedious exercise of technique wears out soon after the first battle. Jude Law has the charisma of toast, but in his defense, this movie contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the scenario is so poor that he continues to get you out of the movie and made me think about work, bills, my dogs, etc. Paltrow is also made of wood they get. It could have been saved by a captivating dialogue with a film noir or by the upper camp. The only complaint I would make about the technique is that the black and white film (sorry, the computer) would have helped, because it looks like Turner in black and white. Just a big mess of clich√©s. I would rather break my femur than go through this endurance test again.
