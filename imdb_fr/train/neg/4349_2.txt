This film is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is an excellent film. Goodgfellas is not but it's one of the best crime movies ever made. This film should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe the speed zone. Remember these jewels! The only reason this film was made was to capitalize on the cult of the original. This film lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard. There was no nice character and it was the fault of all those who were responsible. I hope that RISE TO POWER will win every RAZZIE possible and will even be able to invent new categories to enable it to hold a record. After watching this movie S @ * T FEST, I sat down and watched Carlitos' original way of getting rid of his bad taste. After watching this, I would like Pachanga to come and pull me out of my misery.
