It is hard to say what is the worst thing about this series: the misinterpretation, the bad acoustics of different parts, the bad CGI, inappropriate sets for the period, the bad scenario. It would have been nice if the script was a little closer to the original story - there is enough tension and enough content in Beowulf to provide a good amount of quality material and a better script line that the writers would not be able to imagine. <BR /> <br /> And why introduce a new strange weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive locks? <br /> <br /> I see that this film was made in "only" 21 days. This is seen in the lack of quality. I'm starting to think it's a general (mediocre) attitude adopted by the science fiction channel (and others) when it comes to making movies with classic tales in recent years. <br /> <br /> What a mess! !
