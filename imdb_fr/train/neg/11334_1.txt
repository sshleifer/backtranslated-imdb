Here is another blasphemous European story in which they explode the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) We are witnessing here a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This film won an Oscar for its foreign film. This is probably because history has made Catholics and religious beliefs in general extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as an idiot. No wonder the Academy dominated by the laity loved this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is an excessive idiot who plays the role of a guy who renounces his religion to marry one of the four girls presented in the story. The girls in turn seduce the student of the "seminary" (who claims to have studied for six years but says agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this film? !!! <br /> <br /> It's a shame and another great example of the secular and progressive bigotry of the film industry around the world (not just in Hollywood).
