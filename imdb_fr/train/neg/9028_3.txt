I just watched this movie and I must say that with such a premise and such talent, this turkey is here! This film was lent to me by a friend and I looked open-minded, mainly because he praised the story so much. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a retired fighter pilot ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? It is assumed that Anthony Quinn's character would hire him to become his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner approaching a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a big Mexican businessman and Costner gets carried away with him. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten on the approach of death and Costner takes him to the meeting, which happens to be with a partner of Quinn! But nothing comes out ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why did they have horse sales with partner Quinn if nothing was to come out of it? <br /> <br /> After leaving Costner, Madeline Stowe's character becomes a whore, then she attacks one of Quinn's men who was paying for a ride ... she stabs him with her own knife, and then she was transferred to a convent! No explanation as to why she was moved or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted in such a low scenario and poor editing !! I only looked at it because a friend was the owner and let me watch it ... I'll throw it at him for the 2 hours I lost in my life looking at the fucking thing!
