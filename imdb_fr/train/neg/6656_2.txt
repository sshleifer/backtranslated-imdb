It gives me two because I liked it as a child, but it became so redundant that I was just beginning to hate it ... I can not give a descriptive overview, because it would be a thing to repeat after the other. do not say anything that everyone has not already said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it's pretty naughty, with the kid with the boils to this babysitter twisted to the stupidity that goes around and around in. I have a cousin who loves this show and he is the strangest and most stupid person I have met. This show should be removed from the air. It's always the same again and again ... They have to put on better shows on Nick. I'm getting really tired of things like that.
