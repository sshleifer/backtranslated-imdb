OK, forget all the technical inconsistencies or physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally launched by a weird robot with a gold heart. Forget the hideous special effects and the one-dimensional characters badly built. Just look at the premise of the story. The very reason why the film exists in the first place, and you will see how much this movie has been restored. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-old kids who watch this insult to intelligence and get married to it. The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message he tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse is that cable movie channels KEEP THE SHOW! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does a sensible person think that people would like to see this sore piece of celluloid many times, let alone see it at all? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to not even spend the energy to look at this thing. It's just not worth it.
