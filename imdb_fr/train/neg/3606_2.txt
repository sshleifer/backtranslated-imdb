This film is the worst film, but it is very important to me. This is how a slasher movie should be. This is happening in a university where there seems to be only a handful of students. The teachers are more stupid than a bag of hammers. He is full of good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√©d that it's hard to believe that I was able to predict the lines in quotation marks. The nicks have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitals. A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters who deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for fun. Get a crate of cheap beer and some friends, watch her and laugh.
