What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across "Quite Ugly ...", I was delighted to hear that this drama was commissioned. <br /> <br /> I obviously had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even if it does not fit. It is impossible for me to read the book and adapt it to this piece of slag. <br /> <br /> Whole characters are changed, situations are abandoned and to see the spectacular burglary of Parlablane reduced to Nesbitt. the quick chin and the opening of a bay window ... it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think about what will happen with "Country Of The Blind" if it's the reference ... <br /> <br /> Please , avoid it ...
