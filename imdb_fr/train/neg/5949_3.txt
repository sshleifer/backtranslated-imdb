It is not unusual to see American films redone abroad that fall flat, but here is the reverse !!! This is a terrible redesign of the American film "Wide Awake" of the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and fun! "Liam" on the other hand is just strange. I have to give credit to "Liam" for one thing, it's to show that I made the right choice by changing religion!
