I think I should start by saying that almost all work styles can be entertaining in part. The real test is whether it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave the review the analog title. Most of us would agree - even those who, like me, love to read many blogs - that blogs can not be compared to good writing for many reasons. Similarly, FEM can not be compared to a good cinematographic realization for a number of reasons, and I think in reality that it is a poor example of independent filmography. From beginning to end, FEM looks like a reconstituted vlog. (Heck, even MySpace has some pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - I do not do it - I would go look at it. FEM, although certainly more granular than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that there is no interesting story. It's like looking at the banality of life, which, I think, would be best, is very naturally boring. And yet, the creators of FEM want us to applaud, their very postmodern movie about making a movie. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm leaving not caring at all. I am shocked to find that I am interested in taking the time to write this review, even. It's not that FEM is downright bad, because it's not bad; There are some moments when I smile or think that maybe - just maybe - something interesting is about to happen. It's rather that it's downright ... mediocre. I am so indifferent that it is almost appropriate to make an oxymoron: a passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators / "actors" of the film will free themselves from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them will leave life and move on. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to spare and you have nothing to do; if not, go your way and do not worry that you missed a great undiscovered talent. You really do not.
