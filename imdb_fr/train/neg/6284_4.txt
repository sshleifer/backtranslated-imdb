I liked the basic principle of this film, that's what pushed me to look for it, but the problem I quickly discovered is that we know pretty much what will happen in the 20 at first 30 minutes (doubles will come from behind the mirror and take everyone to your place.) <br /> <br /> There is not really any twist (which is good), but the final revelation does not make much sense either (how can it be invaded by uncertainty and fear of the entire movie, if it is a bad id of beyond the mirror?). <br /> <br /> Of course, the scenes "beyond the mirror" were scary when they first appeared and the murder of the blonde is also scary, but finally seems to be a movie looking for 'a story or a more engaging scenario, stacking the atmosphere on the best scary sound tones for 80 to 90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact, it becomes pretty dull.
