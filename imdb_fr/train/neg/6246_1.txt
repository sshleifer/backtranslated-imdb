This touches some interesting points .. But! - He does not demonstrate all the "exclusive" studies presented. Who are the "friends" and "small groups of scientists" who collected this data? - What's going on with all of Al Gore's biography? For example, how he enjoyed playing with cows at the ranch or that his child was hit by a car ... too bad but ... what does this have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I saw MUCH better things, in a lot less time, on Discovery Channel .. I really do not understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you have lived as a bedrock, this "documentary" should not be news to you ... it's only old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is is getting popularity points. PS I'm not an American, so do not even try to say I'm a bush fan: p
