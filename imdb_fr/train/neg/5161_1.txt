My life is about saving animals. I volunteer with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not even kill an animal to live longer. I can not even kill a spider, I put it outside. The scene where the children throw stones at the bird until his death, with Sooner in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and haunted me ever since. It just convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The end - adoptive parents adopt earlier - does not buy back the description of animal cruelty. Why would someone want his child to see this movie?
