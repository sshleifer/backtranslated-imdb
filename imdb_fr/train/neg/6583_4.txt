Interesting idea and scenario that did not work. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you may be as dissatisfied with the end as I did. I did not really know who to turn to in the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored as a detective, the rest of the characters seemed so unidimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been kinder, we might have liked to see the plot and the culprit brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, from a sweet girl to an opportunistic cocote. I do not understand the moral message of this film and, as a crime novel and thriller, it does not work.
