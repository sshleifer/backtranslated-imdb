For my life, I can not understand the blind hype and dedication to this totally unbelievable movie ...... and I think I have the necessary qualifications to say it ... I'm a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ... This film was totally unreal and had obviously been written by someone who did very little research on life in the army, in combat, at a level of team or platoon. <br /> <br /> Trouncing around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD cleaning buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper is the qualified Buck Sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy, then I let two guys take me without shooting or hurting me ???? Get Real .... I carjack an Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with 9 mil. so much like a scratch or a confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no adherence to the {military} military protocol and no resemblance to any military unit I have encountered. Totally incredible and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who, unlike this poor film, are not a crazy adrenaline seeking yahoos, but highly skilled professionals who do incredibly difficult work.
