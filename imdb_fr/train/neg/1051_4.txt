Although Frank Loesser's songs are some of the best that Broadway has to offer, they are jostled by the lethargic staging and uninspired presentation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz - when it's over, it hardly feels like watch a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's melodious but difficult melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, Adelaide's star movie, ends with Adelaide's (Vivian Blaine) conclusion of the belt while she is sitting. a lounge chair; and the false spirituality of Stubby Kaye "Sit down, you're rockin 'the boat" has her assistant choir in folding chairs while he's just there.Mankiewicz eliminates all the fun by letting the static scenes last too long and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has nothing in the minds of her films like All About Eve, and part of the blame has to be attributed to those responsible, who are pretty much all gone astray: Marlon Brando seems puzzled as to why he plays in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a guy too kind and has nothing that makes it so essential (the songs are not suited to his style) and Jean Simmons records to Hardly the way a Shirley Jones could.Only Blaine, like Adelaide, the star of the lovelorn, commands our attention as should a Broadway pro.The colorful art direction is Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy decorations.
