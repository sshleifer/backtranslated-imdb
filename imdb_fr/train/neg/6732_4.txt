I discovered this film on IFC and thought it would be interesting. For the "little" love stories, some of the stories that drag in this movie. The fact that none of these women had names suggests that the actresses were talking about their own sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit that I want to start seeing more romantic views of first sexual encounters, as in "Strike! (1998)", when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances began asking questions about her presumed first time, and Tweety has asked: "was it beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some might think that reenactments and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think that would make things worse. To get my attention, do not necessarily have hardcore porn, but I was expecting more.
