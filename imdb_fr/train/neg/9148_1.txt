I was looking down 100 Imdbs because I thought I had never seen anything as bad as the Outerspace plan 9 or the Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur beat both. <br /> <br /> This film, among the countless films I've seen, is the worst film in the world I've ever seen. Poor staging, bad characters, horrible acting, horrible story There's no reason anybody other than Sam to say anything positive about this movie. Sam was a boring actor but his staging was so bad that he could upset Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work. Unfortunately, I have to give him at least one star, but he deserves to be continued stars.
