Sheesh! What a terrible movie. Ladle camera work, a scenario with more corn than that of Kellogg, and acting so as to be able to open a pig farm with. <br /> <br /> To top it off, he does not know who to turn to - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - put on your soap box the risk of smoking each time someone lit a cigarette, my God, and in another embarrassing scene, we have the bad guy, Lobo, forcing him, his brother, if you want, "friend" to do a striptease wearing a bikini. Try to explain this to the kids ... <br /> <br /> Add a treasure Island-cum-Jaws-like story too artificial, and you'll get a movie so funny by chance, it's nice - I should not not expect a DVD Special Edition at any time, though.
