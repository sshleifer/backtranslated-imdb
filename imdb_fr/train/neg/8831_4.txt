Having heard so many people raving about this movie, I thought I would try. Aside from being incredibly slow, which does not bother me as long as the wait is worth it, but that's just not the case. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and most of this film does not sound right. The reaction of the 4 men goes from shock, from horror to looking for the body to become completely indifferent while they are fishing. If they were certainly the kind of men who would fish with happiness, they would have just reported the body and discovered after their fishing trip ... why the devil attach the body to a tree, go fishing and say then to everyone you found the body 2 days ago? It's so hard to watch a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the population, well, you might think that at least one of them could be curious about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except underpants, what scenario leads to this? If she was raped, then why always panties? If she was raped with her clothes, then why take them off, block the panties? If she has not been raped, then why undress her panties, leaving all her clothes ... leaving you evidence to eliminate? I really can not think of a realistic scenario that would lead to this other than killing someone to steal his clothes so you can fill your bulk sales stall! Oh, well, that's right, but it's just because, despite the bad scenario, the acting is powerful.
