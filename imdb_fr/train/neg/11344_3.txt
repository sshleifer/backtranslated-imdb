Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2 impressed me a lot, but maybe it's worse than both titles. First, I did not like the animation, the caricature of Saturday morning, worse than in some scenes. I liked some characters, including Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was really nasty in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was not at all a subject of writing and her animation was a bit ugly. Also, his fellow artist, Lars, was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit overnight. The voice skills were very good, especially Barry Bostwick in Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined me. There have been good times, but the whole plot has seemed puffy and strongly suggests an extended TV episode. In the end, an extremely disappointing sequel to the most memorable film of Disney movies of the 60s with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give a 3/10, it just was not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
