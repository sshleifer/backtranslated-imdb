It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main storyline, which were not as clear as they could have been. Perhaps there were too many activities and a lack of ability to rule everything. The acting was acceptable, some were stronger than others and even the strongest had poorer moments. It took me a few months to cover the entire movie because it did not catch my attention and the flow was just bad. I just finished watching the movie and I'm happy to have done it because the film finally starts to move and has some continuity towards the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was below normal. I would recommend it for the screenplay and maybe a little candy for the eyes, and I mean a little bit.
