This film is usurped in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when they ripped this movie. <br /> <br /> A terrible game, bad makeup, mediocre effects, a tiny underwear (1960s). I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is hard to understand because of the makeup. The assistant says things like "not you" that sound like NACHOO !! (think of sneezing) It's just a bad speech. The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what "projected man" means in terms of conspiracy. However, I missed part of the beginning. <br /> <br /> What happens with this minimum of 10 lines on the display ??
