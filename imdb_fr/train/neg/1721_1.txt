A meteor hit Crater Lake (hence our title), awakening a Plesiosaurus, which will then nibble the population hick (California, this capital of the world.) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster", who managed to escape MST3K. Featuring a squeaky acting game, a decent stop-motion beast and more, this is a dreadful episode of the 1970s low-budget movie and monsters. <br /> <br /> The movie is guilty of many crimes, Arnie and Mitch, two uncomfortable rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They buzz, fight to store "banjo music", women on Google and act as pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
