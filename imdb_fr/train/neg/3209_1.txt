I also saw this incredibly bad anime movie at the Science Fiction Festival in London. If you MUST watch this show, do it with a wide audience, preferably after a few beers, so you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Cremator is in the hilarious dialogue. The animation is awful. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It may have been a good idea that the producers hired at least one person who was not color blind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say, this movie is a failure at all levels.
