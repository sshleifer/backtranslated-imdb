"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but sometimes funny and charming mid-80s horror parody with very familiar names in the cast and a handful of authentic laughter opportunities in the screenplay. Two Bozo journalists from a tabloid tabloid newspaper are sent against Transylvania against their will to report on the supposed return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are a few small gadgets and adorable details to discover left and right in the film, such as a small guillotine for boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes used to pour cream and sugar at the breakfast table. However, the film does not have the expected success, with jokes and parodic situations too long. Roger Corman's "Transylvania Twist" production, released four years later, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodic to the classic universal milestones of the early '30s, so be sure to have seen them if you want to understand all the gag and tiny references. There is a pretty original difference that indicates that Frankenstein's character behaves like an evil scientist mad with anger when he enters his lab. It is also revealed that he is in fact no longer a messiah of the Father Damian type who is only interested in the condition of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the weird guy playing Kramer in Seinfeld, plays the role of a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure that John Turturro's character in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by Richards' role here.
