I watched "The Eye" before watching this one. I really liked "The Eye", it was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror cinema. So, I chose this "haunted Bangkok" because it was the same director and it was rather popular here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Haunted Bangkok" are three stories of love, vengeance, ghosts, etc. I can not even complete the 10 lines required for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My opinion: 2/10
