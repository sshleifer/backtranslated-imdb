I watched this movie at 3am, the time of day when I am generally very open about cinema. But I still think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons are many. <br /> <br /> The acting is not that good, and the situations that occurred made me think of a poor 90s comedy from Chevy Chase. I mean, go, like the situation of handcuffs, and the situation of poker among the servants ... This movie was so obviously based a lot on the first, and it's OK. But if I had not seen the first before that, it would have been even worse. As the end, it came very suddenly, and I had the impression that I had no total closure ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this film seems to have been made only for explain the # 1, used to do something else good. The score is the same as in the first, and it did not look like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They should have handled situations with more style and class, but they did not have not and therefore, this film turned out bad ...
