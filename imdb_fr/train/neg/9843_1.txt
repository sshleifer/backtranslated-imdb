This is only the Robert De Niro movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie with a horrible acting game (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must make his films on the Mafia as always, as Scarface (1983) or The Incorruptibles (1987). I also liked Mission: Impossible de De Palma (1996). De Niro has also worked with Palma twice, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I thought the wedding party was good too (I did not watch Greetings). <br /> <br /> The scenario is really bad and not funny. There is no scene where I can smile even once. The film has lost a chance to be a funny style even a bit in a "Be Black Baby" scene and I do not really like the scene where a guy's sexual organ has appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! just the worst. I hate that.
