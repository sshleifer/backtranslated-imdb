Of the three titles of Jess Franco to join the official Nasty Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least worthy of note, being a terribly drab jungle clunker animated only very slightly by a little cheerful, scene of free rape and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> The gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the movie star Laura Crawford who is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to an isolated tropical island wild island that worships the "god of the devil" hiding in the jungle (a tall naked native, with bulging eyes, who likes to eat the heart of nubile female sacrifices). <br /> <br /> Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his veterinary pilot friend in Vietnam go to the island but meet problems when the perpetrators attempt a double center. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the natives of the island who offer it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco leads in his usual torpid style and loads of this ludicrous effort his usual terrible brands: gore shit, blurry cinematography, fast zooms, many crotch shots, blurry images, effects dreadful sound and flat fist editing. The result is a total mess that is a real struggle to overcome from start to finish (it took me a few sessions to finish), and even the sight of the succulent Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough. to make me revisit this film in a hurry.
