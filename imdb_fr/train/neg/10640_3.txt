From its uninteresting title to flat performances, Curdled is quite a commonplace movie. The movie won over audiences with the name of Quentin Tarantino and the idiotic and misplaced film Rodriguez / Tarantino "From Dusk till Dawn". These things do not make a good movie, though, and this is more than obvious throughout "Curdled". The film suffers from a lack of obvious ideas and tries to hide it with supposedly elegant murders and supposedly disturbing events. The score of Mexican music that accompanies many of the film's footage is obviously supposed to be cool, but it quickly becomes annoying; Especially since the main character is Mexican, it does not correspond to the tone of the film. The plot of the film is typically shifted and follows a gorehound who, because of his obsession with gruesome murders, takes a job in a murder scene cleaning company. It sounds boring and it is. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin is the only "name" on the list of actors, and even he does not make a good impression. He was not given anything to do in the film and, apart from talking to his victims and trying to sound threatening, he is almost ruined. Angela Jones or rather; the taxi driver of Pulp Fiction takes the lead as a young woman obsessed with murder and it is always clear that it is his involvement in Pulp Fiction that has earned him this role, not his ability to act. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she does not have the talent to direct a film by herself. It looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it was not for its Latin American accent; she would not convince the public that she is crazy at any level. Curdled is a hundred percent forgettable waste. Movies like this often earn praise for their invention or their comic black antics; but it fails at all levels. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino, a fan of William Baldwin, a horror fan or just a moviegoer; it is to miss.
