It was my first and probably the last Angelopoulos film. I was anxious to get started because it featured Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and was a film of Theo, which I heard a lot about. The opening was promising, a long strike on a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OKAY! but that was all. There was nothing left. The film had big holes and I do not know which one to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue, killing the action and the patience of the viewer, nothing happens on the screen for 15 to 20 minutes except this old lady who tells a story. All that is supposed to be shown by the action is simply told on camera by the old lady. In a moment, the television was heading towards the bar. They turn the corner and as soon as winter begins! Probably, shot at different days, continuity was leaking. Many problems with the story, it went from absurd to irrational, never sticking to a style, forcing the viewer to ask unanswered questions. Poor Mastroianni, whose role lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks, Albanians or Balcans would agree with this, the movies showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political disadvantages, just to make a film about "humanity" in red in another criticism. Much more to say, but no time to lose for a mediocre film, which was not a film at all, but the madness of a person impressed by a movie and paid with state money.
