Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that lets you guess what happened, when it's done on purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this film really gives the impression that they have everything for them. but the last 15 minutes are over, then they realize they have $ 5 left to finish ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend you do not spend money for that. If you watch TV, watch all the videos except the last 15 minutes, then move away and create your own ending in your mind. <br /> <br /> In reality, the film would have been better if it had just escaped, and come back with the state's Poice of Feds only to find that the city and the car cemetery were gone and that, obviously, she had never been there ... <br /> <br /> "If only I had more thumbs, I could give this movie 4 inches down!"
