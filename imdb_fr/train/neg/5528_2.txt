Since this film lasts only 61 minutes and there is nothing so good on television, I decided to include Revolt of the Zombies on the DVD to pass the time. Even when I realized the time he was coming, I was deeply disappointed. It started with the strangely optimistic quality of the opening score (what - no disturbing music?), Then the rather slow opening sequences. God, I thought a movie about zombies - even the 1930s - would have shivers (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, certainly) but that had none. Zero. It was scarcely dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate someone's fascination). Like the Zombie King, just as dull, this movie can be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
