It was crazy and it was so awful ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like that ... you do not have to watch them. people cut or eater what should I say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! the film is about people we do not know but who feed on humans! they have teeth blah blah blah ... is not that familiar? I can bet you saw it in another movie. the casting was really great but I think the scenario was really awful. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was totally awesome ... he's so talented ... actually I said horrible but I think it's because of horrible scenes ... let me explain it. have you ever eaten the language? but in the movie a person did it! it was really horrible ... anyway, I think the movie would be so good without this horrible human eater or cutter scenes ...
