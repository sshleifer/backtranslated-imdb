I must admit that when I went to see this film, I did not really have expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was totally and totally disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a very sexy shooter who tends to go out with some crazy girlfriends. There is a slight mention of a girl harassing him but that's about all for this character. Which does not really bother me because it would probably be as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> So in the subway, Rainn Wilson (whom I liked before this movie) convinces him to speak. to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least, because everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from "hot". Normally, I'm all for his acting, but even he could not save this movie. His character was nervous, unrealistic and rather annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him a comic, or simply desperate gay closet guy. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But hey, anyway, his bag is stolen from the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior he pursues after the thief. Now, we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or "G-Girl" as they call it in the movie. It always puzzles me to know what the "G" stands for, but we'll leave that to the discussion forums. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I suppose are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who has sex like this? They almost threw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion", let's say. It hurts my head, but not in the sense of "I think it's really hard to understand that". <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her "fucking", I had no debate about it. Apart from the fact that she can not choose the films properly, she can not play and is simply based on the fact that she is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would be out of the theater if he had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let him know that simply moving your head does not necessarily mean that you are acting. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scenario and the scenario could have used a lot of work or a match and a lighter fluid. In fact, I began to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying career. Overall, if you value your money and your respect for yourself do not waste your time with this pathetic movie attempt.
