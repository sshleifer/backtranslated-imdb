The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement ?? a $ 53 million movie that's worse than any episode of a 25-year-old bearish TV show. The plot is usable, but the insane pleasure is rarely found and the cast is quite atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more transient than the protagonist, Mr. C. Gainey sheriff, Roscoe, is a bland thug. Enos, of Michael Weston, boring, Willie Nelson, apparently of the ideal cast, seems to be waiting for the check and Burt Reynolds, stuck in a purgatory where he is condemned to relive his old films, It is a curious choice for Boss Hogg, but it's a good time with a rowdy and a hundred dollar bill. You know that a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic presences on the screen ?? Jay Chandrasekhar is far worse than the script or cast: apparently born without comic timing design, unable to do more than just two-step shots and seemingly unaware of how to shoot a car chase, let alone the honest stunt couple in the movie he seems determined to undermine the film of any sign of life before it materializes. There are some well-ordered postmodern moments that revolve around the Confederate flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in every episode, but no film reminiscent of when Hal Needham directed such things (and badly) can not be good thing.
