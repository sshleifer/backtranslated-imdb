While the original titillates the intellect, this cheap remake is designed only to shock the sensibilities. Instead of complex twists, this so-called thriller is characterized by sudden and seemingly random changes of history that serve only to further reduce it with each bizarre development. Worse than anything, replacing the original spicy dialogue is a spilled bastard, full of useless words of four letters, leaving behind a tasteless, but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - a broken promise. Michael Caine's perspective of getting a Keller-Sullivan graduation from Patty Duke is intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has only tarnished his reputation, first by accepting the role of this horribly reformulated nonsense, then by realizing a performance that looks competent only in relation to the amateur act of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the classic original, forget about its obsolete visuals and tips. Hunt him down, watch him and just enjoy a story and a half. As for the remake, pass this insult to the original.
