I'm a big fan of low-budget horror movies like this one, but come on! It must be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site, thinking it would fall to my taste in horror, but I got bored and turned it off. Let's see: <br /> <br /> from Home Depot. The masks were made from what looks like a tin foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was very good, I have to give it to him. But the burning moon of Ittenbach was better for a low-budget film. <br /> <br /> Acting: was horrible! Dubbing did not bother me. I find it funny as in "Premutos" (excellent film) of Ittenbach. The fight and action sequences were pi $ mediocre. <br /> <br /> Result: do not look at any Schnaas film. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same gore and the same subject. Check Premutos, Blood House, Schramm and the Nekromantiks.
