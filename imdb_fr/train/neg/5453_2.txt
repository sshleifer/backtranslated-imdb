OK, I caught this movie half way through but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.the. are.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially this guy who is now in the teachers and book group, even if he has at least proved that he can act if he wishes! (The part in which a person has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad filmmakers in terms of acting, screenplay and general plausibility) This clearly appears as a cash-in on Human Traffic, movie ever, it is at least original and had actors whose performance did not resemble that of serious but desperate GCSE students who are trying to get a passing grade. Not so much as Human Traffic, but a bit like a car accident!
