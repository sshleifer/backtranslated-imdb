I remember watching this movie many times when I was very young, and there were parts (a lot actually) that I did not understand. I think I saw her once in adulthood and then I understood these parts. The only problem with seeing him as an adult was that he did not have fun at all. So, what kind of movie is this? Is it a "children's movie"? Not hardly. It contains language and topics that are not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what each parent feels like living with their own children? Maybe, but why would not he focus on John Ritter rather than Junior? When a movie has a 7-year-old main character, in order to play well with its audience, it should be a movie intended for children under seven, otherwise older people will have no way of -years old would not want see a movie about a child who is year-round younger than them). I'm pretty sure this film did not do well at the box office, and that's probably because it was impossible to find a niche in the market.
