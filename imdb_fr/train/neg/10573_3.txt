I was submitted to this film for a class relationship in my school. As expected, it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Although it tries to be original by focusing on the adolescent father instead of letting the mother show the problems that the father would know. There was an interesting side, but it did not correspond to its originality, because nothing else in this film was original. We have the main character who has the elder sister who like in any other movie like this has something against him, we have the housewife who is waiting too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust so we have the father who has always left. Then we have parents who want everything and expect it to be perfect for everything she does. In the story, as I said, it's interesting, but the lack of good performance on the part of the cast and the lack of writing or story quality. Everyone talks about it fell into the clich√©: the little kid at school starts studying with a girl, they get together, have sex and then we have a little boy. It might have been better if the writing had been better and if the acting had been improved, I have much more emotion in Leatherface and his chainsaw than in any other actor of this film. It's really unfortunate that Leatherface movies are shit and horribly wrong. So far, the only interesting film about teen pregnancy that I saw was Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has been more fun while conveying the same message. As I said, the idea was original, most of these films focus on the teenage mother but she chose not to focus on the drama of the father, but again, the originality does not save not this film of mediocrity. I really hope someone will decide to redo this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just to make another similar movie because this one was wasted potential.
