Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm sometime after making "Apocalypse Now" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" thought when he made this flaccid movie. This gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle, embodying a woman who travels back in time and manages to remake her adolescence knowing all that adult life has taught her, and Turner, the rider she is, does what she can but this movie could not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> He does not even have a style, and seeing his director, one would expect that even if there is nothing else, he would have that. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
