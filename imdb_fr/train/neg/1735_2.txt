I feel that the producers of this mess were there to make the most painful and ridiculous westerns ever made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, you have beautiful color photographs and a beautiful and well spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who played quite well in an annoying role, writing so atrociously that no actor could give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were pretty good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and the scenario. <br /> <br /> What I hated: Stewart Granger looked so little like a Western figure, with his British accent, his neat outfit, and stupid immaculate white scarf tied around his neck. It made boring the way the city's people and his son constantly harangued and insulted Granger, and he never spoke or responded. I know we're supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerners as symbolic morality games, but this one broke the spell with ludicrous and unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst being the one where Granger miraculously, quickly and to himself only dynamite plants around a canyon pass that the villain's cattle will pass, then Granger plants himself at the perfect spot to be able to fire dynamite from far and wide to create rock slides to bury and scare the cattle and to the wicked, destroying all apparently, except the two main wicked. Then everything is in the plot, full of drama scenes. Nothing in the film seemed credible: I could not believe what the whole conflict was all about. The wicked drove his flock to the market and wanted the cows to chew grass along the path; I do not see why something could not have been solved. Do you need a land ownership dispute for this? Do not bother to see him.
