A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect but very nice (my rating was 7), created this trash can about New York. <br /> In Paris, I love you (J'taime) has created a feeling for Paris & this has been done in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie, I did not recognize New York, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 boroughs, I have not seen scenes in the Bronx, nor in Queens, there is a scene in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scene of fine hotels or theaters. There are a lot of actors, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest kind. <br /> <br /> The very few humorous moments are all sexual in nature or insulting to the many beautiful New Yorkers we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the "razzie" prize were much better. <br /> <br /> Notes: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> According to my way of thinking, I think the title should have been < NEW YORK, I hate you.
