This film is really brilliant. It is difficult, by the banality, to shit at such a speed that you do not even see common sense and common decency that humanity passes at full speed. But it does not stop there! This film strikes so hard at the bottom of the barrel that it bounces to the point of becoming a ridiculous comedy: here Kor Beergutted Conan wishing to play with the overabundance of neck hair is laying his sword as if there was no tomorrow I I am really surprised that there is a tomorrow for him, or at least for his beer gut). Do not miss this film, it's a fantastic adventure through idiocy and a pure willpower! And once you've finished looking at it, dry your eyes with tears of joy (or the tears of frustration at such an inept attempt to tell stories) because a stupid f00l gave $ 5 more to these people to give them a sequel!
