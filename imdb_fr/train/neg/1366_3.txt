** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The truly exquisite Sean Young (who in some scenes, with her hair lifted, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) strikes in her first moments in this film. Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to report a bust, his face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, once the bankruptcy is over, Young's tense behavior never changes. She is a fatally inhibited actress. <br /> <br /> Just compare Young to the interpreter who interprets her colleague and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to capture what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional, and comfortable at all times ... in that there is no apparent barrier between what she feels and her expression. It's an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the same way that you expect your neighbor to behave in a shy and conscious manner if they are suddenly projected into a movie. In the end, she does not have a clue. <br /> <br /> This important void looming in the center of the film, it remains for us to question the implications of the story. For example, after Miss Young was kidnapped by the criminal she drags and locked in a closet, she pushes the door when she is left alone. Certainly, she is wearing only a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychopath kidnapper who must come back at any time, would you go to the door ... or take the time to pass through her dresser, take out some clothes and dress? I suppose this and other scenes are trying to suggest some kind of mixed emotions that Miss Young's character is experiencing, but Young can not convey that kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some moving moments in the film. , such as brief police interviews with former victims of the criminal, but overall, it is a goal-oriented enterprise. It's a pity that Miss Young was replaced when she was shooting the pair of comic films that would have exploited her limits with a bit of humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY) because her attempt to play with real characters is strangely touching. See Miss Young trying to play, at least in this "thriller", is a sad show.
