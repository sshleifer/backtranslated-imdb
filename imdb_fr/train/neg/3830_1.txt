I do not know why I take the time to see this film wasted time. If you stay with that long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion ?? good, bad or surprising ?? do not It finally dies out after a dialogue and action steep, stereotyped, predictable. The interior scenes are so brightly lit that you thought that if the camera was zoomed a millimeter further, you would see the klieg lights. The costumes, the hairstyles and the ornaments are starched, pressed and impeccable. Are we supposed to imagine ordinary people who actually lived in Arizona in the early twentieth century? Comparisons of other critics with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least, this director has integrated his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. HARD MEN has for gore the free explosion of wooden personifications bites of bad guys with manicured nails. Huh?!? I can believe that Heston thought he could have done something worthwhile with this movie. (He manages to hold his weapon between his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he signed up for this parody. Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of the Westerns as we knew them? Watch THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST HARD MEN is a parody of an obituary in the West.
