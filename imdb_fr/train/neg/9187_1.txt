I've already watched some very bad movies, but what the heck did they think when they made this movie? The production team turned into zombies when she had the idea to make it, because you have to be completely dead to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and I enjoy "shoot 'em up", but the fusion of silly scenes from the game just made it ridiculous and unassailable. <br /> <br /> As most have already said, there was virtually no script and the acting was weak. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who notes this movie above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, otherwise she has a very distracted concept of entertainment. <BR/> <br /> I must say that the video store made me angry, which earned him such a boost, which led me to rent it. Thank God, I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in the movies. <br /> <br /> A type of comic book would be right if he said "The worst film of all time"!
