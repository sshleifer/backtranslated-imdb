It is not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this film. For several years Madonna has been able to act, but she can not. Guy Ritchie has been an excellent director for years, but he is mediocre. An embarrassment all around. <br /> <br />
