Forbidden as "naughty video" in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained a little notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found in the movie is its amateur character in all departments. The bleeding I could endure: dramatic play, mediocre editing, horrible direction, bad storyline, and abominable soundtrack were much more difficult to take. thunderstorm. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to a neighboring house. The owner of the house, an angry old lady, and her old daughter, greet the girls and allow them to stay a few days to recover. However, someone does not want girls to leave, never! One by one, they are victims of an invisible assailant. <br /> <br /> Taking a long time to get started and having some of the worst performances of all time in a horror movie (and that takes a number), Unhinged is really a horrible movie. The music is a complete mess (it looks like a three-year-old was dropped on a synthesizer) and, as such, it perfectly complements the movie. Some bloody scenes towards the end and some free nudity save Unhinged to get the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are a horror finalist (and unfortunately, I am), you will want to see this in order to check the Video Nasty Watchlist. But be warned, it's really, really bad.
