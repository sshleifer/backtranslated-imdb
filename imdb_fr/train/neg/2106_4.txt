Bela Lugosi is awesome as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one to have played a perfect role in this film, but not even a legend like Lugosi has saved the misconception of this film and unlike most of the old insane horror movies, this film does not give not really the mood. Even at the worst moment, none of Bela's films are mediocre.
