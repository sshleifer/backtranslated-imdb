This movie is just terrible !!!! Slow, slow action and wooden characters that should not have been there. The best part was the screening of Iron Maiden singing in a video at the theater and that's it. the end was worth watching and expected but it was there !! The characters in this movie almost put me to sleep. Avoid it !!!
