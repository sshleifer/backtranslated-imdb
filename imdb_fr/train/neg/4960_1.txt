I am a big fan of Batman comics and I became disappointed that I could not find Batman again: the animated series on TV. I was delighted to hear that there would be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode on the first day and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very mediocre. It looks like a cheap and nil Japanese anime. Once again, almost all cartoons today are like that. <br /> <br /> The character design is even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the Penguin is a master of Kung Fu, Mr. Freeze is an undead with an iceberg on his head and the Riddler is a Gothic look-alike Marilyn Manson (which is funny because I do not expect people obsessed with riddles and riddles to be gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is the Joker. They turned him into a monkey / crazy Bob Marley / Kung Fu fighter! The Joker is supposed to be the deadliest enemy of Batman, but in this show, it is hardly a threat, so his crimes are stupid and vain. In one episode, his plan was to put his venom Joker in dog food! Oh, what a pain! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the death of his parents, which is why he is fighting crime. This version of Batman does not seem haunted by the death of his parents and is not interesting at all. He is not a detective, but a fighter. If there is an enemy he can not defeat, he will not study it to discover his weak points like a detective, he will simply build a giant combat robot to defeat them. Often, this series does not look like a Batman series, it's just another brainless anime that does nothing but unnecessary fighting. <br /> <br /> What I hate the most about this series is what they did to the bad guys. They removed everything that makes them friendly and relatable and turned them into nasty, stereotypical villains. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a curative treatment for his deafness. By experimenting with himself, he accidentally turns into a giant bat creature. In this show, he is a mad scientist who wants to purposely turn into a giant creature for no apparent reason. Just about all the bad guys are like that; None of them, except about one or two, have real motives for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In comics, Freeze was just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the episode of BTAS "Heart of Ice", which gave him a new origin that made him a more tragic villain, three-dimensional and friendly. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as its real origin and it was even used in comics as its origin. Even this shabby movie Batman & Robin used it as its origin. In this show, he is a small thief of jewels before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He is still a little thief of jewels! Great origin. No wonder they used it above the one created by Dini. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not like this series just because it's not like comics, because I also liked BTAS, Batman cartoons. came after, Tim Burton's Batman films and, of course, Christopher Nolan Batman's superb films. None of them were 100% faithful to comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like comics or BTAS, it's the lack of depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this show so many chances, but the more I look, the more I find that it disappoints me. I regret the good old days when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.
