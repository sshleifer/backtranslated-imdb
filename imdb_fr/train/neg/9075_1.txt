The Slackers are named three college friends, Dave, Jeff, and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna, and Jason Segel, respectively), who are about to graduate from university without passing an honest exam, but ending it. This continues until the end, while the most sympathetic character of the film, Nathan (Schwartzman), understood everything. Nathan begins to blackmail to be reconciled with the girl of his dreams because he can not continue under normal conditions. The only problem is that when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and good Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch the film because its performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired just to be with her gorgeous look. The Slackers recalls American Pie with a different direction. The jokes are as superficial as in American Pie. But are not they all used? I think this film is a warning to filmmakers of the genre that they lack originality. All in all, some smiling moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzman) and subject. * out of *****
