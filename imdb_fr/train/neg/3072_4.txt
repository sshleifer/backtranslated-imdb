Margret Laurence probably did not intend to have one of her novels in the movies, let alone Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was a person who constantly questioned the social norm (Gainsay who dares, anyone?) And ended up sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols of the book (the angel of stone, the silver thread, etc.) constantly recall this struggle of the old and the new and the carnage (so to speak) that occurs all along the way. <br /> <br /> Although the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it's not really a plot story, is it?), I think it has missed the point of capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's challenge (for the challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much more raw than described, and Hagar's father could have been played more "traditionally", so to speak. If the filmmaker insisted on stronger performances, the film would make the problem clear. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why should we see cell phones, biologics and other modernizations? Are we trying to put forward certain points in the interest of certain points (for example, the Muslim girlfriend and the natives). Hagar and co. are all but politically correct in the book, so why should we see it in the movie version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send politically correct subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant for the novel (and the movie) seems to be giving the impression of hurting itself . There is also the public. It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old men as cute and kind. Why should laugh whenever Hagar is angry? I doubt very much that Magaret Laurence wanted his readers to make fun of Hagar. These people are frustrated and anxious, and all we do is laugh. I do not think that has done justice to Hagar and others in his situation.
