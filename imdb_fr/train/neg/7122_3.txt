"Screaming Skull" begins with a warning and offer of free funeral services if you die while watching - Now there is a hook! The story itself contains a rather interesting principle for a horror movie: an accomplice husband marries a rich woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with sharp noises, blows mysterious and skulls that come at inconvenient times. Add to the formula a sufficiently frightening gardener who always keeps the memory of the first wife of this man to whom he was devoted. Perhaps it's just that the 1950s did not have the technology to make some of the scary scenes needed to make this film; the techniques used here seem artificial and banal. But again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" when he was nine, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way that this movie did for kids viewers of the same era. <br /> Make no mistake, the movie is not terrible, it just seems to get boring sometimes. But the Whitlock House, usually huge but unfurnished, has a great atmospheric tension. The gardens and the pool bring a nice touch. For me, the most successful scene is when Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) becomes manic in the pond trying to recover the hidden skull. He sneaks straight into clothes and all this, in stark contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol role). One wonders who really was the moron. <br /> <br /> The film was the most shocking film: how about this beautiful roadster that the Whitlocks make their first appearance - sliding glass doors 1958! That at least blew me off my seat!
