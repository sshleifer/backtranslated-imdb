This show is amazing in this. . . what it represents and what it focuses on and. . . the words can not describe how crazy ET is. They will bring back anything. If a celebrity is even indirectly connected to the story, AND will report back. If a dog poop in Tom Cruise's yard, they'll report it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks and the public will envy this celebrity. If a celebrity is on trial. . . AND will report it for MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this show will report and no amount of time dictating how long they will focus on a story. Is it even considered legitimate? The reports are so annoying as well, with disjointed voices and ending with a useless pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without questioning the existence of humanity. AND is one of the main reasons why I avoid pre-evening shows in general. I regret that IMDb can only allow a minimum of one star and not zero or even in the negatives. For this show, earn -10 stars.
