It was perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over, neither of us understood the plot. Aside from the lack of intrigue, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only factor that buys the film is that it's so amazing that it's pretty funny. You can not help but laugh at a zombie that's crushed while the actors are throwing up a crappy dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but a group of friends can get together and laugh. It's now a common joke between my friends and me. 1 out of 10
