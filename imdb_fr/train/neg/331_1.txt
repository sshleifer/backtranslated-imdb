I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst film I've ever seen, and yes, I saw Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination in the role of Schecky Moskowitz, an aspiring humorist working on a cruise liner. This is the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place, like a crazy breakfast, and not like a naked gun, but rather frustrating, 'throw both shoes in the manner of TV.' Even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason that I can understand (it certainly was not for humor). Add to that Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something that I will not call the worst movie of all time because going to the sea does not even fit the definition basic of a movie. I highly recommend seeing this movie because it will enhance the reputation of every bad movie you will ever see. I guarantee you that the first thing you say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least it was not as bad as Going Overboard".
