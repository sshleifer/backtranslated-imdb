I wanted to vote zero or less. I loved the comment. It's the worst film of all time and "unbearable" is the perfect word, unless there is something worse than Roget ever imagined. I am also unable to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best we can say is that it is consistent.
