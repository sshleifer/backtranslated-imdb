It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to a cop, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop that. <br /> <br /> A B-action movie that borrows other movies and is pretty good with a good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three beautiful stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid B-Action movies, it's not for you.
