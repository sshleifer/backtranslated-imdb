It must be, by far, the absolute worst film I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in the film, I thought that this film could not be so serious since he had already shot in rather decent films and was a fairly good actor. FALSE! Nobody should waste time on this movie. I made a quick advance on 80% and I do not think I forgot anything.
