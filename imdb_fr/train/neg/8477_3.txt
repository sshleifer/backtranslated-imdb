Personally, I hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped and the idea was a scam of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is an arrogant girl who is sent to a place where she does not belong. The whole place hates her, and to make matters worse, there's a sexy guy who apparently does not like him (well, all this damn school can not stand you). Surprisingly, she finds a way to fit in and make everyone love her more, and makes the guy fall head over heels in love with her. Then comes the choice, where she has to choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey and then goes to the National Figure Skating Championships and is part of the Olympic team. No real surprises there. <br /> <br /> All this film was so predictable that you knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so horrible that I nearly vomited, and by the time I finished watching it, I had a headache and felt like shooting myself in the head for watching such bullshit. Do not look at this unless you are under ten or you really do not like shit movies.
