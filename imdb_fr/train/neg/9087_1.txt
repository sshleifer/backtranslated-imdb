Canadians are too polite to let go, but the Toronto Festival audience has left the theater mumbling that it will award the score 0 or 1 to this film on its voting sheet. The principle is that a modern filmmaker interprets a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses taking place in the distant past, when the druids were the spiritual leaders. Working at three eras offers many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including ridiculous and impractical clothing and special spiritual rites that involve very bad poetry. The lovers are divided by jealousy and their strict adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which develop situations of travesty and miscellaneous jokes. The film could have been hilarious as a piece of Monty Python, to which it looks too much, but Rohmer's effort falls flat. Spectators laughed at the jokes but lamented the slow pace. The end is rushing and is really awful. It's a trivial film and a waste of time for your film.
