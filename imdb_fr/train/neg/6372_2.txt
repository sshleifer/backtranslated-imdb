Do not bother yourself. A bit of prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those episodes of bumper cars ... the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again, until we do not gratify our heads and ask ourselves if There had never been a plot. Gina Phillips is good, but it's hard to play Dunaway, mystified, Lady Macbeth lost in the Duck Soup of the brother of Marx. Ah, the raven ... now there is an actor. And there is the parent who lies and lies down and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread who is filled with a lot of sadness and no work remedies. I am one of those suckers who have to watch a movie until the end. The raven says, "Never again."
