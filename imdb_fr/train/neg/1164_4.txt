I do not know where to start, so I'll start with an excerpt from the cover of this film. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's cube with Kitamura's own Versus." I have not seen Versus, so I can not talk about it, but I think Cube was an excellent movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone clearly confused "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I'll just go ahead and mess up the whole plot, because besides being a Swiss cheese sacred to a plot, it's also moldy cheese, and the film is not worth worth spending time, even if you do not know the plot in advance, so it does not matter. If I misunderstood the plot, do not hit me - it's probably because I had to fight to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> The US Army in Nevada has one day lost a UFO in the Nambi Desert. That makes sense, because they are both deserts, they are almost in the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey burst into the UFO and acquired an alien that was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. It does not matter. The extraterrestrial thing is now passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty enough" to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so she decides to move it from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another guy. But instead of simply choosing a member of the army, which is full of bloodthirsty people AND already on the side of the army, they decide that it is probably a good idea to choose a criminal on the death row. . Oh, and the reason they choose this criminal on death row is because he was the first person in history not to die from the non-lethal electric shock that is the method of execution standard, because everyone dies from the placebo effect when electrocuted. . I do not know if they do it so they can laugh in the teachers' room at the death of everyone, even if it is not deadly, or if they just want to reduce the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then, the film turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame, and unnecessary fights bore us to tears for an hour. And oh, wait, now they remember that they already had a guy who was infected with an alien, so the whole movie so far was actually a waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I did not want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a guy was nailed to the wall by a pipe in his chest, and he hangs out there -high and another guy goes on. The guy on the wall said, "I'm hurting, shoot me." And the living guy looks at him, and it's not like he's a naughty guy or anything, so he really looks sad and does not want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical break.) <br /> <br /> In the belly. "Gee THANKS A FREAKIN 'HEAP."
