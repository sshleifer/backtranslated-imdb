1999 will go down in history as the year when the film critic misleads the general public. They first sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they staged THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it about? Who the hell knows. Its full of complacency and bad game. I always like to stay and watch the credits, but when all that was over, I could not go out of the cinema fast enough. Most of the spectators who attended the screening I attended felt about the same. The dates were disputed between themselves and with the foreigners. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
