I do not know about this director, Sam Mraovich, who ruined just about every little aspect of this film. I would normally say it's a movie that should not exist, but this movie is perhaps the most important movie of all time. This film should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt "the worst film ever made". I've seen bad movies in my life, but that kind of breaks what I thought was bad in something much more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is hilarious, but the funny thing is that Mraovich himself considers it a good movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
