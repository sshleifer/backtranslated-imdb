If you are going to see this movie, you will want some theater, director, producer, actors and the person who told you to go see it! You should be ashamed, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face in front of this poor movie excuse. It could have been more frightening if the Japanese actors had just spoken in Japanese instead of trying to act in English. I wanted to be ashamed when the film ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on television and the movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really did not need to do anything to make this movie ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste your time and money on this movie.
