There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a parody. Sometimes I felt like watching a Kung Pow sequel rather than a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has everything to do with "Game of Death". On the contrary, it's more of a sequel / remake of "Enter the Dragon", incorporating many elements of this film - especially the real pictures. Bruce Lee's character, Billy Lo (apparently), investigates the sudden death of his friend and meets a film that was left to the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it is up to his lost brother to avenge the death of the two men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long plays the role of brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the kind of charisma to wear the film. His fighting abilities are however very good. It is obvious that Bruce Lee presents himself through sequences (no more) deleted just to enjoy the inheritance. That said, overall, the footage is actually better mounted than in "Game of Death", but that does not prevent the film from becoming a mess. <br /> <br /> Okay, the fighting is going well. very entertaining (I dare to say amazing) and make the film at least viewable. But there are so many stupid elements in this movie that it really puts your patience to the test. First, there is the supposed villain who lives in his palace ... or is it a mental institution? Seriously, the madman eats raw game, drinks stag blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and has peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look hard and smart just makes you feel sorry for him - you almost expect someone to take him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked bitch and a lion costume happened, I turned it off. However, I finished the film and I was rather happy to have done it because the fight scene towards the end (a bit like 'GOD') was the main reason to watch. Although the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final is disappointing if the premise was the order. We were told that the "tower of death" was an upside down and underground pagoda. That sounded good, as a modification of Bruce Lee's original idea with different fighting styles at each level. Could it be the "game of death" initially planned? No! The film should have been called "Generator Room of Death" because it is as far as the tower disappears. Of course, there were one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts clad in foil, a leopard-skinned henchman and a stupid monk. It's like Enter the Dragon was never made, the plot is a poor imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look once for fast fighting scenes, but so stupid sometimes it hurts. If that was planned, then everything is fine. Bravo, however, to recreate this projector room scene from "Enter The Dragon".
