Hip. Erotic. Wickedly sexy ... whatever. It's "The Terminator" with the werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The policeman saves the girl (the waitress!) From the big monster and introduces himself as his "protector". The lead actor Ryan Alosio imitates Kyle Reese very well ... There is a massacre in a police compound ... the villain is muscular with red eyes ... and even contains a dialogue in the sense of "Tu you said it's yourself, it'll never stop, never. "The screenplay is written by a novice screenwriter who, thank God, has not sold anything since then, and everything was put together by the famous bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a striped bar (always a good sign), and a biker with a nasty look burst out for no apparent reason, pursued by three cops. One of them is black and (horror shock!), It is he who is killed in the first five minutes. The film takes place for about an hour, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before ending up with an abyssal ending. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, actors come in the form of competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director willing to settle for less. If nothing else, they seem to learn to play in this film and Alosio, as well as some other actors, shows signs of talent. DarkWolf, in its human form, is played by the gargantuan Kane Hodder, famous for his many performances of Jason Vorhees in the films of Friday the 13th. He is decent enough, especially since he is not used to speaking. <br /> <br /> It's become famous, among the groups of boys in heat, for the lesbian scene on the roof between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who releases his kit several times in the great tradition of the old actresses' Power Rangers'. And it's undeniably obvious that the publisher has spent a LOT of time on this stage ... Anyway, the main redeeming feature is that the physical effects of the werewolf are pretty good and the wolf's design is not bad at all.But the CGI is bad. Simply bad. I mean seriously, if you can not reach a certain level of realism - why bother? Just throw some money into the makeup! Aside from the terrible scenario, this film has its moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. It's good to laugh if you have nothing better to do, but do not spend money on it. Please.
