I can not say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as the current assessments do here). I rented it about two years ago and I totally missed it. I even / tried / love it by looking at it twice, but I just could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time again and again. And I'm not one to screw up a movie, but I really think it was awful. It was not even funny. The only things I liked were the few scenes with Christopher Walken. I think this film ruined Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think about when I see one of their movies today is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is really very annoying too. <br /> <br /> Overall, well, I think you understand my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
