I just watched this movie today and not only it's terrible, but it seems that the director has just gathered a few friends to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie looks like a porn video with a crisp and clear view. <br /> <br /> Thank god, I work in a video store and I do not have to pay for it, because this movie is shit x infinity..Do not buy or rent this movie !!!! ! You'd have a better time watching Dude where's my car than that piece of shit! And it does not say much for this film either. <br /> <br /> The acting is ugly and the film is simply unassailable. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I came home and I vomited after watching this film of earth, then I took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had half of my mind, I would take the film outside and burn it too because no one should be subjected to it ... well maybe some members Al Queda ... especially those we have in custody as well as minor rapists sentenced to life imprisonment without parole ... just do a montage like a working clock Orange, then force those heads of cheese to watch over and over again.
