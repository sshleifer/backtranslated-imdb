Some here commented that it was the worst film ever made by Elvis. Well, they are only partially right. For me, it's the worst movie we've ever done! I have never seen anything so grossly cruel, insulting, vile, and against human nature as this film. A real embarrassment for the film industry, it's not so bad, it's good. There is no fun to camp around here like in other bad Elvis movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to pass through his painful. Pure garbage. Native Americans should continue here for their stereotypical treatment and poor clich√©. In fact, maybe ALL human beings should sue for the crime committed against the film and harm the whole thing, 0 Stars, seriously. Grade: F
