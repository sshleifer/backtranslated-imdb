I saw a lot of movies and I would rarely qualify a movie "1", but this movie was more than terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I watch horror movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in the house / forest / school / etc. then shout "hello is there anyone?" - but at least they are credible when they do it .. This movie could not even get that right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other horror B movies like Venom and The Fog look like award-winning masterpieces at academies. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind watching movies and I can only say that this film was a total waste of time and I write this comment so that whoever thinks to watch this film will rethink . IT'S HORRIBLE!
