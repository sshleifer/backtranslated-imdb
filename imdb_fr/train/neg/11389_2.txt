If you like movies that walk with a little intrigue embellished with perverted sex, this movie is for you. On the positive side, the main actor / actress (the transsexual newcomer) has an interesting screen presence, but insufficient to give more than a rather interesting film, if any. This film mainly deals with three social marginalized (transsexual prostitute, prostitute and Russian gay immigrants) who have somehow developed a link. Why is not clear. We expect these unsuitable people to be the basis of honest people who have the ability to love while jostling their bodies on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her dad's sugar something ninety! The filmmaker shows a gritty and unpleasant side of life while wanting to make us believe that everything serious beneath him is really normal in that he has a three-way home that helps them all the way through. life. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a true look of life on the wild side. In summary, no conspiracy, no truth and no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless of course you just enjoy it!
