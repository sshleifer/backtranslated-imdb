What happened in the name of God here? How can one create what is practically an inexpensive imitation of Redneck Zombies? Has Zombie '90 ever been supposed to entertain someone ... or even make a profit in dollars? But mainly, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a whimsical named Andreas Schnaas, specializing in stunning movies like Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain blasphemies. in the titles. In the gore department, this one is not very different from the rest. Although the level of inefficiency ... well, upsetting. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as terrible as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive movie is bloody, think about it. <br /> <br /> Becoming too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and devour the living. Never has the concept been treated this way. The effects of gore are a whole, a new low. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can not say if, originally, it was supposed to be funny, one way or another, I doubt that the dubbing in English is very faithful to the script of origin, but strange things happened. All this makes me think of a video introduction to a Troma movie, except that it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I only saw one film worse than that, The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a current director, I would strongly recommend Nikos The Empaler If you think that nothing matches what you are looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence, but you've been warned . It takes nerves of steel to get there completely. But if gore is all you are looking for, you may be able to handle that. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but most importantly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Update 05/07/09: After a few more views of Zombie '90, I changed my heart or I guess I just understood it. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so too bad for hard words, though, Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
