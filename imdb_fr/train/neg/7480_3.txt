We all know what happens when we have a bad day in the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy describes the situation in which you live the worst of everyday life just to get to the office. Sometimes it's not worth going, do you know what I mean? And sometimes it's not worth doing something when it was done in 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> It's not that Steve Martin is ugly. comedian or bad for the role of harassed and stressed advertising performer; on the contrary, on both points. And, it is not that Goldie Hawn is also inept; her work has always been good, if not excellent, since I first saw her in Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the 1960s on television. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it's not about the unlucky couple. at all: it's really about New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their life away from marital happiness ?? kind of ?? in the largest city in the world. If you're New York ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explores everything that can go wrong on a trip, and that includes most situations and gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. Unfortunately, this version of 1999 takes only free slopes for an audience that, today, expects or wishes to see excesses. For example, we are not satisfied with the star attraction of the main actors: it is a cameo (relatively long also) Rudy Giuliani, then Mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Giuliani claim the president? Worst ?? a street advertisement for the kinder face of New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, who takes over his role of Basil Fawlty ?? but this time, like a prancing transvestite too ?? once again, the hotel staff is furious, seduced sycophanically by wealthy guests and is generally like the idiot he is in this role. And, at the same time, the memory of Fawlty Towers, which is undoubtedly the best British comedy series, is second to none ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film turned? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So when it was built in 1970, it was the city you saw: dark, dark, gloomy, unsettling and not the place the harried couple finally chose for their new life together in Big Smoke ( as then, polluted and all). . In 1999, things had improved: the glitz was back, New York was booming, it was the Big Apple, ready to be consumed, if you had the moxie ... <br /> <br /> > So, naturally, the couple in this second coming find this moxie in themselves and join the fabulous battle to pursue the American dream of life, freedom and the quest for happiness. So this film is really funny, but not for reasons that producers may have considered. Although I love Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this film is a parody of the much better movie made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you have seen this last point, then do not worry at all.
