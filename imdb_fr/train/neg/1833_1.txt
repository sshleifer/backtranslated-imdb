Please, someone prevents Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie. Write the studios, damn, even write your congressman. I had more laughs at a funeral than I watched ANY movie from Stiller. Jack Black is trying to do something about a comedy about the disappearance of dog poop, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, just looks embarrassed to be the. Stiller is a little funny, but now, even with someone who bails him out, proves he is overrated as a comedian. It's no wonder this film went bad and is available in dollar theaters after only a few weeks. I warn you and you must warn your friends, do not watch this movie, it's just horrible, worse than Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say that), worse plan 9, worse Ishtar, worse then the child Golden. Please, Hollywood, stop letting Ben Stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a dreadful actor, and he's bringing down the others with him. The following movie was rated 1 because there are no negative scores allowed. Therefore, even if the board says one, I give it a zero.
