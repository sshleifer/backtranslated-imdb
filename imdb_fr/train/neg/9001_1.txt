When I watch a movie, I realize it's "just a movie", but I still like to allow myself to be absorbed as much as possible under the circumstances. I think that's what makes us cry, scream, laugh or otherwise react emotionally as members of the public, even if, deep down, we know it's "just a movie". What I do not want is that the film reminds me that it's just a movie, so I can not slip into the above difficulties, regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film has chosen to frequently use multi-angle shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find it extremely distracting and downright irritating. They can also display a banner at the bottom of the screen saying `Caution: this is just a movie. Do not allow yourself to become too interested or absorbed. If I want a "picture in the picture", I will activate it from the remote control of my TV, but never during a movie, I want to enjoy it.
