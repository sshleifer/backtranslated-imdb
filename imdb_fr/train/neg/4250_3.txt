It's like other Dracula movies, Dracula's henchmen still on Dracula's side, which disappointed me in the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to stay vampire or not, I would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against his master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) whether it's just the priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising intrigues!).
