It's a beautiful deep cast, but for a thriller, you'd better give more than just naming actors and talking. The first third of this film was only speech, and still speech. Most of these activities were women who quarreled with each other. <br /> <br /> The top five actors listed here are women, which helps to verify that it's really a "girls movie" and a little more. This probably works on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a scene of fast murder and more discussion. Midway through, they had lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked to be around 15 years old here.
