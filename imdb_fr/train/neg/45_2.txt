While the number of videos that I had not seen yet decreases, this small pile of garbage appeared on my "to rent" list when I saw that it was available. <br /> <br /> The principle involves a dummy or something being kidnapped and taken to the jungle to be bought by a motley crew of idiots. Another gaffe is hired to bring her back and receives a bag of money which will be used for exchange, but if he returns with the girl with all the money, he will undergo a significant reduction. He brought a helicopter and a pilot with him and, wow, this pilot is one of the worst actors of all time! Surely, they are all terrible and dubbing will make you cry blood. After flying into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibalistic cult whose terrifying earth-bound god roams the woods, like a human Kong king in search of tribes to devastate and devour. Now, this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeups of all time, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's about it. His grunts and moans are a ubiquitous feature of the soundtrack, and I found myself cutting most of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this film was banned, although there is a specific scene, about a second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts, but it is not a redeeming factor for Gore fans. In addition, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long close-ups of female genitals and, unfortunately, men too. So, if you want a "fair" exploitation, you have understood it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this trash can to anyone. It's not even the bad movie. It's just an incredibly padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will likely see. Even then, if you go through the list, leave this task for the last time. If you look at it first, you may have the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
