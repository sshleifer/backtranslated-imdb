Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps dramatic or stupid or simple or comic, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I watched, it certainly did not look like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (even if the prologue tries to complicate it). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of killers. <br /> <br /> Subtract now the first (they never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the assassins, the princess, become a thug on a revenge trip. Add to that a rebellious love with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not managed to make a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some strange visuals that try to do science fiction with a small budget, you still have a feeling of emptiness. The film just does not look like a movie, but a strange, incoherent and boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
