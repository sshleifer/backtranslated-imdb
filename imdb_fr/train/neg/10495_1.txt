I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the courage to go even a yard of fang. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Foolish jokes, people being eaten, and the skit about the president make the film one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie you have to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the crocodile hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat it after seeing it.
