I will admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and has a mission to see all the movies she's gone to (unfortunately, that includes the awful Batman and Robin movies, The Avengers) and this one . <br /> <br /> this must be considered the worst movie I have ever seen. (yes, it ranks even lower than The Avengers). everyone seems lost and it is incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think that Uma is a goddess like me, please do not submit to this movie. you will hate the next morning for this.
