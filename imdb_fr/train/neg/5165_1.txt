I was looking forward to this trip and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I am very easily amused by the roller coasters and rides in amusement parks. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster part went well. - and that was about 30 seconds of a 90 second run. <br /> <br /> It was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> He was desperately trying to look like a mix of Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland's much better rides, and was failing in every way. <br /> <br /> It was neither exciting nor exciting in the least.
