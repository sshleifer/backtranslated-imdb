It was a DVD bought blind. This completely killed a good buzz when I started playing. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy at the head of a bubble, but it's uh. sordid. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters are doing things so lean, deranged and convenient that I found it disappointing to watch. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box is waiting for me to wait for something else, a captive and awkward caper film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination mean nothing.)
