I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment saying it was Sidney Poitier's best film. Poitier had just returned from a break of more than a decade in the cinema and he is clearly cracking. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and do not include this. Five of his films are on AFI's 100 Best Inspirational Films list, not to mention that. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker, went in search of a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border into Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film fail clearly and the link between Berenger and Poitier was foolish and awkward (not helped by a completely bland scenario). Kirstie Alley (as a host) was underutilized and almost entirely ignored while on screen. Some suspense attempts are made, for example when you are supposed to try to guess which of the 5 men participating in a fishing trip is the murderer (all are molded villains). I understand that this is the whole call for most fans. I guessed who it was and I was not really trying. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Berenger, watch the Sniper (1993), you will even have the chance to see Billy Zane strutting. It's much better. Overall, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring, and it's too easy for me.
