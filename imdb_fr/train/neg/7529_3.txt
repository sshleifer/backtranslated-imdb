Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is probably one of the worst films ever made. Bruce Lee died after falling from a helicopter after being hit on the back of the neck by a ninja knife, but that does not explain how he came to be in a helicopter since the previous scene approached him. but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. This becomes downright absurd from there, like an overpriced comic book. The idea may not be so rotten, but it does not happen with the slightest artistic talent from the filming point of view. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding plausible stories in his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90% of the martial arts scam movies made in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. "Game of Death II" is in the category of unwanted cinema in my opinion, despite the presence of Bruce Lee.
