I did not know anything about this movie until I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was an "epic battle scene from start to finish". It could not have been further from the truth. This is one of the most boring, poorly written, poorly realized and horribly played movies I've ever had the misfortune to put my eyes on. I would rank it up there with the movie that I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it is hard to believe that the filmmakers thought this shit at the cheese feuilleton would be taken seriously as a historical fact. It also contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells the girl, "You smell the moon." The girl answers "What does the moon smell?" OMG! You're joking! The scene where the guy was drawn and cut into quarters made the audience laugh as it seemed ridiculously cheap and the sound effects of the ripped guy reminded me that someone was making a sound of farting with their mouths. If this happens in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This film is so bad that I made the decision of about 45 minutes and I had to catch up ... and that's what I did. Terrible.
