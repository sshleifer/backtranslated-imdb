I saw "What is it?" at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Certainly, the name of the film was at least judicious, because I had the impression that even the scriptwriter / director could give no answer. During the Q & A session that followed the screening, Glover said the film was originally designed to be a short film intended to show the virtues of using actors with Down syndrome. However, this is not in itself sufficient reason to create a movie. The actors are, in my opinion, the building blocks of a broader vision - a broader vision that seemed confused at best and absent at worst. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to discuss taboo topics. Well, he does that. But why? The film seems to have no position, no reason to address anything. Does he believe that these things should not be taboo? The movie does not even give me an indicator of that. Taboo for taboo is not interesting. He can not even afford to make the taboo uncomfortable or inconvenient at any level because he has not paid attention to the public. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the problems with the concept for a moment, what shocked me the most was how badly the movie was built. Editing, cinematography and other technical aspects seemed to be extremely amateurish. Glover said the film cost between $ 125 and $ 150,000, and I think that money should have been spent for different designers (Glover actually made some drawings - I know I've at least seen the sound in the credits). The painted decorations are good (not great), but badly used. Some parts look like a photographed play - which would be nice if it was used for any purpose, but in Glover's hands, it just looks sloppy. Other parts are filmed as a kind of Home Movie, a quality inferior to many things I see for the first time for directors on iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" I can not even understand how seriously the film should be taken. Some parties have the impression that Glover is asking you to think seriously. At other times, he seems to have his own little joke. Maybe he wanted it to be ironic or meaningful, but I just felt that Glover could not even afford to pay serious attention to his movie. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film. If only it had been. After seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of images and ideas in the first twenty minutes. It is arguable to think that ideas have been formulated enough to claim that they were there for that period.
