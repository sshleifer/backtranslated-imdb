At first glance, this movie has everything a psychopath wants: a vampire story with a restriction for "under 18", filled with hyper violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), fanatical fanatics and even a necrophilic gay cop! But then, this film is a succession of bad stories (so thin), bad actions - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you think you're looking at a bad Monty Python -, a bad music (80's hard rock), l video recording is awful. , the end is really a shame ... Plus the sex scenes are ridiculous, the gore not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in a mirror and do not even fear the day! You will be very disappointed unless you see it as a "space mutiny" or a "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the last third, because that's its real place. <br /> <br /> I would say that it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
