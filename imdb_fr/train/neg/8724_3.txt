OK - the disadvantages first: the obligatory alligator of the 70s (correct, correction - caiman) with motionless limbs is aggravated by miniature scale underwater shots (with the total length of the reptile compared at the size of the boat) using a toy alligator to be whirled around the toy boat in a largely illuminated water - even for the night shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive films - killers - exploiters - Westerners, superstitious natives will fight **** and begin to slaughter holidaymakers seem unjustified this time. No one has really abused the natives - exploited, of course, but far from abusive treatment. After all, this is one of the natives (canoodling with a spoiled top model during a taboo full moon) who drew the curse of the Demon River on them, right? <br /> <br /> Holidaymakers are easily bored (with the exception of the symbolic old girl / slightly blasphemous-girl-who-takes-a-shine-at-hero-that you often see in Euroflicks of the 70s) but far from deserving of a violent death - unless they are your next neighbor door, notice. A couple is killed when it is heroic, which is remarkable in that none of them fulfills the role of teammate. There are only two bad guys in the movie, so the deaths are more arbitrary than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The sequence where the giant caiman cracks and escapes thirty tourists in less than five minutes will seem very involuntary. hilarious. <br /> <br /> The moment the natives decide not to wipe out the surviving Westerners and say to them practically "hey, you're not so bad after all, sorry for last night's racket" - because that they blew up the monster lizard - you shake your head while the old music sounds. You know, the local military dictatorship will annihilate the village for trade with tourism after the credits ... <br /> <The advantages: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know WHY this movie interests you first, right? I thought so. If you are a Bach completist, have the NoShame films DVD reissued earlier this year (remastered numerically, with no real bonus, except for the director who deplores the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half-naughty, he is far from being an idiot (always an advantage in the B-series movies) and the cynical little child provides the bulk of comic relief. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit, but get it cheaper!
