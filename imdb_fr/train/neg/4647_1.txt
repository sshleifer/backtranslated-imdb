Half of the reviews were good so I took a chance for $ 10. Of course, Priscilla Barnes had talked about sex, but it was not much. The later plot that she could be the other mother actress and the documentary creak for the young woman stretches it. It's not funny, it's not so hot that it's not a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry and this is not based on anything that happened in the industry. That could have shocked with what is popular today in adult movies mocking today's videos and that big orgy they had 5 minutes to turn a joke like a bigger joke that was made several decades ago in the early 1970s.
