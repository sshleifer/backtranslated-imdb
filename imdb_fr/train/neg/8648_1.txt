Well, basically, the movie is blowing! It's Blair Witch and Sean Penn's ill-conceived fantasy of traveling to Iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" really is. The script appears to have been written by a Grade 8 student (no offense against Grade 8 students); the two main actors play the film in full; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (I did not know anything about it - but it just did not look like real documentaries I watched), and worse Christian Johnson took a good idea and had him sucked. It reminded me of the time when I was trying to draw my dog ​​and I ended up with a very bad stick-like character that looked more like a giant dung. I'd rather watch Blair Witch VIII than sit on it.
