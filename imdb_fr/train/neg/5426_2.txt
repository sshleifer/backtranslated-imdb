`In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try "a brazen swindle not only of these two films, but also of" The Evil Dead "and" The Shining ". That said, they do not really do bad horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame because it's a gas. <br /> <br /> Rainbow Harvest is Winona's substitute here, and even though she's barely more than whispering her aftershocks (and shouting from time to time: "YOU ARE LEAVING !!!" in her haunted mirror) she is very gothic before being fashionable, so you must respect her. (And she's pretty creative about that too, accessorizing black leather scarves and a kind of black hawaiian-punch-guy black paint spray.) Eat your heart, dear.) <br /> Karen Black suract a little, but it is not totally without dignity, and you can not help but sympathize with it. (Unless you're a certain friend of mine, who asked: "Who is it, Horse Lips from" MASH "?" The first time she appeared on the screen.) <br /> < There are good performances of support from Kristin Dattilo (as a square chick who befriends Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his role as well-known piece), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (somehow, a funeral director or whatever). But it's sad to see Yvonne DeCarlo, once smoky, reduced to playing what we can only think of the role of Charlotte Rae. <br /> <br /> The eighties were the pinnacle of hilarious and stupid horror movies like this, and "Mirror, Mirror" was one of the last of its kind. It's really worth a look.
