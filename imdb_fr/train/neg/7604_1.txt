Of course, this is happening in the west, but the title suggests that it is a conventional western. Instead, it's a movie of a sheriff's wife. Make no mistake, it's a bad movie about a sheriff's wife. She becomes sheriff when her husband is shot. she is only a little upset by this. Her main goal is to sue the villain who is also a woman, but the bad guy hires a guy to kill her. This is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, as any new sheriff wants, whoever killed in this movie. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because she liked him, she would not do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons that are also rather stupid. This movie is very boring and not worth to be seen ... it's not one of the best episodes of MST3000 they've made. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because it would make it even more painful. Corman is a low-budget manager, but even he should know better than letting people in and out of one place.
