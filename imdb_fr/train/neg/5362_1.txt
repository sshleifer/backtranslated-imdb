A woman with a wig that "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (= takes the wig) probably does not see what the audience can see from afar: <br /> <br /> *** start alert spoiler * ** that her husband has an affair with his best friend and they are both trying to get rid of him. *** end of the spoiler alert *** <br /> <br /> And what spoiler it was: the title already gives it, is not it? Bad acting, bad scenario: waste of time Oh yes: in the end, she will live happy forever .... <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, you will really love "Women Cannibals with Jungle Lawyer of Death "....
