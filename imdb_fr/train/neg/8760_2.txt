This film concerns allegedly un-established types (aesthetically and sexually) that seemingly can not withstand basic romantic needs. While great players like Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon are involved, they are based on a childish scenario that is based almost entirely on intelligent dialogue. who is not. The role of Nixon has the best lines, but it often rings them too quickly, a timing problem that needs to be corrected by the director. The grotesque climax uses all the clich√©s available, whether spent or not, and thus ends this dull comedy attempt.
