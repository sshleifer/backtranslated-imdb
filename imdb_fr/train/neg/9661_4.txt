I mean that playing is bad, but I think it was the staging that made it. I never thought much about Highlander (same director), but this one could be attributed to the 80s. <br /> <br /> This one however has no excuse. People get shot when leaving the trenches with a man in front of him! This type of error, coupled with a fuzzy timeline, strange combat tactics, sub-equal cuts and poor visual effects make it a sub-equal movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Then, as so many others have commented, all this American bullshit. The German general is almost afraid of his captured American soldier. Prepare to swallow a lot, although in small doses. <br /> <br /> In summary, this war movie is not horrible but remains quite normal in all its aspects.
