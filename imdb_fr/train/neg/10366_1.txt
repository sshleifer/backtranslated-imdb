It was more than 80 minutes of semi-unexpected boredom. First, I wondered how it was possible to produce something like this. Then, reaching the 70th minute, I thought it was only a few more minutes and I continued to the end, which I'm a little proud, because I consider this film as an excellent test for the patience and tolerance to shit. Was it worth watching? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you are willing enough, you may even last until the end ... The film lacks consistency and the characters do not seem to have common sense. all. All that happens in the movie, you can be sure to have seen something before, and they seem to have been put in this movie just to fill the movie reel.
