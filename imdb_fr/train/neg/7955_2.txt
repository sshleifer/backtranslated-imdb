Carrie Fisher has repeatedly stated that she made this film at a time when she had a serious cocaine problem, and she does not remember much about it. That would explain why she made this film, but not why the other members of the casting or the team did it; I can not believe that EVERYONE has had a coke problem. It must be one of the worst absolute movies ever made, and that says a lot. The "director" Tim Kincaid or "the writer" Buddy Giovinazzo can not be held responsible, because it is obvious that this image was neither written nor realized by anybody. Apparently, everything is spontaneously close, because there is little evidence of coherence, coherence, design, intrigue, meaning, intelligence or anything else. What is really amazing is that some professionals have been involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both veterans of the industry, with Marks also a director and not bad. Why they got involved in this pile of smoking offal exceeds the understanding. Tim Kincaid, the presumed "director", has made quite a few sci-fi and horror movies at moderate rent and, having watched most of them, I can tell you that none of these films is good. This, however, is by far the worst thing he has ever done and is a major accomplishment on his part. All, absolutely ALL, of this movie is in the 12th rank - at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 of outer space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is banal, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time even looking at the video box lid, let alone praising it. A complete failure, complete, boring.
