Nowhere near the original. It's a pretty precise copy that does not bring anything new to the story. But the staging is very poor. Basinger is weak - without a good staging. Baldwin is simply a second league compared to McQueen. I looked at it just out of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I had what I thought. Almost a B-movie with actors and second-rate directors. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a homage and it lacks actually very good actor of his time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of a beautiful photo. This is a total loss of time. Save 2 hours or watch the original (again :))
