I'm a fan of the series and I read the 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should look at this are the ones who have already read the series and are curious about it. It's very bad, and you will not read them anymore. Not to be mean, but Lucy is so ugly that it hurts the movie. Was she the director's daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers of the movie were jealous of his teeth. She had an overbite that would shame a beaver. The film loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR or even Harry Potter books. <br /> <br /> One thing they did well! Aslan! Very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) looked ridiculous, Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around. (I guess it's like that old horse on horseback, two people inside?) Also, I'd like to know what the kids think about this movie. Maybe they would like that? But as for adults, it's a safe bet that they will not, even if they are fans of CS.
