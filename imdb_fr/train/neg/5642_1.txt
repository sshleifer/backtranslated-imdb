This title is more like a shooting exercise than a movie that should have been shown for public viewing. For Dafoe and his wife, it must have been fun to work together in a film for the first time, without taking into account the fact that people could actually watch it. I felt like it was 90 minutes lost while I was anxiously waiting for a plot to develop, or even begin. or ending. I have already seen 'arty' films and that does not look like an abstract or original artistic work, it seems to me quite useless. <br /> <br /> the only people to give the score 10 to this film are the under 18s. No doubt for the useless erotic scenes that the film insisted on launching us. That's if you can call it erotic. It certainly did not have any taste.
