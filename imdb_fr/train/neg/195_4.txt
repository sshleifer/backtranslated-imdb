Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Examining his flaws, it is still an interesting account of Alamo's famous and heroic siege during Texas's struggle for Mexico's independence. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This television project also features David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
