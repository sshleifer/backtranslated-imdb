Yes, in 35 years of cinema, I finally saw the stench that surpasses all the other horrible movies I've seen. Beat 'Fuck Me' and 'Flirt' to chase 'good will' for extreme horror. It's a pretentious blige of the highest order ... not even a pretentious hold. The effects are cheap and are worse - useless. <br /> <br /> The scenario seems to have been written by a first year film student who does not go out very much but wants to sound full of omen! The acting game is simply unbearably bad - Tilda Swinton ends a career filled with empty woods with a performance that varies neurotically between "intensity" comoteuse and laughable. Apparently, an idiot allowed the director of this film to make another ... be warned
