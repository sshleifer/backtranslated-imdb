Ascension is actually an advance over what the original movie was in the story and in the special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember, he was taken from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny like Luke, the kid who help the woman he is in love with a body away from Dracula steal from the slab. Diane Neal is good as a woman stealing Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boyfriend. And Stephen Billington is as great as Dracula. Give a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original movie. Roy Scheider completes the rest of the cast in this film and does a decent job as a mentor to Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they are gone. It is difficult to know if the last film will close the series on a good note.
