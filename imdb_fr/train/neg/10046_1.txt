Dante's first season in "Homecoming" did not really impress me. It was not really a horror story, but rather an intelligent political statement with the undead. The situation of Screwfly is the story of a virus that is unleashed on the world and that replaces the sexual drive of men by deadly tendencies towards women. The episode begins well with a short film explaining how the fly was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man is arrested when women's bodies are found at his home. I suppose this is supposed to show the beginning of the epidemic, but it is not clear because it is never revisited. The episode lasts a moment, it presents the characters blah blah blah. It seems cool and mysterious, but the episode has a tendency to worsen as it progresses to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
