There is so little in Anne Rice's fantastic book that what IS here is meaningless. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - do not reach the screen at all, and those who do it are weakened to the point that there is no longer any reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the connection between Marcel and Juliette? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Mary, whose greatest attribute (and disadvantage) is that she can pass for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end when Marcel is beaten by his father? We do not learn anything about Aglae, except that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no background explaining this hate? <br /> <br /> As far as performance is concerned, there is no better performance than mediocre, although this is probably due to the deplorable scenario. The best of the lot is that of the actor playing Richard - but Richard is not enough on the screen to save the film. The worst is Jasmine Guy in the role of Dolly Rose, but again, that is to say that the actress has nothing to do with the little work she has worked with. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just terrible. I thought it would be impossible for a film shot by Anne Rice to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS gives this mess a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a bitch that it allows his best works to become such a junk on the screen?
