So, do not even think about praising this in stores, because it's a pretty bad movie. You could think that JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rat is thrown into the toilet and has to sort of go out. Fans of the terrible "Shrek" could enjoy it, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" will probably turn away with disgust. Also, why did not they do it in modeling clay or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For a movie AARDMAN ?? !! Obviously, Aardman stayed quietly while they let Dreamworks take care of everything. False, false, FALSE !!! Almost all the characters are awful, aside from that freaky frog guy, which is perfect for a movie villain. But the rest of the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek".
