Ah WINTER KILLS, based on Richard Condon's novel about a plot that killed the President of the United States 20 years ago. I knew Condon had also written THE CANDIDATE MANCHURIEN, which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller. <br /> <br /> The winter killings left me cold. It's not a thriller - it's worthless shit, maybe the worst movie I've seen this month and, boy, I saw a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the scenario. Since William Richert was responsible for both, he should be blamed for this baseless farce. <br /> <br /> There are two problems with this movie. First of all, it's the way everything is presented in a totally exaggerated way. It's not as good as saying something like this James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everyone has a wacky side, with actors completely attacking their performances. This could have been justified if there was entertainment value for the film but there is none. As a satire, it's very silly, so stupid that it becomes almost unassailable. Secondly, the scenes seem to have been cut to the point of becoming senseless. Take, for example, a scene where the hero confronts a fiery militia leader called Dawson. Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds to start, and then the hero is on the plane. The scenes begin and end without rhyme or reason <br /> <br /> A terrible film that is a test not to be missed
