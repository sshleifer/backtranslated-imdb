I will be brief and precise. This film was an insult to anyone with an IQ at room temperature. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They can forget the draft or be in combat too. It's not going to happen. You see, hard to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that we are in 2007, the reality can not change things so that people do not make themselves feel. Men can not give or breastfeed their babies (Oh-I forgot San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in combat situations or other physical difficulties. How many women play in the NFL or the NHL? Finally, I could not make fun of me in hell if what I just wrote bother you. Come to think about it - if it annoys you, it only warms my heart. I did not write something that was not true. This foolish movie is nothing more than a comedy and ugly to that.
