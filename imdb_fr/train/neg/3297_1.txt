Why take a show that millions of us have watched and loved in their childhood and make a complete joke? They ask why Hollywood did not win as much as before. Because they throw garbage and pay huge sums to the actors to be garbage collectors and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was: good people in difficult situations, where the good boys of the Ill win. It did not go with the wind but it was fun. This movie is a trash! Hollywood can not offer anything original, so they take something good and ruin it for $$$$. I only hope that this film is 10x less than what it cost to do. The only ones to have fun with this shit are those who drove General Lee. The public is the victim. <br /> <br /> Do not see it, look instead at the rebroadcasts of the TV show. They still resist 20 years later.
