If you want to watch a strangely-turned, strangely-lit film, strange stories of those men (and a woman) who love to piss off, if you want to enjoy a story that's going nowhere between these two guys, a boxer and the other a gay man, so you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I felt as badly bruised and cut as the director himself (of the movie) beat me. <br /> <br /> This is a film where you are not made to watch the plot or the acting, it is a film to admire in horror and wonder. A bit like watching a plane crash or train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even a mediocre film, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> A warning to all who watch this movie: do not eat in advance. You may want to throw up by the end of the movie.
