Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a psychiatric facility (even though she has killed six people) and delivered to the Hope Bartholomew Transition House. Once there, she immediately regains her criminal behavior and kills all who are between her and her food. <br /> <br /> SAINT MOLY! Is this movie sucks! You know that you have problems when the credits begin and that it is only the credits of the first film, apparently filmed on a television screen. Nick Millard (under his nickname Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel more than ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into video. Seriously, I made movies at home with more production value than that. And Millard is attempting to shoot a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 movie by doubling half of the display time with footage from the first movie (which seems to have been removed from a used VHS copy). Alden is good as Ethel again but the movie is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for playing in this trash. I mean, at least the first movie has tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if that's possible), bumpy camera work, horrible sound and editing that seems to have been done with two connected VCRs. Avoid that at all costs!
