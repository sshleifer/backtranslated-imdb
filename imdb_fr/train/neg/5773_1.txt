Another FINE effort by America's most underrated filmmaker. His knowledge of racism is amazing and impresses me on more than one level. The accusations that Lee is actually just a sneaky racist, a poisoned dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood's Affirmative Action system to make inferior films is a total NONSENSE, a mere propaganda of far right. The very notion that Lee resorts to abusing the current climate of politically correct America to produce hateful anti-white films is simply FALSE and malevolent. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's critics even go so far This suggests that GOTB glorifies African Americans while belittling other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD broadcast by people AGAINST peaceful coexistence between different races in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the movie is a long dialogue between the rich black Republican and the others on the bus. The opinions presented by this man are simply FALSE - in all areas. 100% UNTRUE. It lacks education, unlike brightly trained guys who REALLY throw it off the bus. <br /> <br /> Terrible performances and an INTELLIGENT scenario make it possible to live an audiovisual experience that rarely rivals all the political films made since then. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out the incessant lie that the Million-Man March had only 80,000 people taking part! <br /> <br /> (And now, all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what message does Lee send? he here? If someone does not accept your political opinions, you simply apply the violence and throw it down the bus. I thought the movie was saying "get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr.Lee is after all for bus segregation, that is to say he is no different from those who are crazy about KKK before him: the bus is only for blacks who adhere to the line of thought of the Democratic Party. So much for "free slaves" ... <br /> <br /> The closing credits: "This film was entirely financed by blacks." And distributed and marketed by a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and Whites that Farrakhan despises ...
