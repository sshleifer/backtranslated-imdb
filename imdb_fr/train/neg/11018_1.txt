I bought this video at a great price, excluding rental, because I thought the cover was very pretty. And it was good, but the movie is a trash. I can handle a grade B, sometimes even a good B (for example, "Surf Nazis Must Die" is a classic example of how the genre can be entertaining), but it was just bland. Incredibly boring scenes were broken into pieces by good cheap pornography and entertaining dream horror sequences. This film has very little to offer.
