First viewed 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): A disappointing musical from the point of view of character development, in my opinion, of this much vaunted work by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are some good songs and a decent comic representation, sometimes, of Yul Brynner's King of Siam - but the film does not really do a good job of presenting the situation and backgrounds. I can only blame the scenario and perhaps even some of the actors for why we do not understand the situation of the character and his situations. I know it may be a little too much to ask a musical for the pleasure of songs and dance, but even this part did not really mark me. The basic storyline is the story of an English woman who came to Siam to teach children about high-end European things. We discover later that the king is actually the greatest pupil. There is a forbidden side of romance between the king's new wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latino as an Arab - go for it !!) and a former lover who causes some complications but nothing really hypnotizing has been added. Deborah Kerr, as main character Annie, is OK but not convincing either. The king learns certain things because of his presence and the film fades as he does. It's really a tiny story with some songs and dancing, but it's not really an experience for a spectator.
