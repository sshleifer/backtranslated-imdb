I was an avid spectator until I personally spent long cold hours helping to build a house for the white family, only to be disgusted to see her a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscapes were removed, the magnificent rocky sidewalk and the front fountain were removed, all the pines and pecan trees in the front were cut off, the sprinkler system was ripped off. It now looks like a disaster area. They do not even live there anymore ... they live "in town" and only go out on weekends. It makes me sick to think of all the hours given by the great people of Oklahoma and see the result. The story we all saw on television was not completely the truth ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
