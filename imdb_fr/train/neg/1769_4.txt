1st watched 04/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King's vampire-like movie has so many weird and wacky elements that you start laughing at the extreme strangeness of half the world. movie and you wonder if this movie could have a cult for King fans. It is the story of a mother and her son who are somnambulists (a cat-like feline, eating flesh, in need of life, almost a race of humanoid) moving from town to town. city ​​looking for virgins to feed. They look like pretty people in the upper class, except they are secret lovers and cats hang out of their houses day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their yard to try to contain the population. We see them breaking their necks when they attack (which is also a first in my cinematic experience) - hope that no real cat was hurt in the making of the film. The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush until he turns into a "sleepwalker" and then he just wants his body. This film is so unique in his film that it might have been better if it was a complete satirical comedy about life in the suburbs, but the director tries to scare you every two minutes until you want to overcome it and bring out the gore. Eventually, this happens and the movie ends at the typical end of Stephen King. The film is interesting because King's humor is more present than usual, but his strangeness is also very present and what you have is a film that his fans will probably love and should have in their collection, but as that film worthy of interest, it really does not cut it.
