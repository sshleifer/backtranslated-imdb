When a film is independent and not rated, like that of the Hamiltons, I expected to get out of the norm, to cut you the violence in the heart. I know that good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, visited the website and even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this horrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawson Creek with incestuous shades. My expectations were extremely low for this film, but the small expectations for the film were shot as soon as I saw that an hour had elapsed before we saw the first drop of blood coming out. from someone. There were too many holes in the plot and left too much imagination. I regret not having seen Happy Feet. I think there may have been more violence and coolness in this film than in The Hamiltons!
