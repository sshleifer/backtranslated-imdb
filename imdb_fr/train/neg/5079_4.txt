What a great actor to have in such a terrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production are however quite good, even if they take place in London but with exteriors in Bristol. No matter ?? to see a cathedral, you have seen them all, in a way. <br /> <br /> The story, however ... is about a man born with the power to cause death and destruction to anyone and anything, if that was the wish. Referring simply to the real cases of telekinesis, the narrative constructs the image of a man misused and misjudged both as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; so much so that he demands revenge at will, literally. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is headed in the wrong direction and therefore begins to destroy the lot. Just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The problem, however, is that the narrative attempts to mix authentic scientific data on strange mental powers and merge them with a quasi-religious trap to produce a hodgepodge. theory on all this. Mixing facts and fantasy in this way rarely works ?? and I am afraid that Richard Burton must have been too modest on certain occasions to try to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and lover a verbal collage as they left home: a lively, witty and deadly dialogue, delivered as only Burton could. <br /> <br /> helps make things a lot better, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as a Brunel inspector; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the highly underrated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher, Towney, and a few other well-known characters. <br /> <br /> I liked how the story was presented, like flashback in the flashback to complete the previous story and so solve the immediate mystery. from the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer to the murderer. Until then, it was a good job as a visual detective of Brunel and his English sidekick. Nevertheless, it was very predictable because it quickly became very obvious to me about the identity of the potential killer. <br /> <br /> Then they ruined everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue to what it is, think of Samson and Dalila (1949), the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and the way Samson got the better of the bad guys. And, the very last scene is just stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways to unleash Morlar attacks, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Too bad, actually, because it could have been a better story and a better movie. I guess Burton really needed that money. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Burton, spend time seeing the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not bother.
