This is at the top of my list of the worst movies I've seen so far on Starz on Demand. They seem to take each DVD they can find and put it here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, anyone with a digital camera and a minimal budget can make a horror film and broadcast it on television. To be honest, it looked horrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to keep an open mind about low budget movies. Some of the best films I've ever seen were movies that worked around their small budget or in other cases, only required the small budget to be excellent. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You already know the plot, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you've heard about it on Starz on Demand, or for whatever reason, you found yourself on this page out of boredom. This is a shabby and pathetic girl we know for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal clip. Whoever put it up must have thought it sounded really interesting, but it really is not. In any case, she kills herself. Then she has someone. Then killings begin. It's really immutable and as average and boring as possible. When the first shot sounds in his apartment, it looks like a piece of popcorn. Was it the best sound effect they could find? I could find a better sound effect to use for free (without copyright) on the Internet ... yes. now. <br /> <br /> Do not let other critics say that this is a 10-star movie will fool you. It is obviously the distributors of the film or perhaps even the director who tries to convince you that this piece of bric-a-brac is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Pleasant.
