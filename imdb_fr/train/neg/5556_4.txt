In the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May's "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die," we've already had a silly recap and accompanying vocals for the first two movies, a hilarious scene, about three minutes of film just torn apart. from the second film and reissued slightly to look like new footage, and a long-running title character watches healed and tormented on Universal Theme Parks- Universal being the company that distributed this film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is the ideal solution to cash the success of a previous film cheaply. <br /> <br /> This time, the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake ("Darkman", played by "the actor" of "Mummy" Arnold Vosloo) mouths Peter Rooker, the lord of the crime and her lousy husband (played in a brilliant performance by Jeff Fahey), and throughout the film. film increasingly developed to develop affection for Rooker's wife and daughter, learning to take care of another person again. <br /> <br /> Blah. BLA bla. Blah. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a silly way for the studio to make even more money with Sam Raimi's original film, which I consider an excellent action-thriller. <br /> <Oh yes, and there are also a number of stupid secondary intrigues, including a nasty one who would have been one of the first doctors to save Darkman as a result of healing, and she seduced our hero by making her believe that she was an ally before revealing her evil plot to help Rooker create more superhuman thugs like Darkman. Apparently, she can not do the same procedure on the thugs she played on Darkman. Why? I can not really explain it, because the movie certainly does not do it. <br /> <br /> There is also a sub-plot of assassination involving an Attourney district that threatens to destroy Rooker's organization and other very stupid things. past. <br /> <br /> But that does not add up. This film looks like two or three episodes of a TV show mounted together more than a movie. The management alternates quite well and downright sloppy (a scene in which Darkman rides his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher, it's just silly), and editing is a mix. The film is moving too fast for anyone to really care about what's going on. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this movie, and in fact, the whole series is just a little ... I do not know ... Another 15 minutes of mixed footage. <br /> <br /> In fact, when commenting on editing, one of my favorite things in this movie is to look at the pictures of the previous films reused, then look for pictures in this movie that are repeated several times. Yes, it's so cheap. It's one thing to go back to the beginning of the movie, and maybe repeat a photo or two, but in the actual volume, they do it (minutes of repeated footage from previous movies), it's just sloppy and amateur. <BR/> <br /> In addition, I must say that Darkman's psychedelic montage freak-outs are a little exaggerated in this movie. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but in the light and in the right context, as Raimi did in the original film. Here, there are at least four or five and they feel very abrupt and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is not without positive points. Some action scenes are well done. The story of Darkman's snapshots of real life is perfect for a live film. Some actors are nice, especially Rooker's wife, represented by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. In addition, composer Randy Miller, though none of them, composes beautiful music inspired by Elfman's original themes. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film is too fast, inexpensive and ridiculous to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternately bored and exuberant from stage to stage. Fahey, while enjoying himself as an extravagant villain, just does not fit the show. <br /> <br /> I like "Darkman II", I would recommend this to fans of the original, who will surely laugh. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. A four in ten.
