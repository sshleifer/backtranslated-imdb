I gave a "2" to this movie loooooooooooong because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read like a fast reader, you will NEVER go through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish rhythm! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you can not read the subtitles. Endless looks and bad eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or two. A good cinematography, but also some so dark that you think your screen is exhausted. How it won something that I will never understand. Difficult to speak of "ACTING" because the main actors seem to look at each other and look at each other with love when they do not repel each other. Geraldo's character is so attractive that it's hard to believe that SOMEONE would push him away. And what's with his mother? I just did not get most of the time, except that there were three guys who all seem to have backgrounds with each other ... but never found out who was the "EX" .
