Cedric Kahn's films are based on characters rather than actions (I'm thinking of Boredom and Red Lights), so it's shocking to see this series of truly expert car chases interspersed with some attempts to convey character. in Succo. I do not find Stefano Cassetti an interesting actor. he reminds me of the professional athletes who are cajoled by the cinema, like Bret Favre. This empty look looks like a really nasty deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to think more about the personality of Succo, rather than admire his talent for the hijacking of cars. <br /> <br /> The little acting game that comes from there comes mainly from Isild le Besco, while schoolgirl Distressed Succo storms. The interview at the police office is a marvel of stubborn obstinacy with a little fear of the future. Besco aside, there is not much to recommend to this movie.
