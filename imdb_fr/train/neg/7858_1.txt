I understand the need to call strangers for this kind of "horror" movies, but they should at least engage some actors. The sergeant in particular is guilty of using his monotone to bulldoze every line he owns. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is not really any recognizable plot, so the writing is essentially using the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other bad ones terms rather than an appropriate dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story, as it stands, is mostly composed of seemingly random deaths and death, with some crazy "surprises", that occur about 10 minutes after seeing exactly what is happening. will pass. happen. Not only that, but there are many intriguing holes and glaring errors of continuity (why do they go there? Did not he have a weapon? Was not he dead?), This gives the impression that all the film was made reduced by the many hours it would take to repair them. <br /> <br /> Another film that simply relies on blood and blood instead of any real cinematic experience.
