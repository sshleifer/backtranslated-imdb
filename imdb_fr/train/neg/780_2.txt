This show is awful. How does George want his mother's death to be funny? This show is terrible. The parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to day care. The girl is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete kid. George is not funny, especially when he talks about his strong and obnoxious spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I laughed at him a few times, but mostly how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible and despicable character. Of course, her husband left her, but how can anyone laugh at the way she treated George as a baby beyond me? <br /> <br /> Can someone explain to me how funny George's head is? It's not even so big! I left the characters because they are too awful and I would need hours to write and, frankly, I do not care. I care enough to tell everyone who is watching her and wondering if they want to watch this show or not, that this show is a sorry excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> it starts, because the woman is extremely attractive.
