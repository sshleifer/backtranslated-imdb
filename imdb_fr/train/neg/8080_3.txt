I had high hopes for this film, since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes collapsed in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Even Heston actor or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or brief nude scenes) could not save this movie. Some of the space effects were pretty good, but others were tacky. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this one. Grade F
