This British boiler has one goal: young men are always beautiful. Older men are right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years. Young or old, however, the moral of this three-part mini-series is universally suspect and no one is doing particularly well. <br /> <br /> Nick is a handsome young gay man recently out of Oxford. It's not crucial in the story, but it has extraordinarily beautiful hair, which makes it much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father, Gerald, is a wealthy Conservative politician. He keeps his sister Cat while the family is frolicking in the south of France. They neglect to inform her that when she is upset, Cat cuts herself off with an assortment of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick takes their personal gratitude for affection and settles in, discovering too late how much they despise and protect him. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years, but as the plot depends on it, it is best not to question it. <br /> <br /> Although Nick is very pleasant to watch, he is incredibly obsequious. His timid submission to the rich fanatics soon made me climb the walls. Deeply locked up except for Cat (she guesses her big secret in plain sight), he likes a little anonymous sex just to make sure he's really gay. Although it seems hardly possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closed than him. <br /> <br /> Supercool conservatives despise and insult the two blacks in the movie, so imagine the venom that springs when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, loyal to conservative fashion, has been involved in several personal and financial scandals. The revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one last chance to chastise the unfortunate boy. <br /> <br /> Except for a brief moment of indignation, Nick assumes the violence that was inflicted on him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial, self-hatred, naivety or ignorance? You decide if you can get to sit all that without throwing something on the set.
