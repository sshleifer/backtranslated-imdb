I have fallen asleep during movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things, including: very tired, being warm and comfortable on the table and just eating a lot. However, on that occasion, I fell asleep because the movie was nil. The development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to be happening, but without any explanation of what caused them or why. I admit that I may have missed part of the film, but I watched the majority and everything seemed to happen of its own free will, without any real concern. I can not recommend this movie at all.
