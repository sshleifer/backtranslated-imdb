For this review, a list of positives and negatives.I will start with the negatives. <br /> <br /> Negatives: the casting choices (especially Burt Reynolds in Boss Hogg), the game of the badly chosen casting, the scenario, the idea of ​​placing the film in the modern world, the realization, editing, soundtrack and, above all, the idea of ​​making a feature film from a television series that was not great to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> One could do one In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke makes her way to Michael Weston as Enos and asks the question "Enos, where are Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" In her dark judgment, she tells him where they are. Perhaps she could have asked as well: "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would have darkened her judgment by saying yes, even if, in his good sense, he would have said, "No, not really." as she looked in the bikini, she could have been completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible movie. Stay out of Hazzard!
