This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake, but again, not really. I was very disappointed with Tim Burton's tools. He had great makeup, CGIs available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got is as good as the original movie that was made for under 6 million dollars? Heck no. So, in this regard, the film fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the scene of the statue of liberty was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this film, even the final scene, as it could be seen in somehow to come. And, by the way, if you think about it a little, like me, you can understand how the end could happen. I just wish I had lost time thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed in the lines of the first film and adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". This is how I would have written it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (it was really better than Marky Mark because he's not strong enough to deal with a movie on his own, so I would have put three guys) who would land on what they thought would be another planet, meet humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, linked with some good apes, discovered they were on earth by finding some destroyed ruins, ending up meeting crazy mutant humans living under the earth, a war breaks out between mutant humans and great apes, then ... well, let your imagination run the way you want to end. <br /> <br /> But what I mean is that this movie could have been much richer. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director, no matter what people think. He is plugged in, so he must be good at thinking. Sorry but no. If someone else had shot this film, it would have been much better and would have been much more satisfying.
