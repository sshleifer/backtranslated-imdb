After reading the other comments on this film, I would like to share my view that it is a hard film to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I am not. <br /> <br /> The film, seen by a purely objective observer, is an unbalanced narrative that presents more undistorted neuroses than can be absorbed in a single session. It's pretty hard to watch. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so unfriendly and uncomfortable that it is hard to understand - let alone pick on him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to another. And he should NEVER make a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic setting. No man could have so much foliage exposed and be supposed to light a baby like Kathryn Harrold - unless, of course, to be Albert Brooks in a production controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and infrequent. Most of the time, I felt like I was on a confined trip with someone totally unfriendly and wishing that it ended already. This confirms the problems that can arise when too much control of a film is placed in one person - a person who lacks self-discipline to step back and see what is happening clearly. <br /> <As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually what he described. Six years later, he sent Albert Brooks into the highly successful "Broadcast News". James showed us how Albert can create a credible and entertaining comic book performance. Albert allowed us to see James (usually not portrayed as an actor) doing a rare comic in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will have already passed the next complimentary comment. about that. To you, I say: there is enough suffering in the world without having to find it in a film intended to be an entertainment.
