It's not Michael Madsen's fault, he was barely there. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, watch this movie. Words can not describe how stupid it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All other actors are strangers. When we look at it, it's like being in a soft porn, but without nudity or hot scenes. This film had sexual connotations since it was a clandestine S & M killer. The acting was bad, except the roles of Michael Madsen. He seemed to want to laugh. I hope he was well paid for this shabby movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even a movie B for cable, it looks more like an F and it should never be broadcast.
