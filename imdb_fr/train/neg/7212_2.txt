Why every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is for me a complete enigma, because the "classic" of William Friedkin is a very overestimated film and, in my opinion, not so tense nor so shocking. And yet here is another pure and simple scam, this time Spanish, which shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who is possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who, I must admit, looks very hot here) plays the honorable priest to whom John Gibson addresses because the behavior of his sister Leila has changed dramatically since she met her new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe in it, but when you discover John's body with the twisted neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is not only very original, it's also an unbearably boring film! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch have had the opportunity to make a religious-themed movie full of shocks and gores, yet the result is a tame, bloodless drama that will almost lull you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain atmospheric moments, though very stupid, and there are quite a few scenes of female nudity and thin films. The absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse since Paul Naschy has already proved that he had enough imagination to overcome a shortage of money. This is just a horrible movie, the end of the story. The other European scams of "The Excorcist" are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they are also worthless!
