It's certainly one of the most bizarre movies ever made - even for Fellini. SATYRICON is pretty much the only stranger. It's two-thirty in a strange, nightmarish world of decadence, opulence, and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a casanova curiously unattractive and the strange stories of a series of unrelated vignettes drawn from the autobiography of the great lover fail to interest the viewer. Artistic direction and costume design are exceptional, however. The Academy has failed not to name the first but has done itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the second. Also nominated (oddly), the scenario was disjointed, useless and almost inaccessible. Go understand !! The video is only 150 minutes long, 16 minutes shorter than the original duration. This spectator was grateful.
