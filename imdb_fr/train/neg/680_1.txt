I finally caught "Starlight" last night on TV and all I can say is. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - the incredibly hokey special effects (watch out for Willie's laser beams!), The atrocious play, the heavy dialogue, the improper use of screen sequences or the air of pretentious seriousness infuses the entire production. It's truly a unique experience, and we should all be grateful. I propose Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood!
