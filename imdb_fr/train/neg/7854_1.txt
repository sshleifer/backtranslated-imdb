wow it's the worst movie of all time. the only reason I signed up for IMDb was to be able to complain about this movie. I never left a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped it (and I should have). but I watched it until the end, just to let myself go down with an absolutely terrible ending. wow, if that's all we can do, his time is up. I have never seen the first one and I will never look at it again. his terrible acting with a terrible plot. hey look someone shows us a mirror, let's see. And what's sad is that when this movie came on DVD, it was completely checked out forever. so I feel bad for everyone who has seen this junk.
