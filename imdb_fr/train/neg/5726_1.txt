An obvious B level effort to take advantage of the Buzz / Vu hostel, my expectations for this movie were low (very low!) Yet it still managed to disappoint at all levels. The acting is so bad that it's not even funny, the plot is non-existent and the only fear was to realize that I had lost 1 hour and 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to see that 34 people gave it a 10-star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of them are actors. The 34th is perhaps the director of mothers? - Although I'm sure it would be hard to beat a 2! DVD supplements include a one-hour "production preparation". Which raises the question "Why?" (Although this may serve to show what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
