Eric Rohmer's "Lady and the Duke" is based on the diaries of an English aristocrat who experienced the French Revolution. But it is an elevated affair, with its strange and painted decorations and its mannered conversation tone. More particularly, this portrait of the time of terror runs almost entirely away from real action; In this film, we see very few ordinary people and little chaos, poverty and terror that took place far from the salons of aristocratic classes persecuted but spoiled. The result is often dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes push societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.
