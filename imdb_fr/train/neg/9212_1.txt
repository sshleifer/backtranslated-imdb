the only value of this film is basically to laugh at the gravity of the situation. with a plot that makes your middle-school writer look good, and acting almost as well gives the lowest score. a tom hanks movie very early where he obviously did not have the pleasure of being difficult. The best special effect of the movie is a guy wearing an incredibly fake rubber monster consumption.
