I am of Puerto Rican origin, I had mixed answers about this "documentary". I was initially offended that Ms. Perez compared Senator Campos to Che Guevarra. Also, just a point of fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puerto Rican origin. His parents are from Columbia. Anyone doing research on it was not very specific. I think the future of our race is based on education. This message should have resonated throughout this movie. Education is our path to freedom and power. I think that any future effort of this production team should make it its goal. In my opinion, this film was influenced by an anti-American feeling.
