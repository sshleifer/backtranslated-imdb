I always thought that a good movie should have a plot. There was one missing, and I think it would have been more effective with a conspiracy. This was compounded by the fact that it seemed to last forever; I could not wait for it to end finally. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes; it had been four hours. Not only was there no conspiracy but the film also lacked significant conflict. It's not the worst film I've seen, but I said it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So, do not think that this criticism is of someone who only needs action. I hate most action movies released today; it's just that this movie is completely on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the decor and costumes were nice.
