A teenager who seems to have everything to commit suicide. That leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) to ask a lot of questions ... and to blame himself. <br /> <br /> Good idea, poorly managed. For starters, this was done before 1988 - mainly in television movies and specials after school. Except for a few curses and dialogues (hence the PG-13 rating), it does not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts to act have been really painful to watch. He is good NOW but not in 1988. In addition, his character was dressed like a slut and always looked so dirty that it was difficult to arouse sympathy. <br /> <br /> That aside, the film is dull. I saw each scene coming and each "surprise" was telegraphed. Basically, I could not wait for this case to end. <br /> <br /> I vaguely remember seeing her in a theater in 1988 and hating her (she bombarded BAD). It still looks ugly almost 20 years later. The subject is worth treating, but it is better done (with better interpretation) in countless other films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this one.
