Maybe I've seen a police movie too much or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> It was the most clich√© film, the unsatisfactory scenario, the absurd scenario, just stupid seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the direction, it seems that it took less time to show it than to put it in place. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that pass directly to the video before it is over. <br /> <br /> It's a bad scam of "M", the classic Fritz Lang movie starring Peter Lorre. You would be so much better to praise that instead.
