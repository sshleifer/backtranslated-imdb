I spent almost two hours watching a movie that, in my opinion, deserves to be watched with all the good actors. I could not believe it at the end of the movie and I did not know what had happened ... I was angry because I could have used this time to do something else ... really had no idea. Thank you to those who understood and explained it ... True or false, it's better than not knowing anything! Who was the black haired lady we saw hunting several times in the movie? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the film, Kate said that she would eventually discover the truth. Does this mean that we will be subject to End Game 2?
