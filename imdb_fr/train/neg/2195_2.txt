The brain that does not die is a terrible movie that stinks in the opening credits. It presents all the classic signs of bad action: incredible plot, dreadful acting, poor scenery and lighting. The plot is this: when a doctor and his fiancee are caught in an accident, she is decapitated, he lifts his head and takes him to the laboratory where he puts it in a saucepan with a special liquid that keeps it alive. I bet Virgnina Leath, who played her head in a saucepan, spent a lot of uncomfortable time wearing it around her neck and sitting under a table. Anyway, the doctor then tries to find a new body and hires two strippers so she can choose one to have his new body. Throughout the operation, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 was torn apart.
