Richard Dreyfuss is actually in this film, but in a small part. He is NOT the "obsessed" filmmaker - he is the group's chief executive / accountant. Even the box describes the film incorrectly. As advertised, there are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, unless one uses the term "erotic" rather vaguely. I would never have considered watching the film without Richard Dreyfuss as the main character. I could have realized, however, that Leonard Cohen's famous '60s hymn' had an artistic influence. Aside from the brief recitation of James Joyce's ending lines of "Ulysses" and an interesting visual reference at the end of Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal", I found it a poor attempt to melt symbolic elements and atmospheres immortalized in films like "Last Year in Marianbad" and "An Andalusian Dog". If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic troupe, there are many top-quality films, from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
