OK, this was one of the worst excuses 4 of a movie I had the misfortune to watch. Like all other Olsen twins, with the possible exception of the New York Minute, this movie had no history, gaping intrigues, disgusting acting, and even a bad shoot! !!!!!! in case you have not guessed it yet, I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I looked was because I was really bored and nothing else was lit. I wonder if the twins will ever stop doing the same stereotypical movies where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the day while waiting for the help of two cute guys who immediately drool over it. The least they could do would be to have a 4 1 guy or both of them 4 of the same guy. The plot in this story was so stupid and just stupid. even a toddler could see the flaws. Maybe they should separate and start making movies individually or maybe movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who liked this movie is not a crime, either really stupid, really artificial or did not see a very good movie. or maybe they are really smart and have bad cinematographic choices. Anyway, I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy for a good cinematic experience. The only thing that makes it good is a burst of laughter that laughs at the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you look for laughs, it's hilarious. basically, I give it 0 or less.
