This film was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid scenario, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is portrayed as always perverse. The naive Hollywood communist sympathizers, most of whom are as stupid as a box of stones, love to take over the lonely puzzle of Eugene McCarthy and imagine him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a marginal figure who exploited a legitimate concern about Soviet communists for political ends. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and the United States brought all those nasty Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. In fact, he loved to be American and became a valuable asset to the country. <br /> <br /> And yet, the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, a poorly educated group that lives a fantastic existence, still believe that the government should handle everything. and give us all what we want. And yet, it's the same government they continually describe as an evil consumed in movies like this one.
