This version was a little slow for my taste and I guess I have problems with this piece first. But first, the film is a typical version of a television piece, which means it does not have the flair of the original version of the film with William Holden. What could they afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the film until 1966? So you can say a few words to the little sister about the protests against the Vietnam War? Why not 1963 and give him a line on the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> Regarding casting, some hit misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, misses a lot of notes. He is credible as an ex-BMOC jock but he does not have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla if all the women in the city put themselves on it (forgive the pun). Gretchen Moll was adorable but she seemed a bit too wise for the character she was playing. She did not project the innocence or ignorance required by the character. It may be because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But again, Holden was ten years older. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgotten because the mother and Mary Steenburgen could not decide, that she plays Blanche duBois or Katharine in "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> As far as Mr. Inge is concerned, I've always felt that stories like that of a young woman who values ​​passion to practice always need an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone", I believe, offers a likely epilogue with the episode "Spur of the Moment", in which a young Diana Hyland was pursued by a bitter Diana Hyland, as the young Diana Hyland had chosen to run away with a guy similar to Hal Carter.
