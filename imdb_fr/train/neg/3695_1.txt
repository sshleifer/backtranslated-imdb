Not the best of actors movies. The director focused on the celebrity of the projected actor rather than giving a good artist. Maybe the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans will enjoy it.But it's sure it's not worth it for a neutral audience.The fight sequences are a total comedy.The dance steps in the Song sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the hype created during the film, the film failed miserably. Do not even think about watching this move even if you want to kill time. You can watch cartoons instead. A good movie buff can not digest this shit for two and a half hours.
