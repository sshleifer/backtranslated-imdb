A nice movie made for the TV movie that follows pretty much the killer insect script. Ants mysteriously turn into deadly ants near a hotel. I think it comes from the hotel food as the sewage from the hotel kitchen flows directly into the ant bed. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. Watching a group of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Section The stupidity of the hero is almost incredible. It is said that the health inspector that ants could not be the hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says that, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys the huge colony of ants. This disturbs the millions of ants and traps the residents of the hotel. <br /> <br /> End of the evening, this movie is extremely lame. I do not understand why a DVD is out when so many deserving films do not have one. My only hypothesis regarding the release of the DVD is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film. It's a movie to avoid.
