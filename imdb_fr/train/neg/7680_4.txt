Snow White is in my opinion a bad film artistically. The plot is more or less predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. In any case, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a straight commercial thing. To include a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the group he is shooting with in the film - the band is called SENS UNIK) seems to be aimed at a wider audience. A German-Swiss straight film would not have been sold in French - and vice versa. What really pissed me off was the product placements throughout the movie. The scenes of Sometines remember advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme "young people who take drugs with no other target in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be developed with more care. I hope that Samir will have enough money with Snow White for his next film to show his true artistic talents.
