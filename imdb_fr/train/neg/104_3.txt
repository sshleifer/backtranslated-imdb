On her way to a small town that is off the beaten track (but looks strangely close to a highway), a journalist meets a strange hitchhiker who agrees to help her direct her to her destination. The strange man then tells two horrible stories related to the region: in the first story, a plot for adultery aimed at killing the wife's husband, but which will end up suffering a lot worse when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers sees his vacation shorten when an undead outlaw takes the shadows of seeing his grave stung on it. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to do a zombie themed anthology - a good idea, but with only two stories, it falls terribly short. And that's not the only way this low budget gory film fails: the acting is ugly (with Joe Haggerty, Ebenezer Jackson's narrator, giving one of the strangest shows I've ever seen. have never seen); the sites are not inspired; the script is sad; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end ... well, that beggar belief. <br /> <br /> Let's be fair, some of Sykes' creative photographic work is effective (although the artful technique used as a character running through the woods Joe Castro is excited about Joe Castro's cheapo gore: an ear is bitten eyeballs are torn off, a face is removed, brains are crushed and a messy decapitation These positive points make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, even for the spectators seasoned with Z-grade garbage. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but I generously increase my score to 3 because I could not watch the movie with the benefits of 3D ( even if I sneakily suspect that an extra dimension would not have made such a big difference).
