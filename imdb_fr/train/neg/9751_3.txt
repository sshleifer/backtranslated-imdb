The only reason I do not give less than 3 stars to this film is because it's not quite up to a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is extremely boring and terribly, unforgivably British. The premise of this film seems potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they took was totally uninteresting. It was more a movie about research funding and butterflies than laser projection. The actors were wooden, impassive and distant. As was the romantic relationship between the two scientists - which was anything but intriguing. I was never able to say what was the attraction between them because chemistry was non-existent. I did not really understand why the sullen-faced main character decided to slaughter everyone he had met. At least now, I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before cutting their research grants, otherwise they go wild, killing without reason by awkward gestures.
