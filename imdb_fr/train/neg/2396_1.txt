I just saw this movie on TV and I must admit I was a little surprised that this is the case. There was so much blunder, mess and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting game was OK, but please, you can really feel the feeling "Directly to the video". The actors / teams have made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait ten minutes before the end to hear it. Believe me, you would not even make the difference.
