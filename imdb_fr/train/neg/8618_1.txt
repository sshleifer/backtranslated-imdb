Incredibly horrible film. I watched some of that on T.V recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a horribly conceived plot and listened to a numbing voice. Not a single line of the master of one-liners could produce anything that looks like a chuckle. It was so bad that I wanted to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him, and shout, "How could you?" I know that a lot of movies are hastily shot, hoping to take advantage of the popularity of a particular actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people are supposed to pay to see such guts. The bottom of the cesspool, even Sunday afternoon to television standards.
