The major flaw with the film is its uninspired storyline. He goes through the vignettes of Bettie's story and the recreations of Klaw's short films. Although the recreations of Klaw are well done, it is useless to recreate them almost in their entirety. Page Richards, while not an extraordinary actress, does a decent job overall. And sometimes she looks a lot like Bettie. Attention should also be paid to the details. The costumes and the clothes are well made, as is the direction taken. The sets are usually sparse and give the impression of a scene, but do not feel at the time. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color scheme has been clearly designed to give the overall look a retro and vibrant atmosphere.
