It's a terrible film, a terrible scenario, a bad direction and an absurd ending. Also, poor performance, with the exception of Clancy Brown who is criminally underutilized here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was a purgatory - you do it to unload enough movie karma to see a good karma farther down the line. <br /> <br /> The film presents a father and son who look like they may not have been related. The part of the main male role is not well written and seems not very charismatic in this role. You can see the points of the plot at one kilometer. The actions of the main woman and that of her brother, the cop, also have no meaning. Thus, a major action on his part at the end of the film makes no sense in the scenario.
