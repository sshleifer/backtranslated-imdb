I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to leave. It was a bad idea to start, first a pregnant man, but then they tried to make a parody of it. What were they all these real pregnant men ??? It was the worst movie I have ever seen. If there were enough votes, it would be in the bottom of the IMDB 100 base. If it was possible to give him a zero, I would have it, and I would still feel that I had given him too much credit.
