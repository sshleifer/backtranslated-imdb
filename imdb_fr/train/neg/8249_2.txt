Hello everyone, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really bad. Think "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing is fine, nothing is consistent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. However, as indicated, three unacceptable points concern this mutilated potential of a film. <br /> <br /> A) Under Jennifer Love Hewitt's poster, there will be hordes of guys who will gracefully submit to this viewing. just to see little Hewitt with tight clothes. To tell you guys now ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really a weak eye candy. The "possibilities" here are diluted. Nevertheless, I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene, you know what ..... titillating! <br /> <br /> B) The end is romantic and positive. This is a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays the role of a loving and friendly guy ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worthy of your 10 dollars approximately. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend. Even if I'm going to take it back for the moment ..... it will depend a lot on his next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and his sister is really stupid. Her husband is really stupid ... and damn, she's really stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can not wait for the next love In fact with JLH!
