First of all, I would like to say that the comments of the users alone left me with tears in the eyes of laughter. A comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is just about the brand. MST3000 made this live. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the feverish dream of a 1959 10-year comic book reader, you'll be in control of this sucker. All the elements are there: the pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often hilarious infantile. Teen boy's attitude towards sex, with captain "gigolo" (good call to that one, guys!) Who looks at the "scientist" buxom with hair so red that it's a miracle that this does not trigger the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so foreign that everything shines in red, yet an alien monster has a mouse face and the blob stranger has an eye that turns like a child's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who seems to never finish the 8th year in Brooklyn and who has a psychotic fixation on his ray rifle. And of course, the simple fact that the stranger = dangerously wrong. If these people had met E.T., they would have roasted it in two seconds! "OW" indeed! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I evaluated this film down. Still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all the more ridiculous), and you have to admit it, in your little child's heart, it makes you jump several times. <br /> <br /> Okay, so do not admit it. I guess you've never been 10 years old.
