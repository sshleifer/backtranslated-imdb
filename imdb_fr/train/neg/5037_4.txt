Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is coming in a week. As Melissa is beautiful, all the boys of the city want to meet her, but the few who manage to capture her interest die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it, which is not a valid reason to rush and see a movie. When I started to watch it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" was not a very good slasher, but that it was really boring and boring and was not going anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders took place and the story did not really develop. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot with very beautiful photos and a good staging but as in many other slasher. films from the 80s, the film suffers from being sometimes too dark. The acting is actually pretty good and Melissa's character is easy to understand, even if she's a complete bitch. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not completely bad, but it's too boring to stay interested, The only thing that caught my attention was Melissa, she was superb and Dana Kimmel, who was really adorable and cute in this movie. Do not recommend it to Slasher fans.
