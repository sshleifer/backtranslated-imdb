With its masterpiece MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be considered as the absolute nadir of the genre that started so well with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE EXTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it is of no interest to a relatively mature audience, but rather to TEN-YEAR-OLDS, who can count only the body bags, and to it's worth it. And if rudeness is king and the king is rudeness. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is just illiterate ?? in general, he has the ability to tell stories to Bart Simpson. Since he can not read his only inspiration is the cinema. <br /> <br /> It is true that cinema is not such a bad starting point because it has generally escaped the onslaught of "realism". But these films are just the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to write, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. Still, it should be clear to any undergraduate student that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least, AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what's wrong. One can almost imagine that pathetic fool seated on his desk trying to find something SCARY. <br /> <br /> No, you notice, try to accurately describe the horror of the system of which it is an integral part, the stupid stupid, but trying to tell a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose you are paralyzed and people think you are dead and begin to open up as they do at these autopsies! Would not it be serious? And that, boys and girls, is history. <br /> <br /> What about characterization? Oh yes, he's one of those suits, who never really enjoyed life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he shouts ?? well, they really can not hear it, you know ?? he says he's going to sue the hospital, but he's no longer a big player, you see, lying there (or is he laying, I'll never remember) and everything. And he said to himself: Oh no please, do not cut me off and it's terrible, lying (or lying down) like that ?? now, would not it be a beautiful story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was this great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of this snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG ?? it sounds good, does not it? <br /> <br /> Let's do a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Of course, Steve, it's great ?? except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, moron! But how can you really say that the target audience is children, not just mental defects? It's easy: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is one, but it's the kind seen by a slit in the door of our parents' room. Modern filmmakers attach great importance to the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the hunt. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what's going on. There is nothing but laughter outside the SM club and the fascist creed that people with sexual preferences are inherently bad. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain size gap, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no real titillation, he must torture it first ?? not at all, it could excite him, you understand, because it would upset our puritanical feelings. And so, horror and romance simply become an inconvenience and grooming of psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist and can only have fun if someone touches him, you know, over there with you know ?? rubber gloves (laugh). And that's what they use in autopsy, and that's how they find out he's, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the author lives up to his powers of inspiration. Too bad, they cut everything, because it might have bothered the five years of watching the show!
