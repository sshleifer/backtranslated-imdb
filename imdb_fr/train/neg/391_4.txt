For the first two seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a very engaging and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week interview was innovative and the producers of the series managed to maintain the relevance of the series and not to spread it too much. <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more. that a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In previous seasons, they put a lot more emphasis on business-related tasks - now the main focus is on the conference room where candidates are supposed to do ANYTHING to keep them on the show (this means stabbing, etc.). The meeting room can be fun to watch, but it's an entertainment at its lowest point - sometimes you wonder if you're watching a rehearsal of an old episode of Jerry Springer. The tasks of the series are at most boring and especially a showcase for companies stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what's the problem with half of the competitors living in tents during season 6? It's just stupid and it has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for the competitors this season, they all seem like idiots. In previous seasons, some competitors had at least some integrity. It now seems that competitors would kill their own mother to keep them in the series. It also seems that Donald Trump's massive ego is getting bigger and bigger for every passing season and, to be honest, I do not see why a sensible person would want to work for him. His rationality in the meeting room usually does not make sense and sometimes it seems that he just likes to ruin people for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please NBC, for God's sake, remove the show from the air as soon as possible. It's too embarrassing to watch. The apprentice was once an excellent TV show, but now it's just a big joke.
