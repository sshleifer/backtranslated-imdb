Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I thought the movie was not the best I had seen. At the end of the movie, I felt I was missing something. <br /> <br /> However, Bette Davis did a perfect job, she made me hate her and complained her all the time. Leslie Howard played very well as lovelorn Philip Carey and I complained so much throughout the movie of being in love with such a horrible woman. It's so sad to be in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, although pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, the acting game was what happened and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not one to give it. Although others may find this film good, I was one who found it just about everything. I should recommend this film to those who love bad seeds so that they can see what can happen to them if they are in love with this horrible character.
