Sorry, my neighbors, neighbors Nevada City, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have too much botox because he had very few facial expressions in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Alice seemed to have a board attached to her back. She was stiff throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I looked up at Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the bio extended from his work. I would have supposed they were freshmen. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason wore the film frankly with their jokes and ease at each line. Ed certainly did not lose his charisma. I would have liked to take the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I like the snow scenes and the store and church scenes because I went there. I moved to Nevada City and looked forward to the first. I was unfortunately disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
