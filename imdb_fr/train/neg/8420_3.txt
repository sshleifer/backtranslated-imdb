Despite the excellent cast, it is a banal movie, especially from the point of view of aviation. It may be a little better than the huge "von Richthofen and Brown" but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best of a small market over the past 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate on what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new high quality WW I film.
