This movie is just horrible. It's boring, it's mediocre quality, the actors are only the worst actors I've ever seen and the screenplay is so bad it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor is supposed to be the sexy guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All characters are absent for the weekend to meet friends, but no one is really friends! The married couple did not see the "main" guy for more than 5 years and even then, they were not really friends. The "appointment" of the main man knows him only from work and there is a girl they take in a bar. Tell me now that you could lose your job if you spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste even a minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies more scary than that! <br /> <br />
