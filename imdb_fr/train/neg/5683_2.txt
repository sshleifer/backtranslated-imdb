From the beginning of the movie, I had the feeling that it was a movie about another Jason on Friday 13. And it's ... Dispute that the film starts interesting. But over time, there's just one useless movie about a silent, supernatural and silent serial killer. I mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, no one sees it. He was supposed to be blind after a failed execution, but he walks and kills people as before. I am tired of him. For me it's the same thing. <br /> <br /> In other words, unreal. Too many errors and confusing information. <br /> <br /> A busy scene with an impressive woman, but that seemed awesome, but right at the first time:}
