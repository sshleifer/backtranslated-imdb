The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has already been gold with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went into the film (in an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the smooth promises. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before him, this movie was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have already pointed out, the principle of the film, which was already obsolete to begin with, is only stretching constantly and without further development or superposition. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had watched it at home, it would have been much easier to reduce my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is at best average and John Abraham should no longer try to do comedy. Aspects of the film's comedy have been pretty good week. I only remember laughing twice the whole movie. Certainly no side laughter that consumes me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, as his role and character did not have much room to develop, he did not have much impact in this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who only made an appearance in the film, was fun to watch when she was on screen. And some songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you'd better just play this movie.
