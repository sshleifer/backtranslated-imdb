A reasonable effort is summarized for this film. A good film of the sixties but devoid of any sense of merit. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough but not as good as she could have done, other actors were just awful! A terrible portrait. It was not very funny and the genres were not really realized, neither particularly funny nor dramatic. The only genre reached at a satisfactory level was romance. Target audiences were not affected and the movie sent confusing messages. A basic plot and a very simple scenario were not realized or interpreted, and people were confused as to why the film was not so good and who the target audience was, etc. However, Maggie was very good and the scenario was good with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
