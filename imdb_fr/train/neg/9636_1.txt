This amazing waste of production money is the film evidence that rich and celebrities can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a Tennessee Williams (stupid) play and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular island mansion at the top of a cliff in the Mediterranean must have seemed to be a sure fire winner when it was introduced to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it defies almost every belief. Visually, the film is spectacular, but it is the strength of nature that has allowed the staging and the fact that a real house is used instead of a decor. The shrill whistles of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half-asleep wanderings, wacky dialogue, Noel Coward mocking himself, ridiculous history, plots and absurd costumes simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent and a clear proof that famous people can be idiots, just like the rest of the planet's population. Not even fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking loss.
