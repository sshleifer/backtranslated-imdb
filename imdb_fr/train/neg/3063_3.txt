The images that usually glorify a hero make sense. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you really felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught in the depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has absolutely no substance. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon appears as a folk hero. Why? He drives along a road in Idaho on his way to the hospital where his distraught wife was taken. Nobody cares to understand why he is trying to escape everyone. Worse, when it becomes clear that he is not a red-throat terrorist, no member of the government wants to help him in his attempt to save their backs. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley plays the role of co-starring radio host who relies on the story to support our hero. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely incredible.
