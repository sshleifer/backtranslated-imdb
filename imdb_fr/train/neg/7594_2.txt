Given the story of the director of this film, it is hard to believe that this film was terribly bad. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the executive producers was present. He was still watching the movie and, boy, was he a surprise. I have not read the book on which it is based, and I do not know if it is very appreciated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and saw how it was adapted to the screen and how bad this movie was, I can only assume that something similar happened here. The acting was not bad, even though there were a couple of too many eyebrows on Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared about all the characters in this movie. Situations take place on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. The part of Donald Sutherland includes some scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes it. I continued to watch my watch while I was not afraid of dialogue on the screen. I never left a movie, but I was tempted to start during this time. I gave this film a score of "2" for reasons that seem terribly superficial, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the scene of the earthquake too short and the second is that Salma Hayek undressed and became beautiful. I can say a little more positive about this film. Do not ask anything to dust, she can not speak!
