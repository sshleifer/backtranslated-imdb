This concerns Zatoichi's films as the films of "Star Trek" were meant for "Star Trek" - except that in this case, each of the originals was more fun and interesting than this great, brilliant redo, and also better done, if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought it beautiful, but empty; since I had it, I found his style inappropriate and insufficient content. The idea of ​​relaunching the character into a larger and smoother production must have sounded good, but it makes no sense, other than the hope of making money; it's just a show, which usually fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and fails to take the character wherever he has not been (the actor was not at his best ). I had hoped to see Ichi at an advanced stage of his life, in a story that would come out gracefully and draw a conclusion from his overall experience; it only remembers fragments of other films, seasoned with more sexual and sexual violence. Not the same experience at all.
