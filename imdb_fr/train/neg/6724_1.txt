When choosing a movie, I hope a factor will be taken into account: do film actors use their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? It's not a political statement, it's a moral issue that affects society. When a comedian / actor makes a sexual and racist remark about a teenager and her father, we should ask ourselves (do I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's behavior tears apart the social fabric that teaches our youth the right of evil, the good behavior of evil, benevolent goodness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should remember that it is only entertainment and that we have a lot left to choose from. Saying sorry does not pull him off. It will not hurt the bad and will not eliminate the bad behavior that it spreads among our young people. One way to stop this behavior is to no longer be a fan. Do not see anything they are part of. We can not change them but we can stop the fame we give them.
