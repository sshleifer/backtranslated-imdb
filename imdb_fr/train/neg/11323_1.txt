This movie will promote the improvement of the spirit. Read a book! It is incredible that anyone who thinks this film deserves the time and investment needed. I have already seen some "B" movies but the movie "C" has just been invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy the Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching, but I found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes after the start of Knights. High school productions are better than that and the actors involved must erase that from their resume. The embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to my mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies, has even turned it off. Now, it must really tell you something. If you watch this movie and you like it, I will pray for you.
