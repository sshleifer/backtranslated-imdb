I can not believe that those who rent this movie do not think about another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that it was awful, but the script (or lack thereof) creates an equally useless movie. On the positive side, the general level of skill on the part of the actors and the technical team is quite competent, but when you have a sow ear, you can not make a silk handbag. Ben G fans should stick to any other movie in which he went. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Lovers of laughter at the expense of those who seem to be asking for this should stick to Peter B's incredibly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.
