Murders are taking place in a desert Texas town. Who is responsible? Slight novelties of mystery and racial tension (the latter is not really suitable), but strictly reserved for fans of slasher, who will appreciate the gore and nudity, two classic elements of these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from the infamous 13th PART 3) plays the role of the young, almost-detective teenager. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: R rated for violence and bloody, nudity and a bit of language.
