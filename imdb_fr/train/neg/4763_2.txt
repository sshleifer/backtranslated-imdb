The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "revision" of a superb 1972 movie-worthy play, a horrible experience. If I can save someone from watching, I will have done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh accepts a set of ugly and sterile notes. He then proceeds to film from all possible artistic, distracting and egocentric angles. We see reflections of stainless steel actors, safety screens, head shots 200 feet above, big eyes, chin, etc. The script, written by a Nobel laureate, introduces long periods of uncomfortable homosexual jokes, which are simulated by both parties, .... I think ?? Given the character "Twists", how would I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are rude and unsympathetic. The operating time has been reduced by one hour, the real problem, or the kindest thing the director has done for us. The actors effectively interpret their lines, but nothing they say or do is credible. Jude Law is more than Caine, but as a credited producer, he must have had Branagh's blessing. <br /> <br /> In the end, I thought it was an ugly look, an unconvincing shell of an old classic. Why was it even made ??? The paying public has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A vanity work that fails at every turn.
