Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the screenplay should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come until Q takes Enterprise to the Gamma area, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk meets them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to be called Enterprise ... should I continue? Berman and Pilliar scoffed at the creation of Gene Roddenberry. After his death, they only saw $$$$ and followed their own path. No wonder Majel Barrett has participated in every episode of Star Trek until this series. I do not blame him for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula He is a great actor, as are all actors. I love them all, but the scenario is tragic and ignores all the precedents established by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people have watched Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
