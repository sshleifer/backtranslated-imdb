The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this film interesting. Well, it's not. It was a very boring movie, written and done in an amateur way. All the actors in this film are awful, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a pleasure to watch. But too much time has been spent on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with crows and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such an Argentinian accent that you can only understand all the words he says. Also present, Nicholas Pauls, who plays the role of an ultra-loving lover for Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene: the last five to ten minutes of the film. I would have given this star a star, but three because I love Faye Dunaway so much. But even she was not so good at it.
