* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know that creativity has not been there when this puppy was designed. The movie is your basic slasher movie at a low budget. Oh, of course, he tries to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that it was just a joke anyway. Ok, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in the city starts going out with her colleague. He invites him into his circle of friends and at a party, they tell him that they have a "murderous club" and that they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that everything was a joke, but not before our heroine kills a woman in a garage. Now, the "members" of the Murder Club are murdered one by one. Oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. At this point, you will not really care anymore. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes of this film have no meaning. The motivation for the killings at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say it's a way for the director to extract the movie, but on the DVD there are scenes deleted! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the long version of "Bleed", but apparently the DVD makers thought that viewers would demand more. On the box, it is said that there are Easter eggs, but why I would like to waste my time looking for extras in this film exceeds me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie and "Bleed" was introduced in this regard. But it was not a bad fun movie. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there is a lot of nudity, but the acting is awful. My least favorite character is the one who ends up being the killer ... I think he's supposed to be funny and fun, but he ends up becoming a tool. I think the funny part of the movie is when our heroine kills the woman in the parking lot, in a hilarious and unconvincing death. The heroine pushes the women into the cement pole of the garage, and it looks like she is barely hitting, spitting blood and "dying". <br /> <br /> For those who think that making a film is a complex and creative process done by professionals, check out "Bleed". That will change your mind, and you will realize that any hacking can be done by a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time and money on it.
