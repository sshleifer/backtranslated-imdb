Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with making lame social comments about a real event, but does not have the balls to document legitimately what happened. The obvious message (we even have a laughable scene of the two boys) is the constant rhetoric of the violence of video games (I feel that Ben Coccio is a passionate gamer), or the total lack of influence of media and music on music. burn ALL their CDs, talk about subtlety!), but the film only gets away because it's a "fiction". Good try. Yes, it's a great idea to dispel the influence of the media, but how do we know that children who planned and executed a shootout in a school were not influenced by the media? or video games? We do not like, and we will not do it with this movie, because again, these kids are smart enough to completely abandon the media, but stupid enough to burn a Nazi symbol on the floor? haha, I do not believe it at all. <br /> <br /> The film surprises you with its portrait of the normality of families, it is almost wrong to think that there was no serious defect in the dynamic family of children who came out and shot on their classmates. Why is everyone so keen to make killers appear "normal" when they are obviously not? A completely false and factitious representation.
