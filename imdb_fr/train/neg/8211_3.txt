I read Heinrich Harrer's book "7 years in Tibet" and I was fascinated by it. so I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98, I liked it a little. Well, now I've looked at him again with all the knowledge of the book he's based on. and I quickly realized how wrong it was: <br /> <br /> When they enter Lhasa, people start to pull their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt get the impression that it's is the way to say hello to Tibet In the book, Harrer explains that pulling the tongue is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty to Tibet and that they may do so in the face of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two. Europeans! not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses to the public. In the book, Harrer mentions that no one in Tibet was wearing glasses at that time (sorry, I forgot the reason, but the book also explains it). The young Dalai Lama did it, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about the look of Mao tse tung, who destroys the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha" ?? childish ... and the Tibetan clothes Harrer and Aufschnaiter custom are not costumes of European designers! why have so many events that have really happened been eliminated from history, to simply fill the time with a fictitious interest in love (the tailor ...) that does not matter? just like the whole story of his son's harrers, rolf. Not a word is mentioned about him or even any family member to harrer in the book. but it suited me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about harrers person. it's on the tibet. I am very disappointed by this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet heinrich harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for cinematography.
