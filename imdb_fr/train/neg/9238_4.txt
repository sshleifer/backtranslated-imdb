Comedy of a note that probably puts the teeth of feminists nowadays on the edge. Betsy Drake, a shop assistant, is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage. She hopes a lot in women's magazines until she spies a super bait in the form of an elegant boy, Cary Grant. The rest of the film progresses from one stratagem to another while the intrepid Drake continues his career. I guess the word "perky" pretty much sums up how Drake approaches the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her denture, I started to overdose. Grant's role is fundamentally secondary and less his usual talent. There is, however, a scene that almost saves this slender exercise. Drake questions the unhappy Grant following his lecture in front of a room full of respectable ladies. Here, his way of life has a non-forced freshness that is truly remarkable and, if the production had not rubbed our noses in this optimistic smile for 90 minutes, the film could have represented more than the dream of a girls' camp. , around 1948.
