In general, I do not write reviews, but I do not understand why this is so high and I wanted to give a warning to horror fans, because I can only assume that all these high ratings were awarded by viewers means. I only watched the first two episodes, but these two were so clich√©s that it was even more funny. the same old stories that you've probably already seen / read several times already - live toys, perverse things of other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they're also bad versions of these shots. I would prefer for example "chucky" and "silent hill" on these two episodes at any time. and do not even ask questions about the visual effects ... those of the first episode go well, but those of the second ... horrible. Looks like a film student's project went wrong. blood ... or bloody ... uh ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> this could be of interest to a ten-year-old who probably has not seen / read so many scary stories yet (although I would rather recommend "beyond belief" - that's what I 'calls a decent mystery TV show). but for an adult horror fan, it's worthless. I only gave the 3 points because there is actually beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and acting.
