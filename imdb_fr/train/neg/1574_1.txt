There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A film based on a car with a throttle blocked, no brakes and a shifter blocked the automatic transmission can not be good! I would have stopped this car in a minute if I was inside or in the police car that was following her constantly. I'm sorry for the actors who had to endure such a poor scenario. The few scenes where some similarities with the action have been greatly oversized and as far removed from reality as you can get. In addition, there were a lot of blunders, for example the hood of the fleeing car, which was blown up at 100 mph. At first, he simply bent over the windshield, as it would have been the case in reality, but then flew away. The car was later seen in the movie with the hood .... <br /> <br /> This movie was only embarrassing, stay away!
