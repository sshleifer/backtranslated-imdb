... the first movie I had to leave. And it was the preselection of the actors and the team (it's not that I was involved, I hasten to add). I spent the first hour so I think I'm qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other reviews here, how did this go through any type of quality assurance. An accumulation of the worst dialogues, the quintessence of wooden acting, a horrible cast, all assembled without intrigue. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comical. She has the worst Russian accent in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> At the time of leaving the screening, the director and the producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. Obviously, they could not come back to it either. <br /> <br />
