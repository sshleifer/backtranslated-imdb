This woman who works as a trainee at a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. Then, she will discover that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This film could have had a great plot, but the plot is empty of hope. The problem I have with this film is that every ten seconds someone sniffs heroin. If they came out of scenes where someone sniffs heroin, then it would be a very good movie. Whenever I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really bad to have consumed so much drugs in one movie. He drew the attention of the main plot and a beautiful story about a photographer. The lesbian thing did not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
