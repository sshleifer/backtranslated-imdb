I have no idea what idiots gave this film the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was awful! In fact, I watched everything because I could not believe that someone would make such a worthless film. The plot is not interesting, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt to create an atmosphere with music or sound effects. Plus, if you decide to lose 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure to bring something to thrown up, because cinematography is just a person who walks with a camcorder in his hand and half the time that you can not even see the main topics. This style has been used with much more success in such films as "Blair Witch" as it creates a suspense. In Rosetta, there is no conspiracy or suspense that this style would lend anything to. I should have known better when he arrived at 2am that it was going to be horrible.
