Think of a darker version of one of these children's shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this 1990 movie, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and the one who leaves their country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions than those of this series, mainly because they are less colorful. So even if this movie is not good, it is not so bad to watch. There are as I remember two robot battles in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a parcel of land midway when a traitor is revealed, but in the end, the plot is not what will stay with you for an indefinite period after the shot. The fights themselves look like giant toys on unleashing, but are still a little fun to watch. This film would also generate some other movies with similar devices such as giant robots and the tournament. So, it's worth checking once, but probably not more than that.
