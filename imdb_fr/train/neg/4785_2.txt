There are so many things wrong with this unhealthy and unhealthy pet that it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a scary film, even from the point of view of the American. The dialogue is clich√©, the characters are in two dimensions, the writing is great and the little story that there is is neither coherent nor interesting enough. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows, this movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who does not do anything at all heroic), Brave Little Kid (with a series of murderous kills a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more flesh than brains). These guys are arguing with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of nasty little metal spheres that threaten menacing people. When given the opportunity, they perform impromptu brain surgery on those who do not have the mental acuity to avoid the pitfalls when they arise. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but maybe it's a deceptive specter) who seems determined to help our valiant opponents find their kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> There is no character background. or even an introduction to one of the characters. It starts with a sort of recap of the end of the previous movie, but that does not explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, that's fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they are not going to school or work, or why you should worry about whether they live or die. Therefore, you do not do it. The only point of interest becomes the splash effects. And there is not enough to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> The thief's three punks are as interesting as they are fun and they are as stupid as they are nasty and threaten our heroes. But they do not have much time on the screen. They are offered almost immediately. Then they are buried (why anyone should take the time is beyond me), then they appear again as Punk Evil Raider Zombies. Only to be offered again, literally in a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film seems to consist mainly of an appearance and disappearance of Caspar the Benevolent Ghost, looking for places and attempting to score Bad Black Bitch Booty points, using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally handicapped teenager. No dice there; Even a free sex could not save this movie, so what's good is that there never are. <br /> <br /> The villain in chief, called the great man, fails to scare people over 3 years old; screaming "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why he, with his incredible powers of telekinesis and his astonishing strength in the upper body, does not just crush our heroes like insects is not explained. Instead, he delegates the work to his retarded little fools, who never succeed in killing anyone before being shot. <br /> <br /> Spectators who love the masterpieces of the genre "Friday 13th part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to university" find entertainment. The rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will be bored of our skulls.
