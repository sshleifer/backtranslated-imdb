If you like a Syfi soap opera, this show is for you. As far as I'm concerned, it does not work for me. After watching 3 episodes, I can not watch it anymore. It's boring and slow, and for a show, the timeline is based on more than 100,000 years ago if you rely on the battlestar galactica timeline to come to earth, they seem to all have the same material, like the 100-year-old Chevy vans driving the streets and the people who watch the famous brand LCD TVs over 100,000 years old. The same goes for the rest of the series. There are just a lot of things that are involved in the film today not to be neglected. I think they could have done a lot better to solve these problems and yes, battlestar galactica had the same problems, but not so much. As a prize, the rest of the series is not as good as BSG's and it's a poor follow-up to it.
