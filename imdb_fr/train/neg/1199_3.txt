This horror movie is really weak ... if it's the good movie I'm commenting on. Nothing really bad happens when a family adopts a cute little German puppy from Shepard. I had a German Shepherd and he is a very good dog. I did not get the idea to get one of this movie, but rather the comedy "K-9". It's another story all together though. This movie really does not have much horror because the most horrible scene is at the end and it really looks corny. In addition, we see a guy almost putting his hand in a lawn mower. That is just about everything. The father, however, suspects something, because his family seems to become rather strange. Somehow, he discovers that if you hold a mirror while they sleep, you can see if they are possessed. All in all, a really low horror movie, even by television standards ... the TV movies that work are well known, because "This House Possessed" is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie on a woman and those strange creatures that good. This one is really rather dull.
