The king is dead, long life to the king! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, The Family Under the Stairs and Troop Beverly Hills had been linked for so long to the worst movie of all time, so they seemed to be icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... yeah ..... all greet the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, are so bad that they are good. One day, it could make the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" a cult movie. So, go see that ... that ... well, take me at the word. Go see him. Hi new king!
