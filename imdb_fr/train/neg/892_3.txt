(I will indicate in this article the point of departure of the spoilers.) My dissatisfaction is shared: 30% deafness of the tone, 70% dull writing. <br /> <br /> The 30%: I agree with the first commentator's synopsis on the lack of diversity in the characters and the scope of the stories. At best, I was surprised to find that, at best, this film derogates from the reality of New York City by presenting a set of people and relationships so close that it is inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (an author who loves Gossip). Girl). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but they are included by obligation, whereas we can see the gears under the film so clearly, trying to "diversify" but falling very short. <br /> <br /> The 70% is the reason why everything breaks down. All characters, white plus some symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional concepts cut from cardboard. Worse still, their interactions with each other are scripted so that for each vignette of the film, the public is treated as if I call it a "gag": we get a basic concept, then a typing line for to be smart. torsion. But even if we suspended for a moment the cynicism to say: "Okay, it was a surprise" ... the stories are still not so interesting, because they too are superficial. When you create stories so that their existence rests solely on the unexpected end, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The film mainly tries to tell romantic stories. It is very good. But the romance is incredible, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories depict a girl and a boy who share the same place and look at each other. The words are exchanged, the thoughts are projected through the voice-over, but they also manage to make the public understand that one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> This means that there is no seduction (in the broad sense). , no tension, and no confrontation or communion between the wills of two different peoples who are trying to reconcile their existence to welcome the Other. The only story implying a superficial "seduction" is told so that the public ends up being surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawke) is overtaken by the girl to whom it is dragged, which turns out to be an unexpected whore. Of course, it is interesting to hear his words when he tries to take it and we have fun as if we were next to them, but this story has no substance apart from "A then B". So, it unfolds, if something like a postcard could "unfold", with all the other tales too: A then B - That's it, the only point being that they happen "on the set" in Manhattan . By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island drawing; the only queen is the flicker of a train ride made by a character traveling in the West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose a film that respects all common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and soon. New York, I Love You, however, deserves a closer examination because of its title. We expect to see the real New Yorkers and the real New Yorkers, but instead we have paraded before us the chosen slice of a demographic group, its characters imported from the OC, as well as a few others to make it look as if we were paying attention. to diversity. But when you take a closer look at who these characters are, the simulacrum as a whole becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity, ethnicity and culture that the film shamefully fails to represent. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of the film Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who is confused by two ladies with his manny (nanny) while he is the father. Even if the last scene of this part was useless from the point of view of the dramatic construction (it would have been much more interesting to finish it when the mother and her boyfriend / father-in-law are strutting), it is frankly a little disgusting that the scene where we learn with certainty that the girl's father is latino ALSO must also inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, the father can not be just a guy from South America? Now that he is visibly sexy, is the public better prepared to accept that he has had a child with a white middle to upper class woman? Are we so naive to demand such services? As if a Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not for me to say where the film should have gone. But in all imaginable configurations and all the twists and turns, the direction taken shouts status quo, calls for security. All these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we had to keep the unique dimensionality of the characters who lived in them, at least by not choosing among the classic and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown let down by a scruffy old man white? How about an Asian cougar chasing a young white scholar? Again, I'm not saying that all vanity needs to be changed. It's just that all. Damn. premise of the story. is so banal - and so they fail to explain why one might like New York, outside the banal. The real way to improve the movie would be to have written a scenario worth reading. <br /> <br /> I recognize that the soundtrack is pleasant, that the film is well paced (even if what happened was rhythmic, well, drag), and the general feeling of many scenes. The film was perfect, and I would not dissuade anyone from doing it. However, it is telling that the most important tribute to non-superficiality is when the former opera singer says (paraphrasing) "This is what I love in New York: everyone comes from a different place. " Well, you would not know it by looking at this one.
