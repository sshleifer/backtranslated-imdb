I notice that the previous comment (which seems to be still in school) has given this film a very good review and I can only assume that it is because the critic did not see the much better adaptation of 1989 BBC of this classic novel. The major problem I had with this version (1999) was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy in the treble who became known after his participation in the television miniseries "The Choir". I can only assume that he was chosen for the role of Tom Long on the basis of his excellent acting in "The Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" had become a big and divine youth by the time "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed. Anthony could not convince Tom to be a schoolboy. It is too difficult to imagine that Tom (played by Anthony) would be the friend of young Hatty. In the 1989 version of the BBC, Tom and Hatty are much closer together and the development of their friendship is much more believable. For a 1999 film, even the special effects fail to convince and do not constitute any noticeable improvement over the 1989 television effects. The casting and the game of this version are inferior to the previous adaptation and, in the together, the film was a missing version of a classic chandelier. As a last observation, I would like to point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version far exceeds £ 20 whereas a new DVD of this version can be bought for less than £ 5.00, should I say more?
