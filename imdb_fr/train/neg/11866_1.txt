First, this film claimed to have won the "Best Film" award at the "Worldfest" festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> This is not what we call the worst film of all time, but it's really bad, it's as bad as the other Aussie B "Body Melt" levelers, but at least that. the film did not appear to have been shot on the HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I guess the directors have watched a lot of Troma movies and very bad B movies gore, thinking that they too could split into the world of film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love low-quality movies, just the fact that some characters put false American accents, almost as if it would give them more of a chance to sell in the states. or something. Really disappointing, the showdown could have been much more exciting and good fight scenes. You can see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the set, a car explosion, a rocket launcher and countless people shot, while the final lack of humor or "bad" style. taste. "<br /> <br /> If you like to watch very bad gore movies, or if you are interested in making movies without a budget, look at it, otherwise stay away.
