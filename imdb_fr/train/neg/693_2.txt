((NB: Spoiler warning, as is!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a teen movie: the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs says it nicely . If you're looking for Roshambo, it's not that and it will NOT be. I am desperately impressed by the blows to cinematography, directing or acting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it was not Zuniga's first horror movie, it was his first appearance on the screen, in movies, on TV, whatever. For what it's worth; Daphne Zuniga, Susan Sarandon and Katherine Hepburn either. <br /> <br /> Third, you must give even an unfaithful accessory. Of course, she follows the deeply insulting stereotypical message of her kind: any young woman having or showing an interest in sex is an ox on hoof, and the harvest time is now. <br /> <br /> Except that this one gives the boost to the virginal protagonist too! Now, there is a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this has been said the only ingenue movie role. Another wonder, except that this term gives too much credit to the girl. <br /> <br /> (Again, this movie probably has one of the highest percentages of actors having only one movie in history.) Among the 19 actors credited, Thirteen of between them never appeared in another film, three in another film by the same producers, and only one other than Zuniga has up to six credits on the screen What was it? mutual help has been and has never been ??) <Certainly, I saw it a long time ago on a late cable when I was bored and I did not expect to annoy it again in my life, but I see no reason to hunt down all the people involved and throw them in the trash. incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
