My wife and I started watching this movie with anticipation. He looked warm and touching. It started well; but, soon, he became boring and frankly silly. The film was badly played and honesty, we could not really understand or wanted to understand why or how they could support this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acted singing and cleaning. I would have done it. And, of course, like most movies and TV series made in Hollywood, we have to throw him a symbolic "gay" character! This film was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
