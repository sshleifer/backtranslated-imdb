Greenaway seems to have the habit of deliberately trying to disgust his viewers. This film begins with incest - and incestless, meaningless and casual incest. That's the big problem with Greenaway. He prefers salon tours to shock than to do something meaningful. Technical skills are not enough. He's just a little pervert for the evil.
