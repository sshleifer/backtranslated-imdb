And it comes from someone who will support almost ALL viewing. The game and the sound are awful. This could qualify for a point of merit "so bad that it's good," for some. However, I take my horror films seriously and it's just shit - it's so cheap, I think that's my main complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious - be careful how many times you "surprised me" is used. The actress "child" is seriously god. I pray that her acting career ends here. His "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" line, however, deserves to be viewed several times.
