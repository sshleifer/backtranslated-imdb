This film is supposed to be a "light" tale about Santa and his wonders "magical and mystical". But instead, it turns out to be downright scary. The two things in this film that seem to me the most horrible are 1) Santa's style. Have you ever seen a more horrible Santa Claus? and 2) the "bad reputation of Satan". Strange dances are simply disgusting to watch. Watch this movie only if it is the MSTed version or if you like to laugh. I can not believe it's a children's movie.
