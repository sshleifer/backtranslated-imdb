Nowadays, it is a kind of trend to consider all shows of the early 90s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia nowadays), and even if some of these shows were / are without no doubt good, this one is pure shit. I watched the show a lot at the time, because it had a lot of TV rebroadcasts, and even when I was a child, I did not like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how Power Rangers are too active and how special effects have been sucked up even back then. When the series does not resort to painfully painful "fight" scenes, the viewer falls victim to a useless soap opera about a group of teenagers and small social problems from time to time. I do not know about you, but I did not make fun of it all and its filling power until they were forced to "fight" a guy in an extreme clich√© costume with a fire of artifice or toy. -robot. You never feel "involved" in any way in this show, and the fact that most actors act as if there is no interest other than their wallet, only reinforces the lack of feeling . <br /> <br /> There is really nothing memorable in this show, and it is quite surprising that it has had so many benefits (Beetleborgs is a good example). All this is just a quick way to make money. I challenge any "fan" to tell me what exactly stands out in the episodes supposedly so good, because I could not find anything that is even slightly appealing to kids. I guess most "fans" of Power Rangers will tell me I just do not understand, or anything like that. I do not really care; it was shit at the time and it is still so now.
