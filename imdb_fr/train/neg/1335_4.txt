This movie was great !! (Not quite as good as Leif Garrett Longshot's masterpiece) but still awesome !! I thought Ashley looked huge, compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought to move like this and almost get away with it? Dad was a little clever anyway and Mom was a little girlfriend with Helmit Head. I give it to him 4. Everyone who loves this film should see Longshot.
