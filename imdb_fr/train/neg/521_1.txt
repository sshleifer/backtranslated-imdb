Wow! This movie is really awful. I can not imagine how anyone could have read this poorly written script and give it the green light. The distribution is consistently second-rate with truly horrible performances from virtually all players. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. Say it, leaden and predictable. No spirit, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at all. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny that has become increasingly difficult to bear over the film. When your advance (Carrell) is neither funny nor attractive, it goes up from there. In spite of his fake twist where love triumphs over lust, I ended up with a feeling of stomach discomfort. If this is what passes for humor and social comments, we are definitely doomed.
