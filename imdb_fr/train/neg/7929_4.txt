I guess if you like science fiction and horror, it might be interesting. The acting was ok but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty-one years old at a time. The plot is good, but the story jumps a bit, leaving guessing whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed in between. The Catholic Church is described as having a secret sect to investigate events that occur only for those of that faith. What if the two girls were Protestant? Do the Catholics get neat? Therefore, some are artificial. Who knows, one day the Catholic Church could even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, do not feel lost.
