I gave him a 1. There are so many twists and turns that you can never make sure. Total chaos. Everyone is killed or almost. I'm tired of reticles and changing points of view. I can not give the plot. Entangled and crazy. If I had paid to see this, I would claim my money. I would like the critics to be more honest.
