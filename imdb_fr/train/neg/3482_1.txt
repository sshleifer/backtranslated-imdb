So, I know I voted 1 in 10 but it really does not deserve more than half a star. I hated. It was so stupid and unrealistic that I can not believe any of the stars who signed up to make this project ridiculously absurd. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story was nil and I encourage everyone who sees it in the store videos not to bother to take it and read the back cover, but to just get away ... to get into the movie, because it's too stupid to pontificate. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It's horrible! Horrible!
