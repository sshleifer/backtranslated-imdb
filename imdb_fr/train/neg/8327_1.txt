OKAY. So it's a low-budget "film" (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrible, the makeup is laughable (the blood seems to come from Sherwin-Williams and I've already seen more convincing blues made from Halloween ghost kits), and the lighting usually seems to have been used by a Toyota pickup borrowed flagship actors. <br /> <br /> I could perhaps forgive these low-budget features if there was actual content, if a movie was trying to tell a story. But this collection of video footage can not boast of any conspiracy, real character, or momentum. It's a complacent mess. <br /> <br /> And do not worry, no mess here, because there is nothing to ruin.
