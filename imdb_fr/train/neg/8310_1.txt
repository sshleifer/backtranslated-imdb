Another huge conspiracy film that tries to blame the United States government and the armed forces (especially the army) for every disaster since the great flood. Anyone who has ever served in the US military can see how bad this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners are all wrong. (And of course, all senior officers are corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted in recent years. Use every clich√©, rumor and urban legend of the Gulf - everything is presented as a gospel. (In fact, no one really knows why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. The war is NOT fun and I also know veterans of the Second World War, the Korean War and Viet Nam with serious diseases. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of everyone.) Sensational films will not solve the problem!
