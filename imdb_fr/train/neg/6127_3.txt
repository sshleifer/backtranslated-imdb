As I come from Hungary, many people have said better and better about Üvegtigris so far, but in reality I do not understand the reason for all this fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked many points of the film, Some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the stereotyped characters are again present, as in all the Hungarian films, and the story is also quite dull. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the film in its entirety. BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is good as always, Reviczky is brilliant too, but the others are just there. ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years does it take for a good Hungarian movie ???
