I read some comments on the Internet about this movie, such as "... more difficult than the hostel ...", "the camera never screens when it becomes really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera never screens because there is nothing to filter. The same scene is repeated a hundred times. The women are lying on a table, the killer rapes the women several times, the killer cuts the women into pieces (we never see him during the whole movie!). The police came and arrested him. The killer deceives the jury. Movie finished. In Germany, it looks like: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". In the end, one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Absolutely not recommendable.
