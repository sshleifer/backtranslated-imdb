Arg. The dinosaurs lying around are back to take another part of our sanity in this awful third film. This time, European terrorists (the Irish, they say) are hacking a military convoy that is supposed to carry uranium. They enter a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit while the rubber dinos chomp terrorists, cops and some marines. The whole film seems to be (still) largely inspired by Alien (like Carnosaur 2) with the pathetic marines crossing the "claustrophobic" yard? weapons in the hand. This third opus is probably the driest and the most unglamorous film of the lot, with a single shot of blood when a rubber dino tears off the head of a sailor. The dinos are stiff and scrambled creatures, as usual, and the T-Rex sounds like a mad elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the craziest scenes of the film takes place when the copper arrives at the scene: they enter the building where the truck is hijacked and hear a strange noise from another truck. By opening it, surprise! The band of rubber reptiles burst and devours them. Why were the dinos locked in the second truck after escaping from the first? How were they locked up when the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the purpose of filming this scene ???? Oh bother, who cares? Both thumbs down for oversized rubber iguanas.
