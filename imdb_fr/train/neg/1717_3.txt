Here we have two misunderstood children who have never had the slightest chance of opposing a cruel and poverty-stricken existence: Robin Hoods was harassed by the police for being persecuted because he was sometimes a little wild. Gad! According to that shit, Bonnie was the nicest little thing west of Missouri who had been taught to become a psychopathic murderer by a loving boyfriend who did not really want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them. Bad act, mediocre film, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, bloody that looks more like grape jelly than reality. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
