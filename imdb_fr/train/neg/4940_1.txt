This show turned out to be a loss of 30 minutes of valuable space on the hard drive of the DVR. I did not expect much and I actually received less. Not only do I expect the series to be canceled at the end of the second episode, but I can not believe that Geico will again attempt to use the caveman's advertising campaign. I would rather spend a night checking the presence of lice in my daughter's hair than watching this junk. I'm wondering what ABC has conveyed for this show to fit well into the Fall 2007 program, perhaps a reality television show about hospitals, crime and film featuring the AFLAC duck? In case I can not express my opinion on this show, let me be clear and say that it is not very good.
