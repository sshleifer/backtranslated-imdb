With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Whoever would go for it would expect a) either a bad sci-fi movie or b) a comedy mocking bad sci-fi movies. It's supposed to be a mix of both, with a splashed dose of parody. Unfortunately, it falls flat very quickly. <br /> <br /> You're never supposed to take this movie seriously, I realize it, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? I found that only a few of the jokes or situations were fun (for example, side-by-side phone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereals, Superman walking near Lois, etc.). "The killer tomato attack" is trying to be a cult classic, but it does not. A cult classic is a film so different that only a selected group of people understands it (or a similar description). "The killer tomato attack" could please any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor. Therefore, it is not a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is a good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin and sullen journalist, but she has an endearing personality, loves acting too much and is a natural actress. Unfortunately, it is misused here. <br /> <br /> "Attacking Killer Tomatoes" is not as funny as, for example, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but have some hilarious moments, so I would always recommend seeing it once. Avoid the cut of the director, there are interruptions of the producer of the film and so-called sequences "lost" doubled in a supposed African dialect (one can find it in English on the exhausted ribbon).
