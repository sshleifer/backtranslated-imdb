The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are quite acceptable and surprisingly watchable. The characters are credible and interesting. The cloning lab really looks high-tech. After that, everything collapses. The characters begin to behave stupidly, and a new secondary plot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor (supposed to be "nowadays") and become critical, the only justification for the plot being that it is necessary to 't. The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a film so well shot so badly. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This gives rise to strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova called "Bailey Kent" despite her strong accent (and despite it, once, passing inexplicably to * Spanish *!). Due to the decent start, I planned to give this movie the rating 5, but it was really more disappointing than that, so I only gave it 4.
