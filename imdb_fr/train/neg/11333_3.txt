This movie is just shit. Even if the filmmakers claim to be part of this culture, this director's debut remains very, very bad. The subject itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting of the actors because they are all amateurs and they have never played before, but the worst aspect of this film are the dialogues and the setting scene very inexperienced and naive. There is no timing at all in this movie. I felt that the filmmakers were so excited about making this movie (it's their first feature film), that they never really wondered what story they wanted to tell. I've met Ben (one of the directors) a few times and he's a kind and caring guy, but that does not make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but still manages to convey a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, does not say anything new or provocative and (it's sad about this film), it is far from everything Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see strange but interesting German films, watch the movies of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny Funny's video Games Die Unberührba. <br /> <br /> *** out of ten, because of the subject and photography
