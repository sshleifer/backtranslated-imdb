When I was a child, we always kept babysitting, and we always rented a movie or saw a movie in the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. It's one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen, I think it could even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A Martian is dropped on the ground, turns into a human, befriends a human and tries everything to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only positive comment I can make is the choice of actors: Christopher Lloyd of Back to the Future, Martney, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Jeff Daniels of Dumber, Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley, Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah, Lizzie. But other than that, it's complete shit. Poor!
