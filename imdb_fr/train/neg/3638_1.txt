The film depicts the unresolved issues of France with its colonial heritage in West Africa (Francophone) through the confused and complex prism of a young woman, France (symbolically representing her nation). It is an often engaging and stimulating portrait of a young woman's desire to cope with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and the desire of one nation to reach out to the "other" has already "owned" and modeled. This is reflected in the way it is entirely centered on the notion of travel (or transit) from the present to the past; Memories of realities with undeniable contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> The characters all play a symbolic role, although limited and unconvincing. France, supposed to be both a visual representation and a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves indifference to her fate, because she always seems to be imbued with the same naivete which she enjoyed as a child, she seems more possessed of its reality. The rest of the whole Rag-Tag is just to forget. Black Africans are, at the very least, offensive impressionist portraits of former colonized peoples now colonized by the director's mismanagement of the material. It is nothing more than a dark and moribund background against which Blytheian France is amazed to look for a world she has never known and hoping for a world never found in Cameroon.
