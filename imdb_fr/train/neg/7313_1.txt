I lost 5.75 to see this shitty movie so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of splitting the dog in half at the beginning of the movie, the sickness had nothing to do with being split in two. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of dragging Karen into the shed, she had already totally infected her room, they could have locked her in a place where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why would the hermit run in the forest asking foreigners to help him when he could have asked his relative, the swine lady, to take him to the hospital ? <br /> <br /> Why does he not have any of the characters do not bother to go to town for help when the situation starts to go wrong, is he really as lazy as this one? <br /> <br /> Even though Paul was threatened by the guy with the shotgun for taking a look Paul, his wife, could have sent Jeff or Bert home to ask for help. the girl he loves is getting worse. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left, when everyone was infected, if He was so stupid to leave, would not he have gone home? ? <br /> <br /> If the police tried to gather the children and burn them on the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it was not even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> bugs in it. Why could not the two children have been using tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid end would still work.
