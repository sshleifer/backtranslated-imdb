This film is a travesty, and is not worthy of staying in the company of the original superior. The plot is an absolute mess and the movie is way too long. Every time they struggle, they desperately insert a sentimental reminder of the first film. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the 10 best British movies of all time, this one is awful.
