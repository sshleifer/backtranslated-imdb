I must say it's a horrible movie, for the simple fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it's listed as a documentary. As I watched him, I started laughing, thinking about myself, does this guy really expect me to think it's true? So I had to check and I know now that it's a movie, but now, as it's not a documentary, it's now a movie with bad acting. So, anyway, it's pretty bad. In fact, I did not reach the end. I had to turn it off. I'm a New York police officer, and I got the impression that someone was trying to deceive people into thinking it was a documentary, with the intention of earning money after a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it's not as bad as I think personally. Everyone has their own opinion.
