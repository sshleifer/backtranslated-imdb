Adapted from Stephen King (scripted by King himself) in which a newly arrived family from rural Maine discovers the pet cemetery near their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then discovers the Mi'kmaq burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has resurrection powers - it is obvious that everything that is buried does not return exactly to the right. <br /> <br /> Medium "horror" photo starts awkward, insulting and inept, and continues well for a while, with the worst absolute element being the worthless performance of Midkiff. It's a little better towards the end, with a really disturbing finale. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why I can not reject it completely - at least, it has SOMETHING to make it memorable. Fred Gwynne, the wise old neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, the disfigured spirit, Victor Pascow, are not enough to buy a movie. <br /> <br /> King looks like a minister. <followed by a sequel also performed by Mary Lambert (is not it surprising that she has not had a mainstream movie since?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
