First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be up in a vampire movie. With the other less interesting characters and the poor story, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you keep this in mind and you are a big fan of vampire cinema, you can have fun with a few scenes. Do not expect Tarantino-style chapters here or a story by Anne Rice. (I expect to have forgotten all the movie by tomorrow;)
