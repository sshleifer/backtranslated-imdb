This movie was a little confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one is a bad choice, just as she does the movie Ring Around the Rosie, which does not make good movies either. Jeepers Creepers was much better. In any case, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally scared me and in the end it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) attending the burial of her twin sisters. She stays in a house owned by her sister and grandmother (Dunaway) who lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationship a little to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, what she tries. Crows have a strange role. When parents go to bed, the crows eat their organs, so they can not sleep. But they do it. Basically, it's crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her parents will be buried, but not dead, because they must suffer forever for Mary Ellen to stay alive. Yes, I hope it helps. If not, sorry. I love you.
