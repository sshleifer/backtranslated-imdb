I'm sorry, I had a lot of hope for this film. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was actually about an old man reliving his dream, I felt cheated. It surely could have been a way to get us to something deeper, more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a big glass, otherwise you run to the bathroom. My children did not like it either. Well.
