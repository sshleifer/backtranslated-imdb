There is no reason I understand why this movie was ever shot. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to produce a horrible update from one classic to the next? (Examples: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - Terrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I appreciate normally, was so sadly wrong in this role. His manic description of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so incredible that it's almost impossible to be criminal. His ranting words, moans, grimaces, and humor give us no reason to take care of his character, except a one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that quick movements, screaming dialogues "slapstick had some similarities with comedy." Apparently, he told ALL ACTORS to act as if they had red ants in their trousers. <br /> <br /> The fault must fall on the irresponsible scenario.I think the writer used "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good storyline. comedy, as maniacal as this classic of 1963 is, it is far superior to this trap - in fact - suddenly, it is rather pretty in comparison. <br /> <br /> What is the saddest about of this film is that it must have apparently been written appealing to young children.I am not sure of who the children are intended.I certainly do not know any child card holder who respects ! <br /> <br /> If they had to redo "My favorite martian", why did not they add the timeless charm of the c lassique original? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not give readers a rating of "zero", it's the only note that comes to mind to describe this tragedy. <br /> <br /> A good This film has arrived, the actors and the team have been paid - I think.
