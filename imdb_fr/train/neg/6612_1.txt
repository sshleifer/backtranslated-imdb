I downloaded this movie yesterday on a website. The quality was pretty good! I watched the film with high expectations (although I knew it was a failure), especially because the film embodied superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to convince the villain that this proves that no one can compete with the magical lawsuit of AMJAD KHAN Rgv to royally revive the past! Sholay, the former is a landmark event in Indian cinema with a cast of stars, a cult dialogue, an elegant cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack, still popular with current generations. A good actor like TALENTS ARE, Ajay Devgan way. Passing Raj, a newcomer does not know what it's like to play. Nisha Kothari proved she was one of our worst actresses. I do not know how she is still in the RGV team. Urmila & Abhishek were seen in a song without excitement or passion. Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen's work was good. work in this movie It was a total carnage of the original Sholay
