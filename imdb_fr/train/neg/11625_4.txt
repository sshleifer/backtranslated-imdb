With the exception of Brady Variety Hour, it was the craziest TV I've ever seen. The video production qualities were not so bad, but the overall appearance was unequivocal in the early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought the lady Avon ... and lost a lot of time. MUCH too much eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was quite embarrassing to see veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid participate. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African pavilion in World Showcase, which would open 'in about a year'. (Unless you're counting on Disney's animal kingdom.) Still, despite all its shortcomings, it's still an interesting visual element of Disney's story.
