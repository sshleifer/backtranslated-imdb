After watching this film, I was frankly disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the realization - I was disappointed by the commercials of this film. <br /> <br /> The trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third way" apart from surrender or die (Polish news has even misunderstood that they had the choice to be killed by their own artillery or by German canons, they even misrepresented the title as "misplaced battalion"). This is the good opportunity and I bought the film. <br /> <br /> The disappointment began when I realized that the third way is to sit down and count the corpses, then sit down and count the corpses ... Then I I started thinking, "Hey, this story can not be so simple ... I bet this smart officer will find a clever way to save what's left of his troops." Well, he did not, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And me too. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real events from the First World War. The writers could not use their imagination, but even thought that I found this film really indisputable and even a bit boring. And as I wrote at the beginning - it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketing managers have raised expectations well above the level at which this film could cope.
