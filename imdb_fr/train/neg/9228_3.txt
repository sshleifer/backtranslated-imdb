CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows a young filmmaker who makes a very Barbarella film. After that, the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The film "Dragonfly" made in QC poses the problem of not ending. This is very similar to CQ, which also lacks an end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky to attend the screening of this film at the SxSW festival. I had quite high expectations after watching Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy film. If you do not like science fiction from the 60s or slow movies that go nowhere, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ looks like a student movie. If you want an independent movie recently rented by Donnie Darko, it will not make you sleepy.
