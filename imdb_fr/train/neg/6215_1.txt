It was really a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes ... even if the animation is of superior quality. <br /> <br /> Once the film started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, saying that it might become interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot was played over and over again, but what got worse was that the main hole in the plot was all the story about how to kill the bad guys ... The writer could have done so much more with the whole concept, but seemed like he or she did not have the heart to the skin and wanted to close the film from the beginning. <br /> <br /> All in all, too much hype but not able to deliver.
