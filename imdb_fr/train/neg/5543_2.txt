Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity, but I only watched it for the first time last night and it easily slipped into the last five of my story. Was it supposed to be about love story or zombies ??? This film was so bad that after putting an end to his mercy, all I could do was laugh at the ridiculous. Fortunately, I'm too anal to turn off a film without seeing everything or I could not boast of watching all this in one sitting! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so, according to this theory, I will recognize the most positive asset of this film: it was very short for a feature film.
