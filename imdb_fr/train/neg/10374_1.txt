A family settles in an old house in Japan. But there is a trap that it's haunted (BOO !!!). Aw, I did not want to blow you up. It's only a magazine. Come back. Ahem, now anyway, he's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and lover in slow motion. This naturally makes a scene of 3 minutes at about 7 or 8. Act horrible. Horrible story. But how much can this be asked? Well, it was a pity that my brain had started to melt and run through my nose in thoughtful drops. It was so bad every time that Doug McClure appeared on the screen, I prayed for flashbacks from Small Wonder (Yes, I know that Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "small Wonder", but is about the same show, and I can hum the "little wonder" theme better) There are movies that are so bad that they are good. it's not one of those <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My rating: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy : Mako Hattori becomes topless, Susan George gets 2 scenes of love (a naked, a just topless) <br /> <br />
