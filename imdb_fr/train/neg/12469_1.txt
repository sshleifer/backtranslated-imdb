It is rare that I abandon a film without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rented it on DVD. Syriana was one of those I abandoned. Midway through, I turned it off, disgusted. <br /> <br /> This film is disjointed, boring, confusing and dull. The acting was dry and without credible representations. The general plot was good but developed in such a tasteless and boring way that it failed to capture my attention or interest. Multiple subplots often failed to connect to each other and looked more like random stories than connected conspiracy. Too bad that such a serious subject and such big players could create such a failure. I can not imagine that this film receives an appointment, let alone a prize.
