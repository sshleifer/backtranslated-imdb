The disappearance concerns a couple who take their family on vacation to New Mexico and find themselves in a difficult situation after making a detour on the main road to visit a city apparently abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. The town of Weaver seems innocuous at first and attracts tourists until the family finds itself stuck overnight and begins to have good reason to suspect that other people have experienced the same fate with fatal consequences. The Henley watch the Blair-Witch-Project-Esquire video diary left by the latest victim in the city, which ironically shows the best performance of anyone in this film. Although the performances of Hamlin and Dey are much better than those of the previous actors, their emotional impact seems to me "flat" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The disappearance is attractive for most of the film because there is a lot of suspense and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and unexpected turns that seemingly make no sense. Even worse, there is really no understanding of exactly what is happening in the film, making the bizarre ending less tolerable. It seemed to me that filmmakers were so focused on creating a series of suspenseful scenes that they threw out all the elements of a good script: intrigues development, progressive explanation of themes and symbols leading to a coherent solution / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the film was spending the first three quarters to create tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot, which were later eliminated as if we did not do it. t deserves an explanation: <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to the original people of Weaver? What was the connection with people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover if there is anything? <br /> <br /> It was, I think, a bad move, because it generated a certain resentment. I had invested a great deal in thinking about the hypothesis of plausible explanations of some of these twists of intrigue and these strange events, only for the filmmakers to put an end to it without giving any answer to any of them. these things. Here are some beautiful cliffhangers for the end of a mini-series that is about to resume next week, but a completely frustrating and inappropriate end to an independent film.
