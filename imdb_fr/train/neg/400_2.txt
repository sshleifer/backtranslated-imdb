I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured watching this movie. It's so stupid and improbable both in the general story and in the details that you simply can not suspend disbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher making a new Porsche and dine with his team in a castle-like restaurant, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. What kind of life with a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing the good guys, this last group acts so stupidly that you want them to die in order to clean the gene pool. The special effects are quite good - any producer can buy that money - and the main actors have been great in other films, but the script and the staging here are stupid. Many people have wondered if there was a deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous seemingly stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop. It's just bad.
