It started with an interesting premise. I still like the stuff of civil war and the old secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that it was at best a B movie. In the second half, it quickly became a movie C, then D, then F, then "I wish it was not not a rental to put it in the microwave! " I can not say that playing in any case was awful, but more often than not. Writing, though ... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The scenario was written by a 10 year old child. It was ridiculously shallow, the dialogue dull and uninteresting, the characters as interesting as a 5-pound fertilizer bag. I really hated this movie, just like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This film did a disservice to the cause. Horrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
