The Sentinel is all about the lack of soul in Hollywood and the overwhelming lack of imagination in so many movies nowadays. I absolutely can not think of a good thing about it. Everything is so generic, so factory-made and so lazy that in reality there are only informative ads on how to make money with an unsuspecting and unserved audience. <br /> <br /> A conspiracy on a secret service agent planning to assassinate the Prez could be entertaining. If this is managed by a good director or a caring cast. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the first lady with whom he has an affair (an undeveloped and unsolved plot). Sutherland is the best friend who believes in his guilt because there would be no movie if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a Maybelline fortune and ... that's all. I guess there are fewer requirements for women entering the secret service. As usual in a film like this, the role of the Prez itself is just a tool, a pledge, and it is very badly written. <br /> <br /> That of Clark Johnson, the one who made us the equally pathetic SWAT 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap television movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone from afar to interpret their performances. Eva Longoria, the most overexposed woman of the 21st century, is basically only for the purpose of attracting the audience of Desperate Housewives. Her role is 100% useless and she does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or contribute to the development of the character. It has barely 2 lines to mix with. A really shameless marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> If you are a punishment maniac, do not let me stop you. But it's time and money you will not get back.
