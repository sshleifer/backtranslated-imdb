Friday the 13th not crossed! There is officially a movie worse than your hate series. I won this film in a university competition and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones is a really horrible singer trying to find murderers or something. At least Friday the thirteenth never bothered me. I would rather have my fingernails fired than seen again.
