First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What's this mess? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low-budget shit on TV late at night with the promise of disturbing and insulting garbage that any normal human being with a soul could not watch. <br /> <br /> What shit is funny when a dog is hurt, a grandmother falls off her head ... a guy blew his hand and two girls go to the room bath? what the hell of this world has come that people find comedy in something so completely sick. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear, it's not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of waste ... and they can not not even remove that.
