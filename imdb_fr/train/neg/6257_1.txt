SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this film. Let me add balance by pointing out the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. While Tom and Dan "know each other", mocking movies, the speech is clearly that of a person, and I guess it's the director, who has carefully worked his words so that they look smart . At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard about HIV?" and it seems as natural as asking, "Have you communicated with the nine extraterrestrial races?" <br /> <br /> Acting: the white teeth and the chiseled face do not make a sensitive artist. I guess Speedman did pretty well what we gave him, but Marsden was terrible - unfriendly, unbelievable, and totally smiling and smiling throughout his captivity. Its performance is empty (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: save me! The moments of half-escape were not exciting but irritating and weak. Remember that Marsden claimed to try keys in the door and then throw them away: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee. And beware of semi-black and white flashbacks, which are triggered by some schlocky sounds drawn from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, perverse and offensive, is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have removed the condom or not used it at all - forgive me, where was Tom during sex? The insertion partner is naughty, it is kind of naughty homosexual men. <br /> <br /> In summary: pay attention!
