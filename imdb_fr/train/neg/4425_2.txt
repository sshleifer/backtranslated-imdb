A film about the Harlem Renaissance and a particular author. This contrasts with the modern history of a young gay and black artist. <br /> <br /> If it seems vague, it's because the film itself is. It is well run, well written and (for the most part) well done. Scenes from the past are also shot in black and white. It is also one of the few films dealing with homosexual men NOT to avoid sex scenes (not so explicit and not frontal). Still, I hated it above all else. <br /> <br /> The film winds in all directions, abounds with unimaginable characters (including the main protagonist) and (it's the killer) advances at a snail's pace. Three times, I considered leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> The post-speech of his speech shows that it was a work of love that lasted 6 years. I really wish I liked it more (VERY few honestly gay movies), but I can not. Unless the Harlem Renaissance is of great interest to you, there is no reason to see it.
