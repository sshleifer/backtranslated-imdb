I really wanted to love this movie, but I was bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera stream of a robot heading towards a bomb and is naturally fragile. But then, the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during the quiet moments of conversation, to the point of being ridiculous. Are rental houses short of tripods and steadicams? The fact that it was shot in 16mm format does not help, because the entire film is as gritty as it is fragile. <br /> <br /> Despite all of Bigelow's efforts to create accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring mistakes and inconsistencies that undermine the film's credibility. <br /> <br /> - A car would not be ravaged by flames after a single blow, and once engulfed, it would not be extinguished by a small hand fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would be assisted by other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit an insurgent running long distance, where the ball clearly takes a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs were brought into designated disposal areas on or near a base, not somewhere in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The tanker attack was reported to have taken place in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that suffered very few attacks from the inside. The area is mainly composed of offices and palaces with few residences, but it is described as a dangerous maze of dark alleys and insurgents. Strangely, James is never bothered by the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to take an alley each by themselves, thus preparing the kidnapping attempt. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of which, the three-person team is still represented cleaning buildings, chasing insurgents, etc., even though there are obviously dozens of soldiers . <br /> <br /> - How many hours does he have to wait for a dead insurgent hanging from a window to realize he is not pretending? <br /> <br /> There was no successful staging to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation to this one. I did not know who the EOD team reported on and no other characters were mentioned. These are things the characters would know, so we should too. <br /> <br /> Most "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the colonel psychiatrist will have problems with the Iraqis he is trying to move, that the choice of cereals at home will be difficult and that a driver you have removed will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle . Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a difficult relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the problem? <br /> <br /> If it's really the best of Iraqi war movies to date, it's a shame. Based on the half hour I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO.
