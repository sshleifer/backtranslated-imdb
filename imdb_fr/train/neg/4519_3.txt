Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to be performed by the Stooges and it's really not that great. This makes the THREE STOOGES look like a DAZE (from 1963) to a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are concierges in a place suitable for rockets. They climb into a rocket that goes to Venus. There they meet objects, including a talking unicorn they call "Kingdom", that they bring back to Earth with them. "Uni" speaks like a nice and average person - "Oh, hello, how are you, nice planet here, I hope you like it." Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes follow one another. <br /> <br /> The Stooges come back from space and the film ends as far as the story tells, but nobody said that to the filmmakers, because the photo lasts about 10 minutes at a party where nothing happens.The Stooges leave the party and the film is almost over. <br /> <br /> The the highlight of the film - the end when the Stooges are singing a dapper little song on their journey Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned the beautiful musical score The only music I even noticed was two classic tunes - ILL TAKE ROMANTH and there's one more song, both of which are played at the party, and * it's * really the highlight of the picture - the music of old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The big sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only store.
