"It must have been you" is another sign that Hollywood lacks ideas. This photo is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer turned author. When Charlie's fianc√© leaves the city, he is taken with all the wedding planning. He spends a week in a classy hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who is also getting married. The two friends quickly become friends and decide to plan together their wedding. This is when the plot becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life and Charlie. This film snatches all the romantic comedies ever made and lets you wait for the end of the film to be able to do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really poor performances, making this film all the more heartbreaking to watch.
