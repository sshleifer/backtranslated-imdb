The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately, it broke up because of a weak / implausible scenario, a misinterpretation of the film and a general lack of content / substance. One of the most obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, could not pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem like a small flaw, but it indicates the apparent lack of effort to pay attention to details. The game quality was consistently well below average. <br /> <br /> The solitary saving grace of the film was the twist of intrigue at the very end; and a French song (I do not remember the title). All in all, it was a very bad movie in which Sean Connery was obviously a bad message.
