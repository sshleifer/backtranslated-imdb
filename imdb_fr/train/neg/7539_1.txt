Where to begin to describe the global misery of Neil LaBute's last filming attempt? <br /> <br /> There are many types of moviegoers, but by far the intriguing and the less profound, it's Mr. Intriguant. You know Mr. Intriguant, do not you? <br /> <br /> This is the guy that the movie is stupid, lame and incredibly boring, he says, "Good God, I do not know why everyone hated him, I found it intriguing . " This is the kind of guy who finds the smell of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he rubs it in the shape of a Hitlerian mustache on the upper lip and scrolls past the house shouting on the brilliance of science fiction that includes references thinly veiled to Greek mythology. He is also the guy for whom this version of The Wicker Man was made. No one else could stand it.
