Randolph Scott leaves the United States for the greener lands of British Columbia. He wants to open a breeding with his partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They push their little flock on a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later, Jory shakes his cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the crash. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, the year of his retirement, Randolph Scott created a series of good westerns on the theme of adults, some considered as classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo Trail will never be one of his best Westerns. <br /> <br /> This looks more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. The story is downright stupid. Williams, who was with Scott, wanted to make gold because there was a big shot at the time. He does not blame the robbers, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie where Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule has learned to kick the order and chase the Indians, allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure it would have played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, history has it that you believe that Tyro's prospector, Randolph Scott, accidentally falls on a gold strike after a few prospector's lessons, Gabby Hayes. on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> It was the starting film part of Gabby Hayes' Farewell. It would have been better if he had come out in a good western and in fact, he had made two or three best with Randolph Scott before that. <br /> <br /> I will say this, although no caribou appeared in the film, it is one of the few Canadian films in the region not to have a mounted police. <br /> <br /> But if I were yourself, unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, make the next detour via Cariboo Trail.
