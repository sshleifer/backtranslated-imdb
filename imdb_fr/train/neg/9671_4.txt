I would give maybe 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film is successful. If there are people who look at this article and think that "good, then the Jews must have done something to be treated as they were during the Second World War", then the film is very well done to to conceal "why and how" and how to mix correctly and false observations on the life of a people. What can a propaganda film do? The part in which is included an American film on the Rothschild family is for example very well reused here. There is never the question of why the Jew keeps his fortune to the officer. Nobody mentions the taxation system within this particular social layer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or level of disgust) in the film slowly increases and the end of the film as a solution the purpose and need to make propaganda. The public would leave with joy and gratitude the times that are coming ... well played. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that responds to the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The film is a kind of story today, so you do not need to do much. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, an attentive observer can find a link with cultural hatred, violence, decivilization as well as current integration problems. Overall, good trash.
