Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone ever seen anyone sneak into an open field? Well, this happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the director's favorite scaring tactics). In one of the opening scenes, the producer who speaks good / hot must sit at the back so that the cameraman can sit in front to film. Shortly after his arrival on the field, the 5 competitors come forward and, although it is clearly at least 2 o'clock in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun was going down for a minute. other. After about 30 minutes of baskets without drink, we are privileged with a look back at the history of the clown in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this film, take a look at the women's chest ... her ribs go up to the neck, it was disgusting. Most horror movies take place during the night, but without a night vision camera, chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that made their appearance in the film give the impression that they were stolen in the Blair Witch project or in clich√©s taken at random in the director's backyard. The film was a little redeemed in the end when there was a matrix like a shooting with the clown that we rewound and watched again and again and laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie certainly if you've ever been a fool IN AN OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, THE RESPONSE
