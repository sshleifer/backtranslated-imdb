His first film after the death of his long-time friend, John Belushi, Aykroyd is very tired trying to create a character that would have been a great success for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Dr. Detroit" gives us the book teacher Aykroyd posing as a strange and violent pimp to ward off a rival known as Mom. It's bad enough, but it also has lessons to give, a dinner at school, four ladies at night to protect and a pimp dinner (or something like that). No wonder Aykroyd seems stunned most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It is on this film that Aykroyd met the future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good results came out of this chaos. <br /> <br /> A star and a half. You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want trouble, see "Dr. Detroit".
