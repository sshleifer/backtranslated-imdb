You know that a movie will not do well when John Carradine tells (in reading, the script and the synopsis of the plot) the funeral procession of his character, barely 5 minutes after the beginning of the film. Narration is the last will of his character. He stipulates that his estate be divided into four children and servants. The children will share $ 136 million in equal shares, but if they die, this share is shared among the others. If all the children die, it is divided between the servants. To be eligible, they must live in the family domain for one week. This looks like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> The nature of the deans is not very valuable. They are a powerful family and seriously dysfunctional, but the real problem starts with the drowning of this dog. From the first voice of John Carradine, you expect this film to lead to a Machiavellian game of cat and mouse with an end. <br /> <br /> This trip is painfully slow and useless. We spend minutes watching people sitting, playing billiards, throwing darts, misusing the plan "through the fishbowl", dramatic conversations between men dressed in silk ties, constant bickering, lost circus music, strange flashbacks reminiscent of false Germans. Expressionism, the horror aesthetic of Grade 4 and heaps of overactive drama. All of this inevitably leads to the expected and unrewarding end. You will be happy to be alive, but the pain may be too much to bear alone. Share children, share. <br /> <br /> -Chabuloidal
