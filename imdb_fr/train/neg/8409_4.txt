Eddie Murphy for Best Actor in a Supporting Role ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who knows how to play) goes through this film like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? It was acting ??? <br /> <br /> This film is ridiculous compared to CHICAGO or any other recent musical comedy. <br /> <br /> If Jennifer Hudson had not sung and performed, I would have given ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I've never seen the play, so I do not do typical Broadway vs. Hollywood rap.
