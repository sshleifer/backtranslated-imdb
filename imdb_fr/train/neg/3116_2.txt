Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film remains true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I had to go through a film, it was: <br /> <br /> Director <en /> <br /> Director of photography < <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> CAN NOT miss the damn boom of the microphone that emerges from the film almost every chapter of the film, how can I have fun and concentrate on the film? history and believe in the sacred thing when I remember the technical details of making a movie !!!!!!! <br /> WAIT DVD OR DO NOT NEED
