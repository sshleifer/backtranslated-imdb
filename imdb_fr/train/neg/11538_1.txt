A really horrible movie that left me feeling defiled by watching the forty minutes or I could stand up. It's not the actors' fault, but the screenwriter / director, the producers, the financiers, etc., need to speak very hard. Maybe he thinks it's deep. It's not. This rape and ultra-violence, contrary to what is at the heart of Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. Nor is it a straw dog I have already compared. It sounds like something that Pete Walker could have done, but even saying that I'm probably a bit unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Vengeance is a powerful human desire, but The Window Window has more to say about it and male emasculation than this deplorable effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's particularly misogynistic, but just too happy in its description of some of the details - the blood flowing down GA's leg after the rape, for example. This is neither a challenge nor a confrontation, although I am certain that filmmakers consider themselves "daring", just deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can aim? Is that why the people involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote here the Latin phrase which translates to Oh the time! Oh the customs! But the new spell checker on IMDb did not let me publish before I deleted it. Also, I had to delete the square brackets sorted IMDb.) <br /> <br /> Where is the noble aspiration? The noble impulse? When you watch a British movie - the happy comedies of Ealing or Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime Third Man (a movie that has a lot more to say about evil than a thousand of mine); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation, check out Sidney Lumet's "The Offense", an original play by John Hopkins, and search for "Tunes of Glory" for something worthwhile. to be created. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the foregoing, Straightheads is, alas, a totally odious waste of celluloid.
