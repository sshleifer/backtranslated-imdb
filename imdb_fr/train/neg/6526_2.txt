Desperately inept and dull film in which the characters stand in rooms or in a rocket and talk endlessly. You may think things would get better as they explore Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a thick red / orange filter that makes everything very cloudy. The landscape / vegetation Martian is mainly made of drawings and the monsters are absolutely not convincing. There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine delicately wraps the octopus like a tentacle of a flesh-eating plant around her before struggling weakly, with the difference that the movie Ed Wood is a hundred times more entertaining. Better to wear earplugs when watching, otherwise the music score "science fiction", repeated endlessly, will drive you crazy. If you are unable to sleep one night, simply slide it into the VCR and your insomnia will be healed in no time.
