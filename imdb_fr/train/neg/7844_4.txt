Nobody goes in a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the next coming of Citizen Kane. The same goes for the majority of low-rent horror movies, especially those that Roger Ebert nicknamed "Teen Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 is definitely qualified as a dead teen movie, except that here teenagers have received the superficial appearance of military trainees. <br /> <br /> Some would say it's not a movie, "but dubious facts are high in a film review, but I've always been firmly convinced that any good fantasy must be rooted in reality To be effective In Hills Have Eyes 2, we must believe that the main characters are soldiers in training, but they look and speak like high school students camping in the desert.The dialogue is awful and often vulgar to excess. the films are not nearly comparable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" were part of the pack and trembling with fear. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than guns and fatigue: radio transmissions are carried out like teenage telephone conversations, a colonel is addressed as "hey, asshole" by a soldier, and no one seems to have any idea of ​​what to do, or any sense of the s command structure, when things start to go wrong. I think of James Cameron's Aliens soldiers, a pure fantasy film, and how even these futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. A fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to watch a film in the form of a 5 on a scale of 10 and judge its strengths and weaknesses. You must authorize concessions for the equipment; there is no chance that Star Wars is as good a movie as The Godfather, tied. But both are excellent examples of this type. <br /> <br /> In this respect, while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is an awful exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is only modestly worse in this respect than the typical Dead Teenager. Movie. On the technical side, the film seems to have decent production values ​​and is quite well done from this point of view. Scenes intended to shock or evoke urgency or suspense usually work. So while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may actually be a worse fate than death, there are certainly some of the worst horror movies in circulation. <br /> <br /> It's worth being watched by those who love this stuff without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who do not tend to think that every movie they see is the best or the worst of all time. If you do not have "horror", especially the Dead Teenager variety, you probably will not have a good time with this one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
