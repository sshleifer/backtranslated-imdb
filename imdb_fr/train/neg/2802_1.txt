I think if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the English script to create a script, it would make more sense than that. I could then go to the first year drama group and they would play it better than the pranks of this movie. It sounds really mean, but I'm sure they did it like a joke and are quite aware that they do not own (see what I did there?) Nor the skills to play or write anything it would be. /> Watch this only if you are drunk, high or need a good excuse for why your rotting corpse has been found with split wrists. I will now go to my fishbowl and pick up all the poo at the bottom. After that, I will cast it in the form of a disc and put it in my DVD player, hoping it will produce something much better than this trumpet. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 tits - 9/10
