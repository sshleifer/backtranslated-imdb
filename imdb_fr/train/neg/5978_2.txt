This third movie on Pokemon is too abstract for young children and too repetitive to entertain the older ones. The movie's message - about the loss - is subverted by the return of the girl's father during the film's credits. The Team Rocket gets some fun, but they are not really part of the little plot, so they do not appear very often.
