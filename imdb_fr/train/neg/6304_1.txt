As a naval history buff in the Second World War and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations, I was eager to see this film. What a piece of disappointing schlock. I did it about three-quarters of the way, but I should have put it out on the scene of the secondary attack. The idea that a U-boat could fire a torpedo on a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then be able to "flee" the DDE when submerged, is absurd. And this is only a small detail. The whole film was poorly written, badly directed and badly played. I agree with the other members of the board that it could have been a good movie. It's as if they had decided that since all these rotten propaganda films of the Second World War were made with entirely white castes, they had to make one with the blacks. And as bad as these old movies are, it's actually worse. And it almost looks like misleading advertising for the titles Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they had very minor roles. I must believe that these two good actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I'm finished. I gave too much of my life to this shitty movie.
