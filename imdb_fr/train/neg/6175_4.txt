Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover of the video library? No. Was it a "thought food" since the author might have been trying to prepare it? Not really. So what was it? It was a very average film, which had great potential, and which was well done, but left behind by a puzzling story without strengths, starting in the middle and at the end, with a mediocre actor waiting for the killer guy in series which, although it seemed too zealous at times delivered the best performance of the overall distribution. It was a beautiful cinematography, with good colors, nice high tech elements, beautiful landscapes, but leaves you lost where he is going and where he has just been. And with the feeling that we are going to finish quickly. OK to watch if there is nothing else on TV.
