A case study murdering students, a new teacher can stop the madness ?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not care. <br /> <br /> With a title like Splatter University, we would immediately rest assured that this film is simply not great art. But worse than that, Splatter University does not even qualify for fun trash. Splatter U is so badly done - the story is stupid, the characters are disposable and the entire movie lacks imaginary essence. Needless to say, there is no suspense, no atmosphere, no fear. This motricity is not even brave enough to indulge in the slightest nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). So, all around this constantly failing slasher offers nothing in terms of entertainment (not even cheap laughter) and just gets boring. In the bottom of the barrel - even the most diligent fans of slasher will want to think twice before watching, not to mention the price to pay for this film. <br /> <br /> BOMB in ****
