Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson realizes and respectfully takes the little book of the same name on a big screen in a feature film. Although I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, did, the movie seemed to have gone astray in its evil spirit. Anderson seems to have forgotten the story knowing that he is a talented man and if it was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have a bad day, it's Anderson's first bad day in making movies, so I'll let him go easily. I will admit that his skill and wit were clever and that the animation is nice, but the film becomes more and more difficult to integrate, abandoning the story and causing random scenes. The characters are good too. Jason Schwartzman expresses the intelligent son of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash, and particularly engaging. The film fails to reach an incredible level of terror, but it gets closer as you move forward. I'm sure Wes Anderson will find another great movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, your film was a big disappointment.
