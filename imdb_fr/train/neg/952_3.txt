Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for everyone, including the public. The lightness of the mistaken identity of the old hat and the intrigues of false scandals is eminently forgivable. Very few people have watched these films for their intrigues. But, they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in the subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreography, a breathtaking dance and catchy songs. Not happy go beautiful. And Vera-Ellen as a female director played the whole movie as the second banana, desperate for a star to play it - and instead she was invited to wear the film and could not do it. . The Scottish region has been wasted. Usually, Scottish fantasy is automatically ubiquitous. The photography was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, upsetting the landscape since no one else did his part, in the type of producer role frequently described by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and no one could do David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven like me, that's enough reason to lose 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
