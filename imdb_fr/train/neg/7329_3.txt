After watching this film, I felt the urge to evacuate some of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous actress and currently underrated. Max Beesley was rather charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, while not really original, was certainly promising. None of that counted, however ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what his contract is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. It slowed down footage, accelerated, inverted, used bulky camera angles, used annoying color filters, performed quick cuts, zintion in the timeline and completed it all with an uncomfortable "modern" soundtrack composed of brilliant sounds. . I do not remember the last time I saw such an incompetent director's job. His ego must be enormous to launch the actor and the story and put his direction in the center of public attention. He's piled up in their throats. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in "Kill Me Later" that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things start to show promise, Ms. Lustig would dig in her bag of movie tips and put things back in order. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and we could say that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
