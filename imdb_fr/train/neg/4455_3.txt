Where to start? Okay, do not compare this movie to fight a club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on the fight club, violence, blood, blood, etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the screenplay is pretty good and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending, I might add. But the film as a whole is poor, very poor. As people mentioned the accents should not spoil a movie - I disagree - neither a simple casting error, nor a lack of effort in the framing of the vocals made the film unnerving - it was obvious from the scene a certain American / Geordie played the role. Do not get me wrong, handsome guy, who looks great with a skinned head - but not a soccer hooligan. I could go on to tell how ridiculous the football scene is - the "false steward" situation. Moreover, when the GSEs play United in the North, they get on the train and expect only three - it does not make sense - it's a real organization of gangsters and thugs, described in the movie like a mickey. Mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - have not West Ham and Milwall been playing together for the last two years? Hmm, ten years of agreement. And I'm sure "Bother" would be able to waltz in a Milwall cabinet pub. Basically, it's a very poor film that people will love if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel that this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
