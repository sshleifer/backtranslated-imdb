Oh my God. This movie ... it was horrible. I am a huge fan of horror movies. And most of the time, the horror movies that other people say are bad, I like it. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I'll say it. But this plot was awful. It did not make sense! There was too much coolness and a useless (and disgusting) sex scene at first. I think the director was trying to be "shocking" or what, but it was horrible. To add to the pile of purulent poop they called a plot, the actors (in addition to "the scarecrow") are awful, and I did not care so much about them that I quickly forgot who was who. In conclusion, this film made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, please do it.
