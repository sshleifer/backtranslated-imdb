I heard about this movie and I knew it was not really good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. This could be a very good black satire on the current moral of the media. The small features of each participant were good. This led to something that I would not want to miss. But when the so-called show begins, everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. Here's where the author should have added something that would make people think. But instead, he is excited and assumes that people are so stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad that I give it a 1. Even if the movie starts as promising.
