I really wanted to love this movie. He has a pleasant prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly ugly touch of the 80s and it's an effort on the part of actor John Saxon, who also plays the role of a wicked. It reminds me of some Italian horror movies (beloved ones). But the direction is very woody and there is no nightmarish / scary moment on the inside. It goes on and on, and then you have to (logically) end it. More suspense and more daring visuals and his fate as a cult classic would have been sealed.
