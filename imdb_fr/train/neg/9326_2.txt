Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, believe me, this has led to horribly spent money, but also to big bursts of laughter. SICK. is one of the best but funny horror movies we have rented. The plot is over, the whole takes your friends in the woods and never comes back, it's very old. The most gororous part of the movie is like visiting the local butcher shop, except a little dirtier and with blood on the meat that looks like play dough. And if someone has ever been afraid of this movie at any time, he should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of his life, it's pathetic. The good sides of the film are that his two daughters are hot enough, one better than the other and you see them all naked during the movie. The other positive aspect is that this movie is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like watching movies or renting those horrible movies. I do not find it amusing, but it is hilarious to see all the efforts invested by these people who are doing so badly that it is worthwhile to be praised. laughing at someone's falls, I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If you rent / buy it to laugh, I'll give it a rating of 8.5.
