Sensational. I read about this movie and it sounded so horrible that I had to see it. My God, I can feel it in St. Louis. Where do I start? Five years later, National Lampoons was trying to track the success of Animal House, but it completely missed its target. I will go chronologically with these little films. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon Animal House). Apparently he was not working at the time, so the National Lampoons guys probably called to say, "Hey, we're doing a c ** ppy movie, you want to be there?" Peter said "well, I do not do much these days, why not?" He was a great minor character in Animal House, but he could not carry this fiasco fleeing for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is pretty funny, Jason Cooper (Riegert) saying to his wife leave it, she needs to get together. It's too weird that they are really in a happy marriage. So he's chasing her, here she is and Cooper is responsible for the kids. Of course, this leads him to burn his house, lose several children and sleep with an assortment of New York bimbos (including a very young, Diane Lane). Then the woman comes back, wants the children and the movie ends with a coin that will determine the fate of the children. The idea was actually a bit clever, but the director stunk. The characters all seem to fall asleep, they had to be doped. Sorry, your legacy has been tarnished by this flop. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, recently finished college, not knowing what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, starts sleeping with mega-rich, takes their money when they die, and she does not stop as she sleeps the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (oops, I mean the President of the United States). Once again, it could have been funny, and although I'm happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) is not afraid to reveal everything, her game was horrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I have come so far. Here's rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, although he becomes cynical after being touched several thousand times. Nagurski, really, just stopped worrying. He monitors aggression, aggression, etc., and never intervenes. He thinks the world is illegal and he will probably be sued if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi race) participates in the action, calling the police, committing a crime, but having his lawyer on the spot to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been funny, the performances were intentionally campy, but hey, no energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names on this map. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was stopped as well as the rescue attempt in the crisis of the Iranian hostages. If I had been part of this film, I would like my name to be erased, it's horrible. Again, that's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this trash is that Dr. John did the score of the movie (repeating "Go to the movies" over and over again) and that the movie was not much longer than an hour and a half. Show it in the cinema classes with the section "What you should never do in making a film". This script should have been left on the shelf because yes, it's so serious.
