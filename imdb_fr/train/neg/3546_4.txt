Spoilers ahead - proceed with your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that once Harry has learned the identity of the three lifeguards - with relative ease - he continues to yield to their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car so that it explodes (with the money in), which makes us make a big leap of logic. <br /> <br /> OK, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of public view because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. That's what I see, but why not hire someone to slap that hogwash a bit, or even kill them once he would have determined that there was no evidence of blackmail (for example, the Cini's body?). / 3 of it. After that, it falls to pieces.
