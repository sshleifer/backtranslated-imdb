So where are the cannibals? Those who are intrigued by the title and appeal of the "real cannibal" of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his return to a village in Papua New Guinea populated by natives, one of whom was his lover several decades ago. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is Jewish in New York and they mingle with the documentary as it appears in his yamika in several scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories relayed by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. It's not all together a bad movie. Cinematography very interesting and excellent. Schneebaum remains very friendly and offers us a fascinating glimpse of a life as far removed from Western civilization as possible. <br /> <br /> This is just not what she claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, children.
