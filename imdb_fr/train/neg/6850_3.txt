Hinako left her small village to settle in Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died as a teenager. She finds Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected via Shikoku Island. Oh man. I rented this because I love Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a great actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This film is stupid, boring, badly filmed, without imagination and especially without fear. Kuriyama has very little time on screen as a resurrected Sayori, and his character does not have much work with him.
