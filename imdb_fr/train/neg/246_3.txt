This is obviously a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "mysterious island". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on the set and you hear the recorded voices on a recording booth at the same time! It's an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot in New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and read this comment, they will be seduced by a big W. This film is full of defects. You hear the director's voice giving instructions and giving instructions to the actress. "OK now get up." As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The extraterrestrial guy speaks in a deep voice. When he yawns or groans when he fights, you hear the voice of the actor. As for the special effects, man! It was Brett Piper's first job to shout loudly! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. A bit like the animation of Karl Zeman in VOYAGE AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. The music is good. In the end, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANETE DES DINOSAURES look like an epic of Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a movie at home and that its budget was tight? A must for budding filmmakers.
