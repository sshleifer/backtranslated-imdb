Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's the cream of the crop, or s *** if you tend to be more cynical because it ranks (or lowers) there with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least made me laugh stupidly. It made me feel constant pain and applaud when the credits started rolling. No other film made me cringe. Now I will explain exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It's all about a chip in a remote-controlled car (?!) Who is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Nonsense. <br /> <br /> The resulting action is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with traps and everything, but watching these traps running is rather than funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I did not laugh (or even smile) once, I rather cracked and hoped the terrorists would take on the child. The bird, rather than providing comical relief, was a little funny and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The game of actors, as does a group of non-names, varies from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely incomparable and not as funny as a kid, while terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they were quickly pulled off the street ... well, that's it. is all. <br /> <br /> I can see some people say, "Dude, it's for kids, do not say it, man." Well, maybe kids like that, but they can go a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even thinking about going out. Damn, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who are nil - see these reviews for more) are better than that! <br /> <br /> In short, it's an irreparably horrible movie. This has been clearly recycled for the money because it almost completely tears the first two; The only thing to do is completely insult the first two too. No human being, child or otherwise, should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's SO bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
