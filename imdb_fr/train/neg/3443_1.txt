I watched this movie last night and I was hoping for the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the jacket of the DVD looked good. As soon as I started to look at it, I told myself that the others "oh my God, what is it"? Some scary moments but the atmosphere was spoiled by stupid music. There was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes. It ruined everything and I shook my head. thinking that I had lost money a rental and was deceived by the wallet. Nothing against the music itself, it was just in the bad parts of the movie. Anyone who has made the film has no idea what he is doing. The cover was lit, which suggests storm at sea. It would have been more interesting but it did not happen. The acting was not the worst I've ever seen, as they are all unknown, which is obvious for their first film. Another reason I was disappointed was that the plot was meaningless. At first, two men saw all the boat teens, so in the end supposedly there was only one girl and the others were either imaginary friends or ghosts. I'm not sure because it was very poorly represented. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, says this is a true story. He believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area where this film was shot. It was not mentioned in the movie that it would be a true story. I have never experienced something like that personally, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I imagine if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur student horror movies, you may like this.
