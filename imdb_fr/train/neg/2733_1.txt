I debated whether or not to check the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by Scrubs fans, it probably does not fall into the category of spoiler. <br /> <br /> Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew that friends were in the tube when they started with clip gigs ... and five and a half years in Scrubs, they went over and fell into that hole. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the writers just could not be bothered by the writing that week and just said "let's show the other funny stuff". It did not work. <br /> <br /> For starters, showing all the times when people broke down is not funny when you take them out of context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging on his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was hanging on his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Second, for what was supposed to be a compilation of fantasies of JD, we were Turk's dream, another was not his fantasy, although I forget which one. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We have seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit that two of my favorite Scrubs moments have been shown in the latest compilation ... Dr. Cox realizes that Ben is dead ... and JD tells him which He is proud of him. <br /> <br /> But seeing those moments again did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode of our life. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, do not let your show happen the same way as Friends, keep it cool, keep it funny ... or finish it.
