The case is the best part of the film but it is not worth the purchase price alone. I was expecting a film "Based on the true story" to then find a shot on a house video made of badly shot clips linked together by pathetic actor scenes and unrelated slaughterhouses. The video scenes had many rewind situations that were probably used to extend the length of the feature rather than the effects. I started this review even before I was halfway through the movie and I waited until it was over just in case it would end better, but down and that was it, it was getting worse. If I could mark it lower, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.
