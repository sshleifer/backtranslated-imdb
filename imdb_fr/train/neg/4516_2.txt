I bought this DVD box, with the invisible sight, and I would have liked not to have done it. The script required a serious rewrite, as it seemed totally devoid of feelings and flaws from the book. The lighting is horrible, very unpolished, but if it was just that I could look at it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly any introduction to the different characters, which makes it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in the shots - no idea who dies when). <br /> <I have long thought that the key to a good movie is to get the audience to take an interest in the characters; if you do not have that, you have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never got to know them - who they were, what they liked, what motivated them to do what they do. The series lasts 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did all this time if they did not detail the characters - they put a lot of material in it .. I will say that at least an hour has passed to watch them land and take off in their LOL planes (I mean, do we really need to see this again and again ???). I would have given it a much higher rating if they had improved our knowledge of the characters.
