When I read the back of the DVD case, I found that it sounded really interesting ... so ... I asked my mother to throw it in the pile of movies in the "4 for 20" section dollars from Blockbuster. When we got home and played in the movie ... twenty minutes later, we found ourselves turning towards each other and saying, "It's bad, let's put something else. I admit that a few lines of coffee friends made us smile a little. But come, at least have decent actors! From time to time in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie does not go very slowly and looks really interesting, I can get by and laugh a little bit about how they are done) making their lines. But I can only take a lot. The crying scenes gave the impression that the actors had hysterical laughter, there was no delivery to do for their lines. An amateur does not even approach the game in this film. To say that this movie was good had to take REALLY good drugs while watching the movie. It's the most useless thing I've ever had the displeasure to watch. DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS FILM !!!!!
