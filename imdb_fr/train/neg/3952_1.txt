Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful film that does not read like a movie, but as an episode of a sitcom on television when it refers to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip-show. <br /> <br /> The film is consistently filmed and annoying since the first film. Again and again the same images. How boring. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie that I do not want to see. the same scenes again and again and I do not know who would do it. Looks like the whole movie was quickly made to earn a few dollars and that's it.
