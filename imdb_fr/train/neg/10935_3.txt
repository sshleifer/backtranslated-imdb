I have never been a big fan of Mormon movies. As a Mormon, I always thought that humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us feel like crazy. I was hoping it would be a breath of fresh air, the Halestorm movie that I could finally talk about with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> My boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> I thought, as there were B list artists like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it would at least have to be a little funny. And besides, basketball in the churches is ripe and can be the subject of many hilarious and other gags. But I must say that throughout the film, it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. Every joke has fallen flat and every opportunity for a really funny gag has been ignored. The dialogue was bland and the movie had one of the worst character developments I have ever seen. All the characters except that of Wilson did not have a dimension. It's hard to believe that after nine rewrites, the film was still as stunning as the train wreck I witnessed. I can not express in words the rage I felt while sitting in there My friends and I were extras in the final scene of the game. So we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there and I must say that I avoided contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, apparently ready to receive his comments. I could not tell him that his film had not only taken a good hour and a half of my life, but that it had left a painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> I had some specific problems: there was a minor minor intrigue between the janitor and the chubby pianist, but these two characters came out of nowhere and it was impossible to care about them. My friends and I constantly wondered why they were supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were many secondary intrigues that popped up every now and then, each promising the public the chance to laugh, but each came and went in a puff of smoke, ending even before you could start worrying about yourself. That's about what the whole film felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a major failure, and I'm sorry for all those who are waiting for the first film TRUE funny and Mormon. Certainly, the jokes of it are not too exclusive to the Mormons. Again, it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a strong ringing sensation in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. Spare the disappointment I went through
