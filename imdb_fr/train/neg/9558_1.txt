I thought it was a sequel of some kind, and it's supposed to be the original of 1983. But a sequel does not take the original plot and does not destroy it. <br /> <br /> I had very few expectations for this movie, but I just lost 95 minutes of life. No suspense - I feel really clairvoyant, I play badly and I am full of technical mistakes. I could not believe it. They tried to make a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. But it's not even worthy of a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie, it's a waste of time. Rather, get the original. The theme is still valid. Do not leave too much power in a machine. And the acting and the plot are much more exciting and compelling.
