I was totally disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews on this site and was expecting a lot more. I was expecting a drama with a more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some commentators here would have us believe. I understand that he repeated the same series of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would give it 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Interpretation: 6 out of 10 The direction is 5 out of 10. The scenario is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I removed the film from my DVR at 70 minutes. in the movie. Films better than that ...
