There is no reason to watch this movie. If you have made a lot of money and spent your time discovering all the pleasures of life and have come to a point where you are losers and have time to kill (as if it would ever happen), then get this movie in the video store (if you can find it AND support the wizard who makes fun of you, then ask for this movie, but prepare for your mind to be invaded by extremely ferocious wooden actors by absolutely everyone Oliver Reed ends his great career playing with a drunkard - go understand, but wait, I forgot that there is a reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy showing her chest! Unfortunately no other reason than this one !
