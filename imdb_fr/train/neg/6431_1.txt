This film is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that have been put in place by the most brazen fools to work on a TV movie. The story is false and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's a horrible scam, and I'm amazed that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this basket did so to attack a man justified by history and fearing that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan succeeded McCarthy and could not stop it, hence the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never watch this movie if you are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Betrayal" for a better overview of the truth about Senator McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help you to know what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
