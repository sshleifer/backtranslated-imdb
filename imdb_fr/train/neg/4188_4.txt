I am a great brand for Neil Young's music, and with that and the praise that the film received in many independent press circles, was the first Greendale screening I could find. My enthusiasm was short-lived, while this turquoise plot and low lyric impulse left most of the audience asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started as a soundtrack just filming the soundtrack. Not the best way to create a story. No character has a real bow, and when "significant" events occur, the viewer does not care, because the levels of technical discomfort of the film are so high at this point. The film is a song, and to this end, the characters chained the lyrics as they are sung ... The technique works for the first stanza is over and she has tight nerves. This does not sound real or false, but simply undesirable. <br /> <br /> A terrible game, with characters who find an atmosphere and play it all. Bad lighting sometimes. The only congratulations that I can give to the film concern several scenes shot as news, but the technique is so much used in the cinema today that this film did not contribute much to its progression. A good soundtrack, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad movie.
