I love Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking Heaven Can Wait is acceptable, but the filmmakers have followed too much the plot of this turkey. When Eddie Murphy redid Dr. Doolittle and Professor Nutty, he totally redid them - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just lukewarm remakes. That's why they succeeded. If Chris did the same, it could have been a much better movie. The few bursts of laughter that lead to him unfold when he performs his stand-up routine - so he could just as well have made a movie together. It would also have been a lot more fun if the white man he lives in is a truck driver or a mountain man. So why is Hollywood still doing junk food like this? Because people will see it - because they like Chris Rock. So, give Chris a decent storyline and give us better movies! Do not redo movies that were not so good at first!
