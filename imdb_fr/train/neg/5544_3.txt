This film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, but it is surprisingly observable on many levels. First, for the old movie fans, it's interesting to see the main role played by Dean Jagger (no connection with Mick). While Jagger later played a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even winning the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is really unique because he really has thick hair (I have never seen it that way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This film shows that if an actor can not play in his previous films, that does not mean that he can not learn to be a great actor. Paul Newman is another good example of this phenomenon. His first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 50s. <br /> <br /> A second reason to watch the film is its cheesiness aspect. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and a nameless Cambodian walk in the water, it is obvious that they are really walking on the spot and the background is poorly projected behind them. In addition, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Horrific continuity and insanely bad dialogue abound throughout the film - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to play in the film - since they have both played in many level 2 horror movies. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a movie class on how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> Thus, giving a 3 is probably a little too generous, it's fun to laugh. In short, it's worth a look for bad moviegoers.
