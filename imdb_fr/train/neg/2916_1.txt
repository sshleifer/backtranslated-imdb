It's the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The plot and the message are horrible. There are too many mistakes in this film that can not be followed. I do not even understand how this movie can get an appointment, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee portrays an angry / irrational detective who was caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's angry, okay. Disadvantages: Regarding the scene of the explanation, he can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too wrong and it seems that he literally pulls tears out of the corner of his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To associate the film with the title, there were barking or cries during the movie. scenes of combat and rape, which is totally irrelevant and confusing for the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or not, but it's so stupid! 3) WHY HECK HAS NOT IMPEDED THE KILLER IN THE COPS? What's wrong with this movie? When the murderer started to stab an officer, SHOOTER. He is already dead! What the hell? The killer has had many opportunities to get killed, but I do not know why. 4) During the scene where the girl hurt her foot. In the scene, it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how is it that in the next scene, she lends all her weight on her left foot? And is the actress named best new artist? WTF? 5) The movie sounds are not synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I guess this film tries to raise awareness about the brutality and violence of children in Southeast Asia. Why does the villain win and then the cop joined the fight? 7) This film is simply too violent without purpose. Cops beat gravely in pi, then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is the worst film overall. I really think that the person who wrote this film is a sadistic and sick person. I have never seen such a disgusting movie in my life. THE WORST FILM EVER!
