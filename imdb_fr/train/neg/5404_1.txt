Have you ever had this urge to kill an hour or two doing housework and watching a movie so bad that it defies reason? Well, by renting movies a weekend, I see the illustrations for this one and I see the T-Rex. Knowing very well that the dinosaur on the package was Jurassic Park's T-Rex, I knew I had to rent it because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. the least. <br /> <br /> Crazy scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fate and its shareholders than life, and of course, a big T-Rex, poorly animated puppet sock. Is it our tour of the film where are there scenes clearly separated from the other films? Not to mention Rex's hunger is never satisfied ... never. The way he's hungry, it's beyond me because he does not really have the throat (really if you look in his mouth when he roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, I like to watch incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a movie is. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure it's supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you're going to laugh. <br /> <br /> Do I blame the film budget ... yes, but the acting did not help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, like some female roles ... when you cry, should not we cry? Meh, I'm not going to be mad at this movie, I knew what I was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then look at Jurassic Park immediately and then Lost World back to back. You will write thank you letters to Mr. Spielberg the next day.
