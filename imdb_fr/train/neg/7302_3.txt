The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After that, he went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not help but think of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie to learn not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this film that we just stop and wonder if the cast and the entire crew just stopped working at some point. What surprises me most in this film is that it brought in $ 22 million in box office receipts and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for successfully removing this one.
