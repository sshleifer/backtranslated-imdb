This film was shot immediately after the 1992 reworking of Conan Doyle's famous novel, "The Lost World". And it shows. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite promising, with a ruthless organization wanting to exploit the lost world and Challenger and al going back to defend the prehistoric plateau, but things get complicated. Everyone is stuck on the set and we end up with a weak repetition, boring and too long of the first film. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs (which we almost never see) are simply laughable. Are we supposed to take seriously this stuffed animal that is supposed to be ankylosaur? And the Tyrannosaurus seems rooted on the spot. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get the silent version of the lost world of 1925. Incredibly in this era of CGI and other advanced effects, the 1920s version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent overhaul.
