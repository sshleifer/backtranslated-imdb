Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a lame film. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was someone who was punishing me by watching one dreadful movie after another. I do not know, I guess I needed a hobby during my teenage years. A proscribed teenager (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an old mirror. Soon, she discovers the awful power of this ancient mirror and uses it to strike those who have wronged her. Movies like these, the power giver has an unpleasant side effect. This one changes it inside and outside if it wishes it or not. <br /> <br /> The brothel of a movie that, for some reason, has been restored to d.v. few years ago. I do not know why. They should have left it on the board and collected the dust. People love this enemy movie for some reason. If you do, I would like to know why. Until then, I do not like this movie and I have no reason to see it again. <br /> <br /> This is not recommended at all.
