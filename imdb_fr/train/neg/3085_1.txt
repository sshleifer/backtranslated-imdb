Description: Corny, completely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame that you will wonder why these abnormally stupid people have even lost about two months to spend a budget (I guess that ...) probably no more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save your time, your life and your money, by NOT - I repeat, DO NOT think even if you should or not see this movie . This film is so old-fashioned that your face will turn purple with indignant boredom. If you have a single-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You could actually admire it. (As I said before, IF you have a one-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors, puppets bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I introduced you will make a personal video slightly more entertaining than this piece of absolute shit.
