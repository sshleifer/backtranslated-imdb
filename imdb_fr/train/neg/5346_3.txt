I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the film met expectations. In fact, this sometimes makes viewing pretty uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual antics are reduced to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the actors and lines are appalling. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic imagination combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery and fails in every respect. It is as if Meyer was trying to compensate for the sexual exploitation / blackploitation by transmitting a higher moral message. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty of being excited by the blatant domineering connotations of the first scene showing Lady Susan brandishing a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to return to the right path by transforming it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, as they cancel each other out, you do not end up with anything. <br /> <br /> Because it's so serious in so many ways, it's worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible film in the worst case. possible taste. Perhaps, because it's so serious, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.
