The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE involves college students playing a cruel phone game that surprises them unexpectedly (for them, if not for horror fans). 7EVENTY 5IVE's HISTORY, on the other hand, is that of a horror movie that promised a little bit of promise, unfortunately overtaken by a really bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun, if a little This story of ridiculous and old-fashioned slasher is denied from the beginning by the erroneous belief of its filmmakers that the public would enjoy watching a group of rich children and screaming bickering during most of the film. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer (in a minor role designed primarily to add the film's exclusive power), every character on the screen is a different breed of young character. (<br /> <br /> Men and women, black and white, heterosexual and gay, a whole group of shallow, high-school students is the main narrative of the film, even worse, since the story is about a PARTY game that went bad, most of the time, the scenes are completely full of these little b ***** ds, so there are few breaks for the viewer, who has to bear the shots very few protagonists, even if at least some of these people are supposed to be friends, all the characters invariably interact in a very hostile way, long before a real conflict really happened, resulting in the worst possible outcome in a slasher movie: The public, supposed to be concerned about the tracks, not only encourages the anonymous killer, but also wants him to arrive earlier to get the empty kids back. <Br /> <br /> Shame of this bad characterization is q otherwise, 7EVENTY 5IVE would actually have potential. Visually it's good. New directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to create a suspenseful atmosphere. They also manage to produce certain moments of gore in the manner of the classic and competent 80s. Surprisingly, the casting of the production is also quite capable. It's not that the actors are not able to express a realistic human emotion; it's just that the screenplay (co-written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who was much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) lacks such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE is hardly recommended, because its usual principle and its thrills can not compensate for the bad taste left by a story animated by a multitude of unpleasant characters. In this tepid polar, the real mystery is why anyone should be interested in a group of young people who can not even love each other.
