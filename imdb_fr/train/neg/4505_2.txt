Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed film, there is no doubt. And the acting is generally excellent, at least as far as the representation of the characters in their script is concerned. <br /> <br /> However, so many details, big and small, only hurt, that it bothers me too much to be able to fully enjoy. A small detail that characterizes this kind of senselessness is a scene (no, it does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings the bell that rings at the door of the house where Sayuri lives, a snowy day. The bell it rings is a windmill or wind chime - it only stays outside homes in Japan in summer! The inhabitants of the traditional Japanese homes had not sounded at the door. They just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think that this is such a trivial detail, but I would say it is equated with a film shot on America where a Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and no one I do not even think about the totally false hairstyles given to maiko and geisha, who are vaguely Pan-Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing else. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to represent is really reflected in the attitudes and representations of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I guess the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), the more I suppose that more you will appreciate that. Honestly, I think this film could have been so much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "Exotic Japan".
