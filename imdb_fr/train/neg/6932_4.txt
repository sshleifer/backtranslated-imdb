I waited a long time to see the DUNGEON OF TORTURE OF DR TARR and, having looked at it, I was very disappointed. This is not the baroque film I was expecting. The trailer (I saw on a DVD Something Weird) is much better than the entire movie, which is remarkably forgettable. There is almost no scene that stands out and the overall look is interesting, but it is not even comparable to other Baroque, Fellini or Jodorowsky style movies. The characters are sad and there is almost nothing dramatic, even if we see rapes, crucifixions, dementia, and so on. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR's TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was -thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence, mood or whatever, but we see / listen to the main characters chatting about boring things all the time. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
