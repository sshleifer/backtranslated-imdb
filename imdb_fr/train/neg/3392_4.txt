What about Indonesian music movies? I have never seen any Indonesian musical movies like Bollywood. The spirit of history is lacking and only a few lines of what they call poetic lines are missing. <br /> <br /> The story of the love of two separated children who find themselves after several years of changes does not have special remarks. It is a simple narrative plot (but it is quite targeted) with narrative musical stories "here and there". <br /> <br /> The confusing characters who should be saved by a brilliant game are overlooked. The main actress can try to live the character, but it's the best she can do, try. As for casting, I do not feel the need to put a Balinese student in this story and, of course, these are not the only useless characters. <br /> <br /> What is strange is why I would like to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
