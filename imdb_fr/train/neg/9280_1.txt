Honestly, I do not know what's more funny, this horrible remake, nor the comments on this forum. The criticism of Masterpiece made me cry, it's so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst of all time and certainly the bottom of the barrel for the sequels. The name "Omen" on the title made me stop this morning on HBO, but it is a slap to the other three, especially the original. There are so many bad classic moments, but my favorite is the guy who catches the juggler at the psychic fair !! good time ! This movie is in the Omen series what "Scary Movie" is to the whole genre. Avoid unless you try to laugh.
