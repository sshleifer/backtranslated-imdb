A decent film, with a beautiful head woman, but a terrible head man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a very bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. She is the best player in the pack. <br /> <br /> NOTE * the first comment of the one who praised the film (and, according to his account on IMDB.com, wrote only ONE review - and guess for which movie?) is obviously a plant. Although the film is well shot, it is by no means subtle, nor excellent, nor any other hypobolic description that the critic uses. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is an honest movie, but it's a big provocation. He offers all kinds of sexual situations but never goes there. It's like watching a skin flick on Cinemax, but with all the "nasty pieces" coming out. <br /> <br /> The film, as a whole, is a little fuzzy and the end, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. Of course, there is an end to the twist, because each film finds today necessary to have an end to the twist. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
