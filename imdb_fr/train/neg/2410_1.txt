Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films that these guys have made seem to have come together and filmed that with their friends who have no talent one afternoon when they got bored (the lines are completely misunderstood and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur films and 90% of domestic video are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hey, let's see if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movies!" Let's hope nobody else was. My apologies to the people involved in the cop because this criticism is a bit harsh, but I was the dope who read your fake reviews and bought the movie.
