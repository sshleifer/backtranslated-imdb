The reason why this movie is so bad is that it is very badly written, and it is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly banal and the dialogue is wooden and improbable. A failing couple - a stuck American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed - is swept away by a powerful and autonomous criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternating with scenes shows the warmer side from the murderer, she leaves the impotent partner of the killer who, unhappy, sees it more clearly than anyone else before. Nothing can help this film succeed, not even Scott Glenn's screaming face as a killer, nor the seductive Latinity of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, nor even the strong performance of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist to find the killer. A serious waste of time.
