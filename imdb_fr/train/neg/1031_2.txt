This film is a long chick after another. First of all, although they did their part, there is an unjustified dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatles cartoons. John is the wicked, envious, homosexual hid, Yoko's slave. He is described as being in the discredited book of Albert Goldman. They even continue to talk about songs in their usual conversations "it was always just two of us"! John would not have been so mean to his fans. As if his death had shown us he was too kind. The most amusing scene is when a stupid Beatles fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something like, "Of course, and while I'm growing up, why do not you get on your knees, put on your wife's wig and lick my liggin". It made me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny in the gravity with which it tries to become ridiculous. John and Paul also did not spend the whole day pontificating, they were funny light-hearted guys who, even during the Beatles break, separate much more charming than the one described here. Forget it.
