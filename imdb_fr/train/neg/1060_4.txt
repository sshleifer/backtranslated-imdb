Okay, so it was written in 1996, before September 11th, so you could give him a credit for worrying about the terrorists and the idea that the CIA director would plot to blow up that plane. abandoned before it degenerates into disaster. the world is prescient. That's all. It's the good things. The acting game ... just. The plot ... silly. The "twist" ... useless. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody ever thought about what to do when a plane was contaminated. Do not you think that bureaucrats have a manual on "wounds" and how to contain it? The proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we have seen after Katrina. But they have a plan. This is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the door of the plane open and the "shooters" standing unprotected? In fact, has anyone ever been able to shoot him with legs? That would stop him. But not so dramatic I am a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. But it was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a recorder, so I did not watch all the commercials, it was an advantage, it's a good example of why I watch so little TV on the network.
