If you liked the first two movies, then I'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one. This is really useless and useless content in video, probably a continuation made on television. The scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis), still silly and kind, still lives with his family and he has his own business, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid that it reduces his brother. Then he narrows his wife and sister-in-law. Now adults need to find a way to convince the children in the house to enlarge them. A good part of the repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, for example. a toy car roller coaster, swimming in the dip, etc. Pretty poor!
