First, this film begins on a very stupid note: a 10-year-old girl, playing in a moving vehicle, decides that it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then cause a horrible accident kill the mom ... duh .... I'm sorry, there's really no 10-year-old kid who's stupid. The rest of the movie is not much better. After the death of the mother, apparently the most stupid little girl of 10 years of the planet, the father moves with his family to Genoa, Italy, where he must teach in a local university, but here is the decisive factor: he does not speak no word of Italian! Then, the little girl has "visions" of mom (that she has killed), and often nocturnal terrors that always always end with the father who holds and pampered her. We are then forced to watch this family more and more get lost, then to meet, then to hug, then to cry and get lost, then to meet again (followed of course more and more hugs) and crying) to the point that I really wanted some sort of natural disaster. Just erase all those ignorant and ignorant people from the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I like indies, but an independent group of stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is just ridiculous and useless. It's a shame that this movie is based on such tasteless characters who wallow in such delayed scenarios, because the locale was interesting.
