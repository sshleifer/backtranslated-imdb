It's interesting at first. A naive ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) whom he has only recently known. They seem to be happy, so she disappears without warning. He searches for it and, after a few dead ends, comes across a part of his abused childhood and his recent shady past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems that filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, although not as suspensory as it may seem, is at least watchable. Then it stops being interesting or even making a lot of sense. And the end is so lame, so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you will think that the writers did not know what to do with it and were bored. What a waste of good idea!
