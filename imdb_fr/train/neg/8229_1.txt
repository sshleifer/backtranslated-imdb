- Contains minor spoilers - <br /> <br /> I have seen a number of independent horror films such as The Hamiltons, The Mandy Love Boys Lane and Cabin Fever; Unfortunately, I felt that five vis-Ã -vis does not fall into this category. From beginning to end, the film is in the grip of an amateur acting game resonating with a very bad scenario. Only God knows why the writer (s) has (have) thought of a dialogue of the type "No, do not go out, do not go out, she will get you: if she gets you, she will kill you and if she kills you , you are dead "is the quality of film. <br /> <br /> This film shows very little character development and to be honest I do not care less about the pain and torture that was inflicted on them, since they are just 'a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no quality who redeems them'. All they do is cry and moan throughout the film and if the girls do not cry their quarrel; when they discuss, the topics are completely random: about the dating of boys or about how one of their daughter's daughters was recently cremated (appropriate topics when pursued by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also abominable exposing the techno cheesy music during the opening and ending credits (though hearing the credit music knowing that the end was nearing seemed like a paradise). <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is appalling and sometimes makes the film unassailable. I guess because of his limited or nonexistent budget, the director was limited to a single digital camera that resides in the girls' car almost the entire film. I think it was an effort to get the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But because of a very fragile camera, a grainy image and an approach too close to the action, it can be difficult to say what happens during the action scenes and is simply chaotic. To make a subjective film is one thing, but to make an action on the screen that an audience can not decipher because of a mediocre cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is an independent film with a small budget. movie but that does not excuse the extremely mediocre quality. This film contains no redeeming factor: bad acting, poor scenario, poor camera work and no story. In light of all this, I decided to give the film 1 out of 10, which left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the ground bringing me a sweet relief. His 94 minutes of stupid college students cry, argue, run aimlessly and have inappropriate conversations at random. However, how often do you see girls defecating in their hands and throwing shit on the windshield of a car chasing after?
