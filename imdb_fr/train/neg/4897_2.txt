This film is for me the ultimate disappointment to Tsai Ming-Liang. He breathes the laziness of each image. So, I will not analyze this thoroughly either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why do we see urban landscapes blooming with green trees? I wonder if this was supposed to make sense in the film's metaphorical context (in which thirst informs the need for intimacy and watermelon as a trivial substitute, sex). Or, it's just a matter of ugly film, without worrying about consistency. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or probably dead. This seems to be an irrelevant issue as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully transmitted (= by bombing), but retrospectively, its inert body turns out to be a cheap dramaturgical gadget, a pretext ?? he is as free and exploitative as the activity in which he is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing is expressed in this film that Antonioni had not expressed better 40 years ago ?? and without unnecessarily humiliating his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') resembled the idea of ​​an artistic counterpoint by a high school student, performed at this very secondary skill level. If it was, the point was zero.
