This film was physically painful to watch, perhaps because (like many people my age and younger), I grew up with Dr. Seuss and worshiped his books - both funny, intelligent, whimsical and subversive . "The cat in the hat" sucks all the interest and arouses the story, and the performance of Mike Myer as Cat is for the most part disconcerting. Why the accent of the Borscht belt, the little funny fight, the inappropriate jokes, the unattractive costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and much too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect all children's movies to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but it has reached a new floor. How could Mike Myers need this money?
