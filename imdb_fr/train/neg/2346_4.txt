I did not see this film for the first time for the first time in TCM's Essentials series. The clich√© of the viewer's eye has never been so timely. This viewer has seen little value in this one. I was intrigued by Lucy's infinite attraction (Lauren Bacall). Admittedly, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie, her character is more beautiful than attractive. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would be more likely to ignore Lucy than to fall in love with her. For Bacall's defense, this film was shot at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the deterioration of his health could have affected his performance. Of course, a part of Lucy's mouse was to contrast it with the slut Marylee, played to the end and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she performs a madly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs leading to a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance surpasses the rest, though Jasper Hadley's weariness over the disappointing behavior of her two children is brilliantly described by Robert Keith. In general, I would say that I am not a big fan of melodrama. The caricatural behavior of the characters creates a story too improbable for my taste.
