For moviegoers who have never heard of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" and who have never seen Robert Wise's (1963) production with Julie Harris, this remake will look pretty damn bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have done it, it's downright awful. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), wacky computer improvements and new impetus in Jackson's story condemning this remake. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It's still scary without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and credible. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, the 1963 follows the much closer.
