I knew it was not a job between me and D-wars from the moment we met. First, his title was lazy. D war. Like writing Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you really can not be so blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do what he wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a difficult relationship between us has been the insane progression of history. Here is the movie, a dream reporter reporting on snake chunks, a flashback to a time when he and his father wandered into what was supposed to be the competition for the Gremlins store and a dream journalist found a shining box . The old shop reveals several terrible truths. This Bauraki, a supposedly evil serpent, was deceived to become a god. tell the boy that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles is his reincarnated lover and gives him a jewel of junk. The shop also reveals that, despite his obvious whiteness, he is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, a dream journalist remembers this perfectly and begins to act half-crazy trying to find this girl at random. Cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes, my brain is melting from my nose. Why? Keep reading if you have the balls. <br /> <br /> Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the advantage of having a best Asian friend and in the scene where she starts to panic and make posters with Asian characters, he tells me that the one who made this movie has no idea what 'he does. It's a Korean legend and she's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later in the night, her dragon armadillo starts to hurt her, she calls the police because she seems to have a heart attack. You see, in this crazy world, they apparently manage heart attacks differently, because the next time we see her, she will be locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse will say she is crazy. I have a new phobia now, and that if I ever get into trouble, the first responders will assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress, Dwar. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a sassy black friend. In scenes prior to Miffed Near, Bauraki killed an elephant, slipped into a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were scared to go out after 9/11, but we all had to toughen up after deciding that coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives. As usual, no giant snake will stop me from drinking caffeine. If I stay inside and fear for my life, terrorists and serpentine deities will prevail. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying dragon during the helicopter battle, my cruel lover, Dwar, treats me to a scene filled with vinegar and banknotes to finish. Bauraki has his own fortress and right under LA, I suppose. They do not really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah are stunned in a car accident that would kill less important men and, when they wake up, the dragon palace. Some dialogues delayed later, a good Dragon serpent god comes out of nowhere and snakes fight / make love, whatever. And I'm not kidding with a good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I disproportionate it, I'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie so suddenly ... there! Seconds later, the good dragon becomes god of the dragon, fire Baurki, Sarah turns into a ghost and joins Dragon-god, a dream journalist left in the middle of nowhere, accumulates the credits ... thank god <br /> <br /> Now, our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy who looked like a turtle shredder and who spoke exactly like a Star Wars defense raider. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do what he wanted when he wanted but could never be useful. He could cross a wall in a scene where it was useless. He could go in your dreams when it would be useless and he could light the fire of ten randomly selected soldiers, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to the touch of these scrap jewelry. I like it because it was hit twice by a car in the same scene and made fantastic sounds of Tuskan raids. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were great ... so great, it meant terribly. Jason Behr, whom I found great at Roswell, I slowly discover that I can only act one way. It's pretentious, it's a spaceship and Patrick Dempsey is "ish". <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this dirty prostitute, Dwars, is her main actor, Bauraki. This giant snake acted his heart. I would dare to say that he was better at playing a devil's half-god of the Cgi than John Barrymore to play Richard III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder of his small, deadly support group. When he ate an elephant, I had the impression that no one but the past, the present or the future would eat an elephant with so much feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul in every second of this cursed project. Yes, damn it, my favorite actor in this movie was a CGI snake. I have the courage to admit it, do not I? <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Bauraki gets more work and is not typed, that Jason Behr discovers a range of emotions other than the dreamy look, and that I never have to look at Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, D-War it's over. I want to recover my CDs and just be friends
