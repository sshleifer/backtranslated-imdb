Ok, here is the basic plot. We are in 1933. Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese who has lived long enough. The film begins with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) extends his life. Well on this occasion the elixir is awkwardly deposited by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther films) and he orders his subordinates to go then find 6 rare objects to make the elixir. This creates a global hunt for man in which his henchmen end up robbing diamond museums and venturing to London to meet the nemisis of Dr. Fu, a retired Scotland Yard inspector, Nayland Smith, played also by Sellers who tries to prevent it. to be a humorous comic adventure. <br /> <br /> It is apparently the last Sellers feature film he made before his death. The terrible tragedy is that he was there. Sellers who are such a talented comedian and have had memorable "funny" roles in Panther movies and especially in the movie "The Party", have nothing to do with this movie. This film was a real torture and I could not even finish it. He died completely and I kept looking back while watching Sellers' performance. After coming from the great work of 'Being There' a year earlier how, I mean, how can he do that and how was this thing even made ??? As one person mentioned, the first 10.15 minutes are acceptable, but then it's all downhill ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 of 10.
