.... CAUSE IT'S CRAP! The kind of film that makes you want to go hit the filmmaker and say "WHY?". Horrible work of the camera ... count the number of times the camera tries to stay stable on a person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comic. Looks like they have invaded a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie with the least amount of money possible. I bet $ 10 that they used home video cameras to do that. Either that, or most cameramen were intoxicated. Really the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you want to organize a "worst movie night", bring it. You want more entertainment ... stare at a wall.
