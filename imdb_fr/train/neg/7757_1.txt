I also have some advice to give to the people who made this film. If you want to make a movie like this, make sure you can use the f / x to save it. Also, do not bring in a group of actors from the z list. Another thing, we almost all saw Jurassic Park, so do not copy it blatantly. Overall, this film is nil, f / x, aspired, actor, story without originality. Let's talk about the actor for a second, the guy from Carradine who made his career in 1984 had its heyday with "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a superb comedy). It is not exactly a z list, it can act. He should have just said no to this bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as "Nerd" and that should have been it. I understand he has bills to pay, but that does not justify that bag. Have I already called this movie? OKAY. I just wanted to be on. If I seem a little hostile, I'm sorry. I just lost 2 hours of my life that I could have spent on something productive, like watching painting, and I feel cheated. I will finish on this note. Thank you for your time.
