This film is void from the beginning until (especially) the end. You probably do not get worse, actor, screenplay, photography, camera work, etc. Everything is bad, very very very bad. <br /> <br /> But that's what makes it a "big" watch, it'll give you more than enough good laughs. The worst, the best! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people thought about this movie. A serious viking film? The story is damn ridiculous, it's more like a comedy disguised, a bit like a mafia, useless too damn funny. <br /> <br /> And look for the very end of the movie ...
