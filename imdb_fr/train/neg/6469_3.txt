When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good as a kid, so I decided to see what happened next. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequels, because the first movie is usually the best, and it is. Essentially, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed out of the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the nasty at the octopus of movie 1), Morgana who awaits. When the girl goes out, she asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her mother. It brings Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story that could have had a little more thought. Adequate!
