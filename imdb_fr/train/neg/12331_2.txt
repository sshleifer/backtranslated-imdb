One of those "in the making" films that should be nostalgic for adults and a promise for kids. This film has neither one nor the other. It's a sorry excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body double in her arms with Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is stupid or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly because we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone to bury a dead woman in her garden. Think hard about why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a double. As the movie continued, I began to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and Little Miss Millions where Sylvia Kristel seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt while Howard Hesseman made us nostalgic for WKRP. Look at this to laugh at the stupidity of others, for the committed performance of Ed Begley Jr. or to ask what would Sylvia Kristel look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from Sylvia Kristel's films that are not Emmanuelle.
