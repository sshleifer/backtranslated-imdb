Istanbul is one of those expatriate films made by Errol Flynn in the last ten years of his life, in order to provide for his family and avoid trouble with the IRS. It's a remake of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner's movie in Singapore about ten years ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike this studio product, Istanbul enjoys this excellent cinematography in full view of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was exponentially aging in front of the camera in all movies, was way too old to play these types of action / adventure longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really lack conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she embodies the former darling of Errol who, by the trauma of being saved from a fire, now suffers from amnesia. She does not remember Errol anymore and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has evil people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are looking for diamonds he has come into possession of. We must also deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Today, most people do not realize that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist, they only see him as a singer. In fact, it was first of all a pianist, the song was an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for fans of this type of movie.
