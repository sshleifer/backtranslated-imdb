"The Virgin of 40 years" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world where an employee of an electronics store can tell his boss to "fuck" and broadcast videos of his naked ass all over the store and not to be reprimanded. A world where it's really fun to drive while intoxicated and crash into the cars of others. A world where it seems normal that a boss sexually harasses his subordinates. A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the apparent chorus of viewers who liked this film. I thought every scene looked like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny at first, and beyond any rational thought. The scene of the hair removal in the chest continued FOREVER. <br /> <br /> The characters, aside from Carell, were totally on a note. And the romantic elements were completely artificial, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was just bad. <br /> <br /> And I also found the sequence "Aquarius" totally boring and excessive. I hated hated this movie!
