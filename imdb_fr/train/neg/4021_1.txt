This is probably the worst movie of all time, it's a shame that the name of Roger Corman is associated. I could have understood it at the beginning, when he had a reduced budget, but today, there are no more excuses to give birth to that! I am a pervert of the movie "B" and, from the point of view of some people, all the movies I love are put aside by "viewers", but trust me on this one, the Vampire club is in the lead from my list of the best It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the score is totally out of place, the sound effects are just not effective and, finally, Mr. Savage does not seem to know he's in a movie vampires, which is a shame. Because he had a career "not too bad" above all. Let me know if I'm too hard on this cause because I do not like a movie, I tend to forget that it's a good side.
