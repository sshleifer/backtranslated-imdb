Amelia and Michael are a married couple who are mistaken for each other. Amelia is a long time in love with the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two convent of infidelity but finally manage to connect to each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this short film. The direction is direct and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves something to be desired. Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It's a bit difficult to see how this story stands out from any other story of infidelity, except that it is much smaller and no meaning (a welcoming change of pace, the optionally). <br /> <br /> I do not know, it is possible that I do not connect to these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that the blockages in these stories are generally the same, that is to say that a couple speaks together while avoiding visual contact by masquerading as magazines, etc. The good side of the shorts is that they offer a little more room to try something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
