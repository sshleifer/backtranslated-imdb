It was a complete disappointment. The acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that I sometimes felt the need to stop it, but unfortunately I managed and I ended up a little embarrassed by the bad movie in his together. Its good. if you are o.k. with moral plots and do not mind watching a movie that misinterprets Whitman. If you want a fictional cheese story, go for it.
