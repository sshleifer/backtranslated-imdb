As is often the case, movies about characters who hate themselves do not usually make a good drama. "Download Nancy" is no exception. This is supposed to be based on a true story about a woman murdered at her own request by a person on the Internet. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello), married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game that his company has successfully marketed in various bars and restaurants. Unlike most human beings, Albert has virtually no positive attributes (except for his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a dark, hard expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to prostitution prostitution. When his wife asks to have sex, he punishes her by masturbating in front of her. <br /> <br /> Nancy is just as unique as a person. Not only did she have a 15-year-old loveless marriage, but she was sexually assaulted by her uncle when she was growing up (thankfully, there is no turning back of this story in the movie). Her self-disgust takes the form of mutilation and, as a result, she is forced to undergo treatment. However, she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis on the Internet. It's a bit of a sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money while inflicting tremendous pain. It is revealed that Louis has two children but he does not see them anymore (the child's mother does not want to have anything to do with him anymore). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to first have a painful sexual relationship with Louis and then have him killed. . There is a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis makes love to Nancy by cutting her vagina with a broken piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis' visit to Albert who ties him up and hits him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a double plan to go to see Albert: 1) reprimand him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) enjoy the blows he receives. It takes a while before Louis reveals Nancy's fate - he forces Albert to do her the favor of taking her dog to a parent so that someone can take care of it in the future. Of course, Nancy's fate is that Louis ends up suffocating him (but he hesitated first by explaining that he had "feelings" for her). We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What exactly do we have to remember from a movie like Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to have pity on the victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is this the main point of the film? Is sympathy for Nancy really justified? I do not think so. The writers of the film create a man of straw in the character of Albert - someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is responsible for the decline of Nancy. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I do not think so. They have the disgusting Louis, a man who earns his living by inflicting suffering on him, who comes and blames Albert for neglecting Nancy. In addition, her expressions of love for Nancy (before killing her) are supposed to show her "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter if the filmmakers have defined where the characters of the film are. Downloading Nancy is nothing but an exercise of bad taste and soft pornography. They are so determined to titillate their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence.
