Having loved "Paris, I Love You", I was very much expecting this film and I admit that I came with great expectations, but I was deeply disappointed for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect a resumption of Paris in New York, I expected the same structure. What I liked about "Paris" is the dissolution of neighborhoods. You have an idea of ​​each director's style and the story they want to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different times in the film, characters from different stories intersect, which left me confused as to who I was watching and exactly what was going on. In addition, the change of director was obvious but confusing since there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked in the movie 'Paris' was the different love takes. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, an unrequited love, a solitary middle-aged woman in search of love, etc., which explored many layers of the complexity of love between humans. "NY" seemed to be aimed only at extravagant and outdated sexuality. There were exchangeable shorts (the older couple having spent their whole life, Julie Christie's short film), but overall, the movie The'NY 'did not cause any emotion to me. I did not connect to any of the characters as I did with "Paris". I remember watching 'Paris' and felt a deep sadness, loneliness, nostalgia, hope, wonder ... it was so soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had entered this movie without seeing 'Paris' standing in the back of my brain, this film could have attracted the attention more favorable response, but as a recovery eponymous of "Paris, I love you", I was deeply disappointed.
