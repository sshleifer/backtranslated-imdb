This is the slogan "in the tradition of American Pie" which deceived me to rent this film. What I got was a bit of junk in the style of Jackass, with the major difference that compared to this Jackass, the movie looks like a citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret having rewarded other movies with 1 in 10, because now I can not go below. This gives the impression that some bad movies look like cinematic feats. <br /> <br /> I turned it off after 45 minutes and it's something I do very rarely. But it was too simple, boring, stupid, uninteresting and useless. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people reward that with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? To let you fall on your head when you were only a child? Or was it the very first movie you saw, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and have you ever thought about the chest? Something is wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this one. Even if you want a simple movie that does not require reflection, choose something else, otherwise you will regret it for sure.
