Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter carve intricate details into a piece of mahogany. The Brando game is the ONLY thing that makes this film visible. The plot is insane and laughable (not comical). The other big actors seem desperately trying to give the characters they describe a minimum of humanity ... These characters have the humanity of the wet cardboard. Everything about the technical aspect of this film is either mediocre or simply awful. The director takes pictures in still and slow motion with complete impunity. The incidental music is caricatural and destroys any trace of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was a lot different. The venerable Brando could not concentrate on the horrible rags in which he had put it. I've heard this film called "David Lynch-Esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... it's neither one nor the other. David Lynch's films are the result of boundless creativity - this film was by no means creative. And do not confuse irreverence with stupidity.
