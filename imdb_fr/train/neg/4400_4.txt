One of Frances Farmer's first films; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a remarkable voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its day, is really lame today. Roy Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion, this only applies if you are a fan of Frances Farmer and maybe a Bing Crosby fan.
