Apparently, The Mutilation Man tells the story of a man wandering the land with self-harm demonstrations to cope with his violent childhood. I use the word "apparently" because, without listening to the commentary of director Andy Copp (which I did not have at my disposal), nor to read the film before watching it, the viewers will have no idea what it's about. Gorehounds and extreme movie fans may be encouraged to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of hard splash scenes and disturbing footage from real life, but unless they are as fond of pretentious and headaches Experimental theater, they will find it a real chore to cross. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of naughty images accompanied by discordant sounds, dreadful music and incomprehensible dialogues, this dreadful heckling is the perfect way to test your sanity: if you still have all your balls, you'll turn them off and look at something decent instead (I looked at it, but I'm well aware that I bark completely!)
