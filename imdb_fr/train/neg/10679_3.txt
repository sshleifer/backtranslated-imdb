I did not expect a film as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it seemed like this movie was made for television and did a mediocre job at best. The (good) cast could not hide the fact that the plot was too predictable and that the actors had to fight (they really do their best, I think) through their bad script lines, giving their characters rather flat extras. When I watched the movie, I felt I had seen almost all of it in other (better) movies. You would find car chases, big shootings, romance, twists, etc., etc. This film does not have one. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone with the Cuban character, you know who is behind all this and all the hints that are given to you ("you stand too much near the president, see it from my point of view .. ") sounds stupid. <br /> <br /> If it depended on me (and maybe it would be a good thing that it was not), I would rewrite the plot as follows: <br /> <br /> > The first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time.
