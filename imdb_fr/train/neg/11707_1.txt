This film made in 2003 for television was naturally broadcast on a women's channel. As a man, why do I even try to look at this? I do not know, but I should have my head examined. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed to give him an injustice as he does. It removes all the strength and conviction that a man could have by appealing to several boring women. The first trouble is Joyce Hyser as a wife. I could not wait for him to let it go. His revenge was stupid and stupid and very confusing throughout the film. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coolest person you ever wanted to meet. His looks did not justify our head man doing this monkey on her and his acting was so obvious that only an idiot could miss him. Certainly a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow for the slut to seduce her own husband, again played as a loser, from David DeLuise. Anthony Denison is the boss of our group of losers. He has nothing to do but look at our hero with a scowl. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not so good. At first, I thought he was a bad actor, but later, I believed. He never had the role of the ground and was repetitive throughout. Although, as a man, I became furious when the two women managed to escape. Men, beware of this chain that belittles men and allows women to get away with murder. LMN is the chain. You must beware. Note: After looking at this a second time by mistake, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially about the author / director, Simon Gornick. I still believe he has dishonored the male species and should be flogged on horseback. Tembi Locke is the only rocker of this film. He does not have the chance to show his talents with the terrible actors of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise. Plus the stupid plot that only makes things worse. Down with Gornick's movie and her vacant stars. Please, LMN no longer shows this banality.
