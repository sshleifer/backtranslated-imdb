a documentary interpreted / manipulated in one of the darkest places in guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe place ... but sad, a bunch of sex workers has the chance to play in a football team, reunited for a week that does not seem to be longer! The main purpose of the documentary is to prove that society rejects this type of "women workers", even if no solution has been made to these poor women, except that the people who have documented them have made it a reality. kind of "stars" (as the title says) in exchange for being exploited to make this reality a documentary. however, it has its own documented reality ... but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main storyline. I would not accept to see him again; but I would recommend it only for cultural purposes.
