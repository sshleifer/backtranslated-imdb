I read the other comment about this movie, and I usually try not to be severe in my reviews because I try to be a nice person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and it's a lot of bad USA Network plus Cinemax nights.) Anyone who has thought about this movie should be prevented from ALWAYS doing another one. This film disgusted me like never before. I REALLY think these people are crazy. Just save your time and do not watch this movie. Please - I wish I had. The acting is horrible, the plot (which plot) is STUPID and degrading and crazy. I really do not think it should have been turned into a movie. But that's my opinion and I'm trying to avoid you wasting your time.
