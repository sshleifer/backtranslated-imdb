I'm a big science fiction fan of the '50s, but it's not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural vehicle for a classic sci-fi movie, the director relied too much on making the film. It is clear that he worked without money, because the whole film is loaded with puffy dialogues which drag on. I have * never * seen so much murder of time in a movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob sequences" throughout the movie, and most of the others are people engaged in a lot of poorly written, run-on dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but damn ... how could a casting cast believe that good thinking would believe it when they were teenagers?
