H.B.'s remake Halicki's classic 70s hunting movie is simply awful. With Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds is the ultimate car chase film. The remake takes the original and puts it on his head. While Halicki gave us 75% car chases and 25% drama, in GISS 2000 we have 25% in car chases and 75% in drama series. Cage as a super man, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV editions, boobs and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live until his baby (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the movie '74') was degraded in this way.
