I was very excited about the creation of this series in 2005. The principle was simple and attractive: each episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a famous horror director. Then, when I finally looked at them, it was a little disappointing. Good episodes emerged from this first season, but overall it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve and thought that season 2 would be much better. <br /> <br /> My boy, I had a shock. At least the first season has had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat" with the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total and total loss for me. The episode "Sounds Like" could very well be the worst thing I've watched on TV in the last 10 years, and most other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 will change that next year, but I do not hold my breath.
