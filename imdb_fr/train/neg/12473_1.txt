It's probably one of the worst films I've ever seen, everything is weak and inconsistent. The acting is absurd, the costumes even more delicate and the story non-existent. This adventure and anti-poverty movie was supposed to capture some of the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but it gives us no reason to follow. The main character is lukewarm and dull, he can not even fight with a sword and this one dates from the 16th century. All the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music that is played every time they ride. Do not even bother with this shit.
