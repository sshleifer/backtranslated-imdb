Director F.W. Murnau wisely stands by silent film support that he knew so well to cover the life story of islanders in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and the daily activities of the inhabitants of the island are interesting to watch. The film, however, loses momentum as it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The scenario is never so interesting, despite the fact that Murnau handled the file well. Won an Oscar for best photography, though this award should probably have been about the best landscape. You can not really credit the DP for filming in such a beautiful place.
