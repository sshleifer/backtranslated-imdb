This film makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood's costume instead of a human boy in probably not-Robin-Hood costume and he ignores all the personalities that matter in him. This movie makes Wendy a talkative idiot. And poor Captain Crochet a TOTAL clown. And of course, as each Disney cartoon must have a character who has had too many shots in the head, they have made one of the Lost Boys that one. The only character who has not been disgraced in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? The beloved parents do not even have time to see that their children are gone !!! Probably one of the most significant points of the original story and they ruined it! In addition, the famous scene of the manger between Peter Pan and Wendy is a beautiful piece. There are no thimbles or tassels - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It's a miracle that he even lost his shadow and she helped him stick it. (Even to his shoes and that makes no sense to me.) <br /> <br /> It's illegal to drop such a story like this, just to entertain the kids. Know now if you do not know him yet. This version of Disney has nothing in common with the original story. It's not really a children's story, but a very beautiful story. <br /> <br /> This just makes me angry.
