My girlfriend chose this one; As a South American born and raised in the South, I found the plot and the premises of this film without any credibility. Believing that racial and racial prejudice would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally foreign to Ante-Bellum South. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they had a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who is south knows better) to participate in this shit
