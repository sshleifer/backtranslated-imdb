This is the kind of film on which everyone involved should be embarrassed. Bad staging, high-level actor and conspiracy that continues for no other purpose than to show violence. When I saw this for the first time, I thought it might be a satire of the media and it showed violence, but it is not. I do not know what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone is doing his worst staging of all time. From scenes in which Woody Harrelson's face is transformed for no reason or the dreadful performance of Robert Downey Jr in the role of Wayne Gale, who is a journalist who seems totally crazy, this film is simply a mess.
