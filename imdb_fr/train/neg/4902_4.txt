Almost in the same league as the rather atrocious colors of Yonfan, Spider Lillies makes it clear that you can do cutting-edge cinema without the sharpness or much less sharpness. It is a Taiwanese film that is now becoming a novelty at an alarming rate, but even more so, we can find very few remarkable things here. <br /> <br /> You should know. Spider Lillies is also a lesbian themed story, but in all respects it's nothing more than a plastic ploy to attract easily seduced and gullible people. In many respects, here we have a rehearsal of the recent release of his compatriot Eternal Summer. Then, it was the gay men who received the substitution treatment, we now have the same thing with women. Zero Chou presents, for your non-existent edification, a story likely to tickle at most a girl of fifteen years. They managed to maintain a certain position of the art house, but in the end, this resulted in a most uninteresting incursion, simply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The angle of Hong Kong comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here with its most butch. Although quite friendly in her previous jobs, Isabella in Spider Lillies is apathetic and lacking in most departments. Either his heart was not there, or the entire lesbian theater program did not appeal to his sensitivity. <br /> <br /> She makes a shy, lonely and responsible tattoo artist from Taipei responsible for a younger brother with intellectual disability. , played by John Shen, who happily grants the film his only redemptive spy-related feature. The character of Isabella, strangely named Takeko but originally from Hong Kong, soon joins Jade, an unhappy young man (Rainie Yang from Meteor Garden). She lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances for being left behind by her parents and for life in general. Of course, the grandmother component works well and is touching, but otherwise, Jade as a protagonist is just as immobile as his counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and many anxieties poorly covered. as a webcam girl while Takeko maintains his father's heritage alive with a unique tattoo depicting a lilly spider sporting his arm. Jade also wants to acquire this design, which takes Takeko to explore the internal feelings of the problem through flashbacks and a rather minimal speech with the courageous Jun. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little talk on which to write, Is sexual intercourse memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to be the bad guy near the end, but as Eternal Summer reminded us not so long ago, there is a gap measured in light-years between showing sexual content and making people believe to ticket buyers that they are about to see it. <BR/> <br /> This cynical build of expectations seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak story, a humiliating role-playing game and a general shortage of relics to take away from the theater with you, this makes Color Blossoms look beautiful, think about it. At least we had some of Teresa Cheung's mammaries. No, Spider Lillies is not an audiovisual masterpiece and should be part of the GLB film festival's playlist, even the most mundane and timid. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for a pseudo-indie release, even the soundtrack and cinematic images of inspiration. It's just as good, because it makes it much easier for Spider Lillies. Believe it, avoid it and you will not miss anything. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
