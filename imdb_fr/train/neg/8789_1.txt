I watched this one on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile while this awful movie unfolded. Whenever you think it can not be worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrible. the plot is meaningless. The title "cold revenge" in the American DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. During the dialogue, there are many errors indicating that there is no intention to make another take to at least try to make this film bearable. I do not remember seeing a movie worse and I sometimes have a bad one - well, with the exception of unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, I'm kidding, while it's bad, Unstoppable deserves the Best Oscars Award for this shit.
