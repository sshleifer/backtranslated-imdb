Antonioni's films have aged badly. What has always amazed me about them is that beyond an undeniable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "evil capitalist" who wants to sing it in "La notte", or Monica Vitti laughing peasants flirting in the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I examined yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film, there are many beautiful elaborate shots of Rod Taylor's office, Los Angeles streets and highways, commercials, deserts, etc., that show the author's fascination with his journey to the States. -United. although Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, many leftist hippie clich√©s spoil the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, flies a plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something different". - The frames of the gray suites talk all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the "women objects" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - The couple of middle-class caravans speak, in front of the beauty of nature, of the construction of a hotel and its profitability. - Last but not least, many couples make love in the desert. What a platitude hippie! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "The Adventures", we can see that the king is naked and his films (except "The amiche" and maybe "Grido") are just a handful of aesthetics and commonplaces.
