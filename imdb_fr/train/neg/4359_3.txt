Wow, after ransacking the Timo Roses disk "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than meaningless swearing ... I guess some people just do not understand), this movie interested me. I read some pretty positive things and the packaging and look of the movie seemed a long way from the total basket I was expecting after Rout city. <br /> <br /> Surprise: the film is not a total basket but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of German Horror / Splatter cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and others. This means that "Barricade" is partly extremely bloody and detailed. The gore FX are not really credible but OK, the acting is correct but in some cases it's bad. The hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not get better until it's shot. So, what's the problem ... the movie is gore, has a typical German underground vibe (including the classic blood shots in the blood), OK FX and a modern feel to the way of the already promised packaging ?! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is total BS. You get a typical hillbilly / lost story in the woods with guys and girls camping and meeting a degenerate hillbilly family. Everything leads to scenes of torture / mutilation and seems incredibly random and useless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" not enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of camera work (I loved the repetitive cut of tweezers in the prolonged booby torture scene ... either they have no material, either that the publisher works in a hardware store). Worse still, the editing is one, although it is modern and much better than many other films of the genre, but RANDOM. You have an excessive use of this typical exposure effect everywhere and without meaning ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there is a grainy / noisy film look that is also thrown here and there for fun, I do not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the effects mentioned above, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most victims are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. It's OK once, but here it's boring and fake, especially towards the end. Annoying also attributes the "music" that is used continuously without any modification of the background. It does not take long for the film to become difficult to endure. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this film (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splashy movie with Trashy, feel it's silly to polish it with special effects and a new school fixture. Looks like they take it too seriously. It's not fun because decent Gore FXs are simply wasted in this context. And where conventional gore FX is acceptable, computer effects in scenes like the one that grips the mouth or the shots in the end are pretty ridiculous (and splashing in 3D loses me even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists). <Br/> <br /> I have often wondered if the era of splashing movies was over and that "Barricade" was just another example. It might be time to put it in the grave. It's not fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. The script is a cheap test on "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" driving absolutely nowhere. You can take that literally ... the end is just there and as random as so many other things here ("I love you" in a splashing movie ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to integrate many things and fails ... you can fast forward in this movie for a complete film of unblocking, acidic face cast, pinch nipple and classic 13th style couple's stabbing while fingers in a crazy tentayay!). But it's really hard to cross that. Total failure especially because you can see that it could have been something.
