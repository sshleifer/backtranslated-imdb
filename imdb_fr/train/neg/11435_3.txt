I would have liked to know more about this movie when I rented it. I put it in my tail based on Heather Graham and her strong acting reputation (IMHO). While some parts of the film were charming, much of the film seemed artificial, undeveloped, or otherwise boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people who thought the brothers were a couple ... I do not care about the size of the story, it always felt a bit ... disgusting. And for a zoologist, Charlie certainly does not seem very sensitive to the signals of other Homo sapiens. What made her crazy (apart from her passion and some common interests)? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. Highlights - Molly Shannon (though I agree with the reviewers who found her annoying on occasion), the drag driver and the dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such big dancers, I would have liked to see more, because the tracks that were shown to us were actually better than most other movies, could have been better.
