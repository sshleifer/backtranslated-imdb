Take an original SciFi movie and shuffle some alternative / revisionist story and you'll get "Aztec Rex". Apparently, Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had first to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion. This is the meaning of the film. Given the plot, it could have been really nil; the fact that it is only a little sucked is a blow to the writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Alex Rose playing Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs seem to be played by a wholly Hawaiian ensemble. Aside from that, the T-Rex (s) look pretty pretty, though every time one of them gets shot, it just rains. And they die too easily. I guess if a T-Rex was in real life, it could probably be shot down or at least hurt by rudimentary weapons dating back to the 16th century. But that removes something from the movie. There are also some graphic scenes of human swallowing of T-Rex, which is surprising, but in this context, I thought they worked well. There is a lot of action and the colonization angle is still present but does not exceed the angle of the dinosaurs, unlike the other recent movie about SciFi Original dinosaurs "Warbirds". Overall, a mediocre film (but decent by SciFi Original standards) deserves only 4.
