The acting was awful, as was the script. It was badly put in place and almost made you want to laugh at the different scenes of murder perpetrated terribly. The end was even worse. Everyone was still dying, but the end gave the impression that everything was perfectly fine! They did not tell the story of the professor's obsession, etc. The film needed more time to perhaps develop a better script. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel pretty bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made it into an OK movie, but the storyline and the acting game have failed miserably.
