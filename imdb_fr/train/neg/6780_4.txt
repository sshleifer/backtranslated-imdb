This film was a critical fiasco and box office in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a play - which failed Broadway. The story tells of some naval officers on leave in San Francisco during the Second World War. They have 4 days off that they spend at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The movie winds a lot and none of the characters really seems real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in the fields of comedy and drama - but here he plays a wheeler reseller role and he does not really succeed. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was originally scheduled to play alongside Grant, but had other commitments - so Suzy Parker intervened. She had never acted before, but was America's preeminent photographic model at the time. I think she did a good job, given the pressure she was under. Grant's twinning with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenes did not really work. The studio was trying to give him some class playing with Grant - but the character had no substance.
