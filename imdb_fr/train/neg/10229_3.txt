I am based on the sighting of an episode I saw last night (27/09/06). I do not think I will look again. The acting game was totally wood, the plot totally predictable, the end totally unrealistic - I mean, who would believe a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a convalescent recovering addict? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - he may have realized how bad the writing was !! I realize perfectly that the drama proposed this season is rather mediocre, but they can surely find better writers. Maybe they outsource writing in India or China !! I bet we will not see this one next season!
