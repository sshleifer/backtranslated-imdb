OMG, it was the most painful experience of my life watching this. I could even finish what happens to Nick. Their best thing with Nick is Drake and Josh. The children's songs are a bit boring and the kids too. My little sister wanted to watch the show because she liked everything that came from Disney or Nick, but after she finished watching the show, she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen. 'so boring'. My little brother has actually fallen asleep, I envy him. In short, if your 3 years without brain activity, you will enjoy this show otherwise change channels now.
