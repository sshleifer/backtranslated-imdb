Vampire cyborgs dominate the world and use the blood of humans as fuel. However, a renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) will face Lance Henriksen and Gary. Daniels (Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous film) Of all the questions left unanswered by this horrible film, the most poignant is Who had the idea to make the country singer Kris Kristofferson a cyborg warrior capable of giving. No, do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something, but not like a cyborg. Strangely, it is suspected that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do it. However, despite the disastrous cast, Kristofferson is by far the most enjoyable thing in the film. He gives a much more human performance than the inexpressive Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) Despite the bad diffusion, Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is falling and Gary Daniels is lost, but in the end, Knights is a bewildering failure. You go back in horror and wonder who the devil thought was a good idea on paper. (This is a film where dismembered Kristofferson fights a robot in a backpack) Worse, everything ends in a sequence of "if", fortunately, it has not yet materialized even though I still have nightmares as to the probability of such an event. br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
