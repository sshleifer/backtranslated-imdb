I would like to say that unlike many people who hated this movie and found it impossible to understand, I was quite capable of understanding it for what it is. A very incoherent attempt to plot a plot. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw this word, but in this case, it's fine. The director first presents the material in an extremely arrogant way and, worse still, extremely incoherent. It is incoherent in the sense that it presents the material in a disordered order, suggesting that the director was too drunk to remember the scenes that go first, and arrogant to the extent that, after 2 hours, they are waiting for us, the viewer of CARE at the end. <br /> <br /> I respect surreal cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a world more than real that is not related to real life) But there is nothing surreal about a story being placed in ordinary modern times and in a modern setting , which is the most important of not being able to engage the public. but in addition, it is simply a series of misplaced events that are barely connected. The most accurate way to describe the viewing experience of this film is to watch a story. perhaps even a very good story, based on a book, but frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments or connect any means of coherence. <br /> <br /> Compare stylistic cinema. Compare "Alone against all" of Gaspar Noe to that. He told us a story that is coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually profound. This film offers no intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director has finally abandoned the essential art of quality storytelling and all we have left is a waste of events hardly join. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, it is possible to make sense of things .... in a POINT. But as I said earlier, the viewer will reach a stage where it will suffice to say "Who cares". It's as if you're looking at the dull, mundane story of a man going to a supermarket to shop in a non-chronological order. Even with murders, it's totally uninteresting and without commitment. Nowadays, too many people give a high score to something they are unable to understand or understand simply for fear of appearing ridiculous, and this film is in every way intended to make the viewer ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, then watch this movie, please, considering what I said. It's a story based on a book that could have been presented MUCH more effectively and that's my final reasoning.
