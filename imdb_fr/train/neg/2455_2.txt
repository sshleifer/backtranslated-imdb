I remember seeing the movie in the summer of 1978 with my parents and being pretty at a time. Of course, I was seven years old at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the release of Jackson movies, my wife and I rented this movie because she had never seen it before and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <Ralph Bakshi ran out of money halfway through the animation process of this film and was forced to cut the angles of this production drastically. Since this film was made mainly with rotoscopy, the animation technique for people with limited budget, it says a lot. Much of this film is an animation only in the vaguest sense of the term. There are scenes that are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with perhaps superimposed animation effects. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the film "is already a compression of" The Community of the Rings "and a part of" The Two Towers "- has been reduced even more.What you get is a little like a movie version of the notes from the cliff of books. <br /> <br /> That's not all bad, however, the animation brings a warmth that is lacking to my taste in the Jackson movie It's good to imagine what it could have been with decent financing. <br /> <br /> This film also deserves attention for its sequel that never happened. a half-hour, half-hour television special was broadcast in order to close the film, all I'm going to say about it is that it was a musical .
