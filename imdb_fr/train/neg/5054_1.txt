We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: an idea that few people could question. The friends and family of these, as well as others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center, may be moved by this tasteless piece turned into a film. A kind, serious firefighter, but without mouthpieces, recalls what he can of colleagues lost to a deaf journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. They think about the results. He mumbles again, composes another eulogy, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that have caused the need for several thousand praises are extremely sad, but this insipid dramatization is terribly boring.
