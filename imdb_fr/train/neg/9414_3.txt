Despite the praise on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than the other war movies of the time to describe the mud, the boredom and the frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately, we come out thinking that everything is what there is in this movie. There is no conspiracy and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie must have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films of the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has very little action. But this compensates with a crackling dialogue and a psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a brief battle segment (entitled "City Besieged" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. Admittedly, this is one of the fastest and most convincing fighting scenes of any war movie. But alas, the rest of the movie is not worth watching for this climax. Another detour is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be a "romeo", but comes from a pervert. On the other hand, Sgt. Warnicki is a nice man, even if he is defective. As he told Captain Walker (Mitchum) when he volunteered for another patrol: "Every step forward is one more step ... at home." But this last step ?? a patrol too many? leads him to the edge of the mental chasm. Too bad the rest of the movie does not do justice to some small touches. As for Meredith's representation of Pyle, she is practically in a coma.
