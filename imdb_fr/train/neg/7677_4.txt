I stopped looking lost at this episode because I thought the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby were useless and really depressing. Then I discovered that they had kept Libby in the corner to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show for the first season, but it definitely declined the second season. I found the little religious quarrel of Jack and Locke boring. The death of the Rodriguez & Watros characters was the final straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode a 4/10, which is the end of my viewing of this great series created by Alias ​​Legend, J.J. Abrams. I hope his series in the future will improve this one.
