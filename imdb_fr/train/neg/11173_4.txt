If it was not for the bad dialogs and script. I mean, the direction was really in touch with the subject. The actors did well to give life to their characters. But in the end, what was really missing was a solid script to assemble all the pieces. I strongly suggest not to look at this. Unless you are a fan of Al Pacino like me and I watch everything he plays. Even if the result is rather mediocre lately. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad film for this actor who knew how to choose the roles.
