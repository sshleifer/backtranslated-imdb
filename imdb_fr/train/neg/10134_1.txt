Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar-nominated, but with each release they get worse. <br /> <br /> It starts with the fact that Seagal is taken over by the FBI because he killed some people "in self-defense", he is The active army is saved from prison to save a plane stolen stealth that will be used by the cliche 'nasty English villain' which Hollywood is so obsessed with the inclusion of these days. <br /> <br /> So much to say that the film has a terrible dialogue that is almost always delivered with a heavy cheese filling and a lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it that make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story, the characters of the film as a whole, such as the interaction ' lesbian 'between the two main women of the casting who is there. simply so that the titillation can attract the viewers and yet it is not even a source of confusion, because it makes no sense to know why it happened when it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with a bad dialogue, delivered by mediocre actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes, as well as irrelevant parts that serve only to realize the impossible and to aggravate the film. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life, even if you are the most ardent fan of Seagal.
