I hated how Mrs. Perez described Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghettos - and we speak Spanish - and not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for the uneducated people you met. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is economically better off than any other Caribbean island! I am happy that we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of any American influence? Free in real poverty, not the level of American poverty. We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestors include strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with black Americans (I do not do research). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King might not be further back. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man who lived a day when we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create the Cuba that is today, is that why Cubans-filled boats risk their lives to come to America - because Che has created such a place for them? You had a brilliant but brilliant idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things we can be proud of as people - do not shame our people by victimizing us. I am not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your point of view. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have been able to achieve many of my goals in America. If there is a second part in the future - less politics plus more history more stories of triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
