Like 'First Blood', it tries to convey the treatment of Vietnamese veterans, but there is really not much time for this between monotonous shootings, burns, stab wounds, torture and explosions like an incredibly indestructible Rambo from Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles and anything he can call a rocket launcher. The only woman in the middle of all these boys' toys disappears quickly, allowing testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the scenario to escalate into a succession of loud noises. Jerry Goldsmith cleverly provides some used musical signals: he carefully checks all the clich√© themes, from Russian rat-to-tat to Chinese ching-chang-chong, in case we do not really understand who we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him.
