This is the kind of thing that thrills the movie earlier. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that real men are not watching anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say here. The camera pattern as a voyeur was not new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "bicycle thief"? Or what's going on at Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> All we get is the extended metaphor of the miner like Truffaut, who spends his free time "screwing his eyes" in the cinema, destroying discipline in schools of plagiarism (the many small flights), and finally escapes the confines of society to make "his own film". Sorry ... been there, done that too many times for it to count.
