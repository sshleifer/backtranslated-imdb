This film started in a very promising way with the story of a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who has to help him. However, somewhere in the middle, it seemed that the writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable event followed the other (Russia must be very small because they all clash with each other all the time), the motivation of the main female character is understandable (why the following- she's still after they get off the ship, why does she not try to borrow a cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (the story with the mother and the boyfriend was she supposed to be funny and what was the story with the younger sister?). Despite all this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film has managed to be totally predictable. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the movie was good, the graphics and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were also good. So, it could have been a very good movie ... but it was not.
