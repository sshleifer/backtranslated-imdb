How best to express my feelings about this film: hideous? a headache? lack of consistent writing? stupidity? Try all the above for this parody. And that just for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I guess there is a story. Two silly blondes are looking for a job after hitting a plane on a golf course. They are confused with a "killer of the world" (sarcasm) and are "engaged" by two "gangsters". It is thought that "going out" means a date, and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of. And of course, the turtle sanctuary for the fart turtle, which they build with casino winnings. <br /> <br /> Does this seem funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but it's not. The filming sequences are not well done. I saw better filming in Hong Kong movies. The visuals are average for a film of the late 80s. But the problem is that it is a film of 2007. <br /> <br /> It's not worth looking again. He still does not beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie of the early 80's as the worst film ever, but again, this film is one of a kind. "F"
