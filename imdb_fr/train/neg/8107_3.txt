This movie is pretty boring. Snatches of bare flesh are thrown in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake, but they do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a masterful job in treating her character, but Day-Lewis confuses most of her lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film that. Inconsistencies in the twists between domestic household / marriage problems and political crises are mismatched. The attitudes of the characters change without explanation. Badly disjointed.
