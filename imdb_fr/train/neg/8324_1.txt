First of all, the big actors named must need money ... The surgical scenes were laughable .... and they must surely know that people who have a little knowledge in medicine would find that quite absurd. ..... Anesthetists. do not leave the room during a heart transplant ... and do not do surgery in a tiny room without instruments, cardiac lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... that could not not focus on the story because of all the stupid surgery scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the doctor doc who comes in and takes over ... it's not a thinking adult movie ... In addition, the budget had to be limited ... the street scenes were acceptable but who was the technical advisor ... It looks like the film was made by a total idiot .. Save your money and wait until he goes out on DVD and does not rent it ..
