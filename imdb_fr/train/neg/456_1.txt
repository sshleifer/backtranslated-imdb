Add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and an "assembly", a flamboyant singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing choir and the Mills brothers - it only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Despicable burlesques of "nigger" artists, who often appear in movies as parodying themselves and their race. Although "Negro comedy" may have been accepted in her day, she is extremely shocking today and I doubt she was ever funny. Although I would not have been offended, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, though, I might not have understood some of these things.
