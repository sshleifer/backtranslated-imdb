When I glimpsed the title, I thought we were going to have another hip-hard slasher, but in fact I found that "7eventy 5ive" was slightly passable, and that almost 80 years after a tedious comeback in the middle of the section, he wins momentum for the last half-hour leading to his scandalously capricious climax and his true cop end. It will not win a prize for its originality, because it is as systematic as possible and steals its thunder in the form of thrills (sensations of usual cheap jumps), place (isolated dwelling) and motivation of other films. The direction is brilliant, and the material is riddled with poorly made red herrings in its complicated scenario and fragile script. Sometimes ludicrous, but nonetheless I was entertained mainly because of his brutal and frightful acts of luscious violence against rather obnoxiously boring students from a psychotic murderer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a brave young cast, but the characters they described were not particularly appealing. Rutger Hauer, still present, appears in a brief supportive role as a grizzled detective. A slender addition, but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold.
