In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to the screening of this film a few months ago and I was quite disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate the fact that the director made a film about the men of the 442nd subject that deserved to be addressed in the film industry, playing in some parts of the film was rather outdated. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all excellent. However, the director should never have put himself as the main character of the film. Sorry Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stick to what you are good at: the theater. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role, and her appearance was unfit to play the role of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were not they chosen for this role? Another major problem with this movie was its action sequences. Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to fight German soldiers ... let alone anyone. True, it was a low-budget feature film, but since it was a war movie, is not it important to show battle scenes? This film was a laudable attempt, but certainly did not deserve a major distribution.
