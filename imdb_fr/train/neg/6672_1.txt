I am 47 years old and have spent most of my life, a fan of horror movies and science fiction. Whether they are silent, in black and white, without budget or big budget, there are very few for which I can not find anything that could please. That said, I'm going to attribute to this movie the merit of its good effects of gore and creature, but that's all. This is a case of effects on history. The truth is that we live in a time when there are very few things left that have not been seen in a horror movie. Therefore, for a film, whatever it is, to be really entertaining, it must have a good original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is a bad movie. This film does not even have a good acting, only good effects. So, unless you can talk about gore, pass this one.
