Saw a trailer for that on another video, and decided to rent when he came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (apart from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I do not care about the characters, other than really wanting to see Nora's husband get beaten up. The role of Christopher Walken is so deplorable, what teasing!
