This film was made by a group of whites who went to school together. Well, there is nothing wrong with that except that it was done by a group of whites who went to school together. 90% of the actors are white men of the same age. It's almost like watching a group of guys at the boys' camp turn against themselves. The film has no plot. He simply repeats the same blood bath action after a bloodbath. There are funny scenes and comic extracts. But they do not buy the monotony. <br /> <br /> The cartoon scenes are used to cover topics that clearly exceeded their budget or resources, and were not very successful. All that can not be done with Whites running on the blood-covered beach is done with inexpensive animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino play. The scenes in the trailer are as good as ever. The rest is just repeating the same kind of banal and inept comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets boring when the same things happen to you over and over again. It's more like a series of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a kind of comedy that hits the mark. I can see where the plot idea is intriguing. But in this post-apocalyptic film, America looks a lot like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says that the story ideas came from that time. He plans to do part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe parodic. <br /> <br /> At the opening in Los Angeles, Wheatley announced that he would bring back about the same cast in Part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the next , to which he replied: yes, of course.
