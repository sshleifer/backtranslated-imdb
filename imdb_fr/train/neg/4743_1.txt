I'm back in your local mall (of course, because that's where high school students meet !!!!!) to demonstrate how "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" is really awful !!!!! To prove how bad this DCOM joke is ... <br /> <br /> ... we'll take these four sumo wrestlers and stuff them into this photo booth. How ... comfortable !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How is it terrible ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel is losing its money, again, with these exciting and decisive 10-second promos, which allows viewers to wonder: And then, all of a sudden, when it works, for once, this not only got a higher TV rating than usual, but it was only seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once everyone !!!!! In addition, this film talks about high school and all that, and trust me, I will not go further with what is there ..... <br /> <br /> Say .. smile! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. 0/10
