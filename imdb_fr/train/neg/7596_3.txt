A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, seems like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less the content, which will give more creativity to the actors, the writers and the director. <br /> <br /> But why is this film so bland? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This film immediately assumes that we are deeply invested in the characters. You never give a story to anyone, so you never know why the characters act as they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations about physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if there is one left left at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie and found it awful. <br /> <br /> His question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save him?" My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's ass could not save him."
