Okay ... so I saw a lot of really strange / unusual movies in my day. The fear and disgust in Las Vegas come to mind when I think of that. Well, more now ... from now on, whenever someone asks me, "Hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I am going to say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, it was obvious that it would be one of those "tr√©py camera effect" movies. By that I mean small things like blinking images on the screen, rewinding and fast forwarding people's words and scenes, playing with the color of the screen, moving forward and backward constantly ... then you have the actor himself. People get violent at random, shoot at things / people, say the strangest things that just do not make much sense. <br /> <br /> The film talks about a writer who starts to mix real life with the book he has In writing and in the absence of a better way to explain it, you basically see this "journey" that he continues throughout the film. The fact is that Johnny Depp made a similar trip to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was fun to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a lot of trouble finishing Slipstream. It hurts my brain a bit. <br /> <br /> I can see a moviegoer say that this film has some cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but adds to the feeling of madness ... blah, blah, blah The fact is that this movie hurts to your brain when you look at it .... it does not make much sense, it takes all your concentration to try to understand even from afar what is happening and even in the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over ... and you can say that you've sat through! In conclusion, if you want to see a movie that will make you say "that devil" over and over, out loud and in your head, go ahead, lose an hour and 30 minutes and take a look at that. <Br /> <br /> Mr Hopkins, while applauding you as an actor and congratulating you on your choice to try your luck in the realization .... please, do not ever make a movie again like this one. Next time, try something that relies a bit more on a good storytelling than on camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache.
