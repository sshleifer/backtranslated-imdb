Certainly the product of young minds, this piece could very well please the crowd of the 20s, who always tries to find his place in the world, while being obsessed by all neuroses. However, I can not imagine that the considerable amount of narcissistic subjects looking at the navel, ordinary humor or trivial subject would particularly interest people over 30 years. , are excited by such absurd caricatures for a comic effect that they can not be told in a real way. <br /> <br /> However, we must give some points of style to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use all the imaginable editing stuff of the book to bring to life an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First of all, beware of the festival darlings. Secondly, even though we live in the YouTube era, all the stories of their mundane lives do not deserve big screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if other people 20 and older can find something to identify with, that's fine. Still, I could not help but think, at the end of this film, how this last generation, in the process of becoming major, will live in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. At the age when every child is constantly reassured about his particularity and the fact that he deserves all 15 minutes of exposure, his resilience and ability to cope with adversity does not exactly seem to be the strong point of this generation.
