LIGHT SPOILERS (but that does not matter anyway.) <br /> <br /> An exercise of gobblygook of catastrophic proportions that does not even deserve 10 lines, I have to put these remarks on the networks. This is the worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first to benefit from the late Mystery Science Theater. Although it took me half an hour to complete the expected ironic angle, it was still a mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that makes it necessary to realize that in addition to bloody and ugly masks, the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematographic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and play, editing and timing are put to use. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is not a master. Period. And no banal analysis of the easy social commentary presented here will change that. Curiously, Carpenter was never anything but a B-movie director, but at least movies such as "Fog" and "The Thing" had an extraordinary atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting. Camera angles stuck in the cement. Rhythm without tension. However, the most heinous element of this episode is perhaps the story that obviously can not be blamed on JC (unless the writers are friends of Cody.) The first minute, two minutes, a Girl crossing a forest before being almost crushed by a Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the movie. But come on, a girl rushing into a deserted forest, nowhere, in particular, desperately needing a chance abortion appointment with the advocate for a couple of women's rights doctors whose clinic is just right at the end of the road. the corner. Oh, and I will not even say that the doctor takes the injured victim into the car and accelerates from 0 to 60 seconds in six seconds. Works wonders for broken ribs or concussions. <br /> <br /> Then, things deteriorate very quickly. The empty dialogue "I just want to help you", the endless comings and goings at the portal, grandiose fighting tactics such as cutting off the phone line (in the era of mobile phones?) Followed by the shooting: again director of the Ramboesque clinic against Ron Perlman and high school high school for a few kicks at Easter. Another beautiful line: "So, what are we going to do?" of the child who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Uh, no it's not the pheasant season yet. So, who needs these teen boys anyway? What about the old, tried-and-true method of the lonely fool who makes his way through the door with his all-American SUV? <br /> <br /> Regarding the exchange of bullet scenes themselves, the cuts were as steep as the staccato of a DC cartoon. All that was missing was the titles of Wham, Bam and Whiz balloons. And all this to the sound of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode. <br /> <br /> At one point, we learn that Daddy is not really dad, but at this point we have not been paying much attention. no more. The only dramatic source of this story is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only grateful for not having twins. Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they never end up together. They remain simple abstractions for each other. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the goalkeeper, each character is absolutely unacceptable. Bland, hysterical, gloomy, macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seems to have anything medical about them. And there's that bumbling dad who hangs up his pregnant daughter as if he's the stressed boyfriend himself. He has happily had his. There are two great comic moments worthy of MST: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing came out and later the newborn lobster with her head stuck on baby's head. Angelica was also cute with the belly of her rugby ball before she finally managed to pop the little monster from hell, right to life. Regarding this daring male abortion scene ... well, they should have kept the episode of Miike and ban it instead. <br /> <br /> In short, Rosemary's Baby meets Alien is placed on the court of a player of M.A.S.H. episode. This sniffer alone, appreciable only for the under-16 generation that leaves us the permissive, will ensure, as someone else has said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. It's a shame because there have been a number of brilliant productions, including some really decent parodies like Dante's "Homecoming" or McKee's "Sick Girl". Not to mention the beautiful images of "Fairhaired Child" Malone. <br /> <br /> Sorry John Carpenter, I think your management day is over. It's time to run for the president.
