I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever, because I have not seen all the Bollywood movies, but my imagination tells me it could be. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a suicide attempt on behalf of the director, and for me, I believe he has succeeded in his mission. Apart from this film, no actor on the list would risk doing the same thing for all the humiliations that this film must bear. <br /> <br /> But do not just blame the director, he filmmaker, who seems to repeat for the prize of the best amateur director of the year. There is the dramatic score that hopes to take you to the next scene. The lighting man, who had to hold a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb on a pole in the other, hoping that the flame lighting the cigarette would add to the light if necessary in every scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everything could be forgiven here. All the actors in Aag were set up to promote a new start and a new dimension in the redesign of India's most loved film, Sholay. We must not forget that these actors were not forced to participate in this film, they are a list and a willingness to participate in something that, let's face it, would certainly have aroused great expectations of the public ??? This begs the question, Amitabh side (for the moment), the other actors really believed that their performance had even tried to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this ridiculous abomination of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course he did not do it, it was a demonstration to the public of the money that the talks can make the actors work. <br /> <br /> I really hope that all concerned are happy with this vulgar attempt to rewrite a classic movie, which manages to pollute everyone's mind when they look at the original.
