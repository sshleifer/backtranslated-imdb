You must understand that when the name of the star is incorrectly entered in the opening credits, you do not spend a good time (the credit reads as "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). A nice car chase, shoot them, make them jump if all you want is action, because the relationship to the existing plot is, at best, tenuous and totally unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially that of Gooding at the end, are worse than unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly confused. All I can think is that Andy Cheng has to be a really nice guy to involve so many good actors in this odious project (he can not have anything on everyone, does he?).
