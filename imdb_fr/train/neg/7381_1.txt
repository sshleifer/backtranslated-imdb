First, Seagal's voice is doubled for about 50% of the film ... Why? Because apparently, there was a rewrite of the script and story during the shoot and they need to change the dialogue to ensure the continuity of the story because they have several versions. From the beginning, you scratch your head, because overdubs are not only annoying, but they have no meaning. <br /> <br /> That said, the story remains nil and makes no sense. When I had the end, I scratched my head because the movie was so useless and the ending did not even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This film made me stop watching Seagal directly to video because they are getting worse.
