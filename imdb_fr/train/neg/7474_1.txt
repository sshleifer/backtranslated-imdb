This program did not do it for me, even though I'm a fan of the genre. The major factor that disappointed me was that there was not one scene that was not dominated by the main character. It made things a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the end of the program. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there because I'm not a movie critic. you must add 10 comment lines. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in each scene, and I hope the screenwriters on this show will be able to use a little more diversity to interact with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of the actors and the team is that after watching movies like "the wire", I expect great things from the police tragedy.
