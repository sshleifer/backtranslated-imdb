*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - the restorative game of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the action is awful (the atrocious script does not help him.) The culprit is the nasty Buntao, head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed at him as he expressed his "fury" at having lost a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line "it's a hostile takeover" (that's the rest of the title of this movie) has been delivered about as badly as it could be done. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has distinguished themselves in this movie. Then we come to the plot. That should tell you all you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the city center. Now she is a C.I.A. agent (or was it another government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not even remember it). Hmmm ... I can imagine what this C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What work experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay. You are engaged! I only give him a "2" because of a good acting and a nice plot at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the naughty secret, will be caught).
