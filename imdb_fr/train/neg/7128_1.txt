I am a stupid person for renting the REDLINE DVD. Chicago Pictures, who made this silly movie, has never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites, including mine whose ALEXA index is 16K. They pulled me out of the contract and now I earn $ 16,000 and lost a lot of my personal time (Peter Palisades Media report). You know who you are! movie!!! It sucks and its authors are scammers. <br /> <br /> REDLINE brings together losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
