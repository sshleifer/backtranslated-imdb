I have never read Bradbury's novel on which this movie is based, but from what I've gathered, it will be interesting (when I read it finally, I'll do it). My comments will be based solely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and I was so excited, but when I finally saw it, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself seemed so amateurish. The actors were not well chosen (although Robards and Pryce are good actors - but not here). The young actors, it seems, were simply invited to show themselves, to put on the clothes of the characters, to say the lines and to make funny faces. The set and accessories were cheap and unrealistic. The management was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the seriousness of the situation that I had to go online and check who was running it, just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and pasted and the plot (scenario) was just that too (even if the author had been involved himself, irony?). Tension, fear and suspense were so clear that it was ineffective when the climax finally arrived. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments on this movie and I can not believe that people really like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. There was so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was technically so bad that it detracted from the brilliance of the story.
