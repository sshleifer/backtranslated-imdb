Hooper is not funny, not rhythmic, not romantic and uninformative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the world's biggest stuntman would have a tragedy, there was an attempt but it did not seem real. No character study, no lessons learned, it did not even seem that the actors were really having fun, they were just trying to act as if they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to watch Burt and want to have an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancing the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor of this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to love Hooper. This film turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
