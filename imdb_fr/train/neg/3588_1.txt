The sequel to "Walking Tall" from 1973 continues the real drama surrounding Tennessee's Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this episode plays like a drama TV movie. Bo Svenson succeeds Joe Don Baker, but he is far too lenient for the role. he comes out like a traveling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui find themselves with very little to do. I would give the movie a star strictly on its good intentions, but the scenario is a transparent and lazy mass of routine problems and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the TV movie "A Real American Hero".
