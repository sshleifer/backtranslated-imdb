Pretty decent with stylish images, but the small budget hampers things. <br /> <br /> I also have the impression that they were trying to shock you with some graphic elements of the biz weird website. <br /> <br /> If you like animated movies, such as cyber-city and advertising police, you might like it. <br /> <br /> but, basically, his low-budget matrix does not give him his style. <br /> <br /> Excellent soundtrack by unpublished groups of grunge / punk / post grunge. It is worth checking if only for the soundtrack.
