I'm a little fan of Lynche's work, so I was happy to find this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It is a series of short drawings that try to show a disturbing and disgusting humor. The animation is very rudimentary, probably done with Macromedia. Each cartoon has a fat guy who beats his family and usually acts like a fool to everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. However, if you've spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, these cartoons will not be different from the other things you've seen before. Many popular amateur artists on Newgrounds do a much better job than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the website, it would blend in perfectly with the best Newground artists. But, since I saw this on DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have it otherwise. These drawings are adapted to the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I was expecting a better quality, both in history and in animation.
