I own two home entertainment stores and have seen a lot of bad movies in my day, but this one was so bad that I had to register here and make a comment. How was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover just died a month before arriving at the 'Rubber House' he had given her. Once there, she discovers that he has cheated on her throughout her relationship, but nothing seems to register her. In one day, she starts a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe), the housekeeper. Even though she is married to Dafoe off screen, her scenes with him were cold and emotionless. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Even Willem Dafoe could not save this movie from the amateur movie train wreck that he is.
