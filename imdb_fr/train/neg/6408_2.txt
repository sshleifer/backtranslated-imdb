UPA's films are surprisingly well-rated on IMDb, despite the fact that the quality of the animation is light years away from Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at its peak. Unfortunately, because of the rising costs of producing pretty high-frame comics and pretty backgrounds, the UPA style (which began around 1950) began to dominate in the late 1950s and 60. After all, the films were very inexpensive to manufacture and they had received several Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were now mainstream movies. As a result, lousy animation became the norm and this trend only reversed in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA film is one of the first. The characters are very simply drawn (any pattern and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with colors added very lightly (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the elements). <br /> <br /> As for history, it's a funny story with a strong jazz-style attitude. Some will like it, others will find it very very strong. This is the traditional story "Frankie and Johnny" and because of the filming, it's probably not a good movie for kids. Heck, because of animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good movie for me either! Some will read my article and will probably think that I am a crank (which I am, to a certain extent). However, I love animation movies and a bit of this minimalist UPA style goes very far and you can not seriously consider them as great works of art - just very quickly done drawings. Ignore the Oscars and try watching classic cartoons or something else.
