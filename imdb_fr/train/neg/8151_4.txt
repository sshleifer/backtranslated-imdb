Leslie Sands' "Deadlock" raised play becomes a bad choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing his wife, a woman accomplice receives the visit of the best friend of her husband, who pretends to be her husband when others start to stop at home. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's top directors since his heyday, is unfortunately unable to elevate this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously distant and held back until the scandalous finale (where she happily leaves all obstacles). Production and support casting strictly second-rate; only for the completers of Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
