I put this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night it was on one of the movie channels and I listened. I did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Maybe the movie will become a golden comedy after that. Given the slow pace and total lack of laughter in the first 30 days, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character begins the film in the classic "I do not know how to start my movie", with a long and boring monologue about how he does not want to be sued. It's not funny. It's not even funny. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little laugh the first time he says it. Then he pushes it into the ground, smiling at the camera as if it were the funniest thing ever written. To surpass oneself. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason I immediately hated the movie. Do not assume to know your audience. Familiarity is an achievement, a bit like respect. <br /> <br /> From there, you have a big whistling guy who speaks very effeminately about his mate life as a storm. I did not realize he was Jewish. It is a disgrace for Jewish comedians to call it "Jewish humor". It's just a funny humor. It is not because you are Jewish that you have the talent for comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytic humor than this guy, so obviously, it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If any of the items I saw had worked, I might have stuck. But some tell how much he likes the names of the women he works with, and then list them for five long minutes does not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize. on the popularity of "Office Space". Do not become a victim of targeted marketing. Just say no to "Haiku Tunnel".
