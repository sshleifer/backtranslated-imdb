First of all, I want to say that this film deserves more than the four stars that I wrote down. I gave it four stars because for me, this 86-minute film always looks like two and a half hours and is not attractive enough to hold up. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title that my DVD calls it) is better than your movie against ordinary nature. <br /> <br /> A resort in the jungle of Southeast Asia has just opened and is employing locals trying to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature seeks revenge in the form of the god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the staff of the seaside resort) have to worry about, the natives are also mistreated. <br /> <br /> This film is a story of adventure / horror quite well done with good musical direction and score. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously wrong. Some of the close-ups of his jaw are good but that should be all we need to see. Some of the underwater shots clearly show that we are dealing with a squeaky alligator toy that you can probably pick up at a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are credible, even authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the film that will give you chills, if any, but that will be shot and produced well enough to be mentioned. And like many creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. It also has a lot of good jungle landscapes. Playing is below normal, but who expected it to be better, huh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than his recent American counterpart "Primeival" but nothing to compare with "Jaws". But remember that it may not be interesting at times.
