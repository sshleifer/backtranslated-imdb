I expected it to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was really excited to see these shorts online. Well, they were not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I do not really know exactly what I do not like. I guess they are just boring. The sound bothers me, and most of the characters, though I liked Roy, the Toxic Boy, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably bothered me the most, although it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I do not like the death of certain characters either. For example, Match Girl set fire to the gas station or the death of Girl Who Stares in general. Roy's death was amusing, surprisingly. Died by a car cooler. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> Some things are not suitable for children. Just a little bit of language and gore. That's about all I have to say! 3/10
