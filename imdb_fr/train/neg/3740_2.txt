Right away, this movie was ridiculous. It's not that he did not have a redemptive aspect ?? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beauty of the background. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the south does not have beautiful mountains like those in the west. I knew it was Utah from the start, but maybe Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to apologize that it was a southern city. Subverting his accent in a southern accent was easier. Of course, the film has twists, but its sense of dummy localization was something I could not go beyond. It's not like Utah does not have a meth lab ... so why did the writers think it was necessary to pretend it was in the South? <br /> <br /> Another thing in action pictures always leaves me puzzled. Why do they always have the sound effect of "arming" when the character pulls out an automatic handgun? It seemed that all the other sound effects of this movie were a "chuk-chich" meaning that a 9mm was loaded and ready to be triggered. Of course, the weapons had already been armored, which was useless. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics were far too advanced. But hey, this movie was for a certain "market segment", I guess ... It's a shame. Each of the actors can play, but this film was nil.
