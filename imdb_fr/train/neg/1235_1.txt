I could not wait to see The Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The sets and masks are excellent, but this is the only positive aspect of the film. All the other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he's just in the movie, he looks stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: the monkeys are lying unconsciously on the ground, but humans do not attack them, no, they wait until they are raised again! This is just one example of this stupid story, but it would be too long to tell them everything.
