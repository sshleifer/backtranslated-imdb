STAR: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name becomes synonymous with character in The Simpsons) is a (usually) unorthodox cop who gets results, but who coats his superiors with something rotten. Avoiding the murder of his partner at the beginning of the film, the plot takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico, where a super secret American super tank with incredible firepower and superb capabilities. Imaging was fraudulently taken hostage, with the crew, by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This annoying (and even 80's) boring action movie was a bizarre career change for Gary Busey after making the flame-haired villain Mr Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He is just following the gestures with his cardboard character here, still so edgy and crazy (with "butthorn" his trademark for the bad guys), but without the material to support him. Henry Silva is present as a villain on the screen, but he is totally lost as an Arab leader (with a red beret!) And the horrible scenario gives him really awkward boring dialogue lines that make his performance so ridiculously dark . He's just one of the many action movie characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but can not add anything. After a boring first half without a lot of exciting action, things come back a bit late, but it's too little, too late, and none of that can be fun. *
