Sometimes creating something strange and contemporary does not always benefit everyone. Although I recognize that the scenography and concept of the film were rather interesting, the execution of these ideas in a coherent story simply did not work. This movie was so horribly slow and useless that even Robin Williams could not save that trash. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell flat, but he should have warned the rest of the world of this situation.
