When I finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on a DVD imported from Region 2, I was blown away by the way this epic zombie is entertaining. The transfer is almost immaculate , as good as ever. The gore really stands out as it should be and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and the awesome gore effect.The sound is also fantastic.It is only dolby to 2 channels, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really enjoy cheesy music (actually a very good score), as well as effective sound effects, although inexpensive. It has never sounded so good, and the excellent transfer adds to the overall pleasure. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flowed in this film, it's extremely brutal with explosive head shots, mega-buttons filled with puss, a chopper at the throat a zombie, some extremities burned by a woman (why not burn the guy too), intestinal nibbling, baby zombies and much more i lost track. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a fan for Zombie Action Madmen, especially Italian. There are great sets and a cinematography to find, I think people do not give it enough credit, if you see a blank copy, not a horrible pirate copy, it's a whole new experience. <br /> <br /> This film never lets pass a second, and I realize that it is an incoherent plot, the dubbing is horrible, the acting is rigid and its sense of irreverence is celebrated fashionable, but that's part of its charm. <br /> <br /> It's for me one of the best horror movies ever, you can not do it. It's an accidental genius of the highest order.If they played it to laugh It would have been a disaster, but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a cult classic that has a formidable nose to all the traditional standards of movie making. <br /> <br /> Tons of action footage, exotic locations, great scenery, good cinematography, a wonderfully nerdy RPG, and an incoherent but always interesting plot, stunning makeup effects Pretty women can kick their ass, great music and sometimes hilarious zombies, sometimes terrifying, but always fun.How can you go wrong with everything, a cult classic that stands the test of time.
