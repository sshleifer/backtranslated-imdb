The first of the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. It is the most zero. When I sat down to watch this, I actually thought that the fourth and fifth were bad, it should be good after the terrible precedents. The boy was I was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first ten minutes of the evening, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it would get better. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a terrible movie, but it does not need a sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) have already been pretty terrible! Also, how often can you bring Freddy !? The game in this movie was awful, the script was predictable and crappy and also had flaws. The way they made Springwood was totally wrong. Pay no respect for the first at all. To add to that, the whole thing seemed really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie was "funny". This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be "funny"? I would call it miserably shit. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not this information have appeared in the first !? The end was just stupid and old-fashioned, just like the rest. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. Just show yourself. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Wes Craven created something so good at first, but it must be moved because of that trash that belongs to the trash. They should not have bothered to make this film. Neither of the other suites, except the third. The third is the only decent among all the suites. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD in itself and was not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD box I had, I would have thrown it out when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and mediocre attempt of a sequel. <br /> <br /> - a complete joke of the first movie <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this worthless crap.
