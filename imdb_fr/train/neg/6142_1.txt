Gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. But not the bad kind of bad movies. This one is so awful that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting. He should go back to gymnastics. But who can forget memorable scenes such as the chalk bar, the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene that runs through the village of idiots. I do not think it was supposed to be that bad, but who can say it? This is not art, but if you want something light and fluffy that will make a good conversation, praise gymakta. Made for an evening of fun.
