(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should figure. The DVD did not even show the time or how long it was. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I have ever seen. This one is much worse. That does not make any sense. Thrown together the plot. All this so that we can see oversized breasts on a silhouette that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It was a student movie. This musta earned a grade C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I learn that it was wrong not end.) the end made no sense <br /> <br /> Playable: 0/10
