Yes, talk about bad consequences. Rick Moranis plays the lead role in this awful sequel to "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", both funny and entertaining. The concept plays fundamentally in the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of narrowing the children and the inner house instead of the garden as a universe to explore. If you think that sounds interesting, think again. The film is at best boring, at worst embarrassing. <br /> <br /> First, the continuity of the series has been completely eliminated. The only remaining actor in the first film is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress who plays his wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, those who play the neighbors have changed, etc. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results are confusing to say the least. <br /> <br /> Second, the story is a recap of the first, without any originality. All the jokes (and almost all the jokes) and dangerous situations presented in the movie are simply copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". Third problem, special effects. I'm sure it was done on a small budget, but they are pathetic, far worse than those appearing in the rest of the series. You are supposed to admire with admiration these tiny characters who are exploring the huge domestic territory, but you will probably end up losing your temper most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth problem: locating the action inside the house is only boring. Few things happen and when they happen, they are not exciting at all. The first film was fun because the children were dealing with nature, grass and insects living there. In this one, adults (which are quite boring compared to children) are dealing with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​publishing such a mundane sequel to an already moribund series appealed to Disney executives, except perhaps because they needed to withdraw from money without taking five minutes to think about something new. I warn you: leave this tasteless trash where it should stay: put dust on the shelves of the store.
