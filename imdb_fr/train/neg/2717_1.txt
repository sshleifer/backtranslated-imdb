Do we really need more narcissistic waste for the baby boom generation? Technically, I'm a baby boomer, even though all the "idealistic young people" of the 1960s were reading Marx, burning their cards and generally prolonging a war that cost the lives of tens of thousands of people. I was still in primary school. But I remember it well, and 9 out of 10 were stupid idiots, who believed anything as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another important exercise for kids who have never really grown up.
