The soul of an old mummy is transferred to one of his disciples so that he can punish all those involved in the desecration of his grave. The soul transfer ages the young man at a frantic pace until he looks like a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from the people involved in the search. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, the curse of Pharaoh is a rather gloomy affair. Although the film presents some good original ideas (mummy sucking blood, soul transfer, interesting makeup effects, arm tear scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and the rhythm are the very definition of the market. To make matters worse, the first 15 films in the film, relatively short, last about 66 minutes and consist of nothing more than padding. I usually go for those mummy movies that move slowly, but the curse of Pharaoh even tests my patients. The casting helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot that would have liked the film to focus more on his mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. Finally, I do not know who had the idea to put the servant in the air mom in what seems to be a pajamas, but it's a ridiculous and ridiculous look for a creature that is supposed to instill fear in the public . <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about the curse of Pharaoh, I will give it a score of 4/10. Not a good note to be sure, but generous considering all the problems I have with the movie.
