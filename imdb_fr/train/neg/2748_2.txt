this film only has a second star because I work in the city center and I like to see it destroyed. the effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and always absolutely horrible makes it a huge waste of money. I rented it so as not to complain too much of what I paid, but it was a few hours that I will never come back. intrigue holes abound. terrible acting on all levels. I do not recommend wasting time watching this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to watch that, run away. I can not emphasize enough the seriousness of this film. <br /> <br /> where does the second dragon come from? why did not he show up sooner? how did they get rocket launchers on the dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
