I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised great visual effects and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very inspired by Baraka, with wide angles, very similar shots with predefined cameras to capture the long passage in each plane. Even some of the scenes were identical (the street with the traffic). While Baraka told a beautiful story, juxtaposing nature, man-made environments, spirituality and the horrors of the world, in a captivating fashion and with excellent music, this film jumped from plan to film, without any encompassing story , mediocre musical score, then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there must have been some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half the film is composed of Egypt and landscapes (it's like Arizona, but I did not bother to check). Seriously, it's horrible, praise it if you must, but do not buy it. Filmmakers should be ashamed of having shown this film.
