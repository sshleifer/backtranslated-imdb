Edward Mountain's Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play as a crime thriller with a little black film mixed to give flavor. Instead, it is a badly filmed and meaningless film in the making of low-budget and uninspired films. The plot is absurd and the actor extremely stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather lean resume in the industry, smiles and jokes around, and everyone acts with the same verve as the characters in a film made by the government on the safety of drivers. The film features shows such as "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in its unusually healthy view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer does not even have the right to see someone light a cigarette before to have interviewed a woman well made in a flop in the middle of the film. The only thing that seduces the film (aside from its brevity) are the excellent venue shots coordinated by William Steiner. The small budget of the film works in favor of the filmmaker, because the viewer is treated with well-framed images of the interiors and outdoor exteriors of New York. Unless you want to enjoy the movie for camera settings and angles, I recommend you watch almost any other movie.
