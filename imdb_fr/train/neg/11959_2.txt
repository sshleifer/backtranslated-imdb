This film is a twisted nonsense of a film, unfolding in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends up ending up with a strange and violent guest sitting right behind and watching the 4 family members at home. their worst. Nothing is sacred in this film, with sexual drugs and violence to the limit, I am surprised that he passed the censorship. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it will only appeal to those for whom we should not be encouraging, rather than any supposedly underlying message for the rest of us. A film about the worst part of society and an extreme treat anyway ... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition films.
