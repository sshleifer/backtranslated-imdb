As far as I know, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubt is whether this is the work of an ordinary guy who loves movies or a film student, because there is a reference to Porto School of Arts in the final credits. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this film a total ignorance of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn at school when you study cinema is to tell a story. You learn that, as in novels, in movies, you must also build your story in three acts: introduction, development, and conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn that this is true for a 3-hour epic, for a regular movie, for a short film, and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second ad. You also learn that your approach to the academic structure can be nuanced and that you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> By and large, TIM WATCHER introduces us to his main character, then the film ends - the whole film sounds like the introduction of the characters in AMÉLIE de Jeunet. There is no second or third act in TIM WATCHER. It's not a parody or a film of art, so you can not even try to justify the lack of respect for the academic structure. You expect to be told a story, and it does not happen. Worse than that, TIM WATCHER is defined as a warning; and a real goal. It says nothing, or at least is not valid. His point is childish, with a sense of vengeance. The situations described are extremely simple and his approach is Manichean. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot more from this short film. The film opens with a rather nice sequence of credits and you quickly realize that you are watching something with better production values ​​than the Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget of this film, but judging by the list of thanks to the end credits, thank the production team for these good relations in a country where it is difficult to open the doors to young people filmmakers. <BR /> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with a perfect score. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no conspiracy. And it's a shame because it gives the impression of a waste of production values. It is difficult to see in the Portuguese short film such a variety of locations and so many supplements available to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison may seem, I have to set a good example for BMW shorts. how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned by product placement and an elegant and delirious cinematography.
