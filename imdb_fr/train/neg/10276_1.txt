So, you may be reading some of the comments posted on this movie, and you may be saying, "Huh, there were probably a lot of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30th." The funny thing is that most of these rave reviews seem to come from the same person or, at best, from a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies. The truth, my friends, is that this film is really unassailable. It is not because he is "independent" that one obtains a free pass. If you're going to do a musical, whether on film or on stage, on Broadway or in the local theater, you probably have to make sure that (a) your actors can sing,, (c.) You have equipment decent sound, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have witty and charming words. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this one. This is one of those unfortunate movie shooting experiences where I felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.
