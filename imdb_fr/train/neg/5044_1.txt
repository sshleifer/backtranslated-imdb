I was excited to see this movie after reading a positive review in The New York Times. In addition, I am also Shangha√Øenne, so the subject did not arouse all its interest. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film's rhythm was extremely slow and monotonous. The director lingered too long on certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was almost no dialogue. Dialogue was badly needed to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the film, you did not feel any sympathy for the characters. This film lacked everything. The scenario was weak, the acting was mediocre and the editing did not exist. The director tried to imitate certain black film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one that catches your attention, keeps it, and manages to wrap it up without you feeling that time has passed. This film felt like never ending. Do not waste your money on this movie.
