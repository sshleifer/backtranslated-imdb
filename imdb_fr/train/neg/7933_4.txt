I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is a failure. Everything has an impression of staging, false sounds and sound scenes, with a rear projection really horrible. He has a good idea of ​​the plot that the scriptwriter has managed to bury in an insignificant script, which prevents the audience from delving into the action and actually worrying about the characters. The staging is pedestrian and only accentuates the gravity of the scenario instead of helping to improve it. I have already seen a lot of "sound productions" very nice, but it's not one of them. All that it does is that you enjoy even more Scott / Boetticher movies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, neat and shines a thousand dollars. It is always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. Besides Scott, the other main reason I wanted to watch this film was that I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, "Rocky Mountian". In "Man Behind the Gun", she is just as beautiful and we can say that she is a good actress, but she was forced to say some nice silly lines and the blocking given by the director was really horrible. I only saw Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific", and he plays exactly the same character here ... an arrogant pain that you want to beat until you lose consciousness. I guess that proves he's a good actor ... he made me hate. There are lame attempts at comic relief that only hurt the film, in my opinion. Although there are a lot of elements to hit, I must say that I really enjoyed enjoying the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but that's not why we're going to see the movies from Randolph Scott, is not it? <br /> <br /> There are certainly Scott's worst movies, and this one is certainly not unbearable, but he certainly could not be considered mediocre either.
