I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I feel that the director / screenwriter is only joking with the audience: "let me see how much emptiness can you support (public)". The dialogues are empty, ... the scenario is minimalist. In a few moments, photography is really nice. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's hard to really laugh during this "comedy". I made fun of watching the movie until the end. If you manage to rise above the fiasco of this director, you will discover the good interpretation of some legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and the very good performance of the son of Emir, Stribor Kusturica. <br /> In short: too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make first-rate films. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget drama just for my own record, with an arrogant attitude towards worldly trends and neglect of his old fans.
