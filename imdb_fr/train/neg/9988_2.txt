Cameron Diaz is a woman married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is beautiful until an ex shows and things get a little complicated. While I was watching this movie, I wondered many times why I was doing it..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and badly written, without any credibility. Neither the public really understands what is happening. Even the beautiful Cameron can not save her on a scale of one to ten.2
