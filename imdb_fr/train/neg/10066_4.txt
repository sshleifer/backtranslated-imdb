I recently reviewed this film and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I feel like it is the same movie but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no pikachu is all that I can come with. If not, why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy was rather boring. She seemed to be almost asleep, no expression at all with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> It was nice enough, but nothing to do. <br /> <br /> A collector (after Lugia, he does not intend to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes many destructions. <br /> <br /> The following pokemon movies are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, without. 8 almost here.
