All Biker Movie genre must be composed of the worst films ever made. It fights a lot, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians and a shantytown that explodes and dismantles one cabin at a time. The game is beyond terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point, he was in big studio productions, then fainted. This movie really is blowing, but if you have not seen a Biker movie for a long time, it's a good movie to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little trashy to have watched!
