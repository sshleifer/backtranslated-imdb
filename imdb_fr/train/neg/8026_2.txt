One wonders how this program is always broadcast. One couple stayed together, married and had children, but all the others separated. What is the point of continuing this? The show can be fun at first. You see all the girls faint in front of one man, almost instantly. It's like in real life! Girls start to take sides, to get dirty and to be true (that's what we think). But there remains a man to decide who to choose who thinks to be able to marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is true love exactly? How can you fall in love with someone when you have to choose? This show is amazing. You thought going out online was bad, but people had to go on TV to find love? It's not realistic How can a girl be with a man when he goes out with several others, talking with them? None of these questions has an answer, and finally, at the end of the show, you know there will be no happy ending in the future. For all we know, everything is written in a script.
