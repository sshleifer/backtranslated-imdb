If I had known that this film had been shot in the maddening and soothing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took a dramamine for seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, a pretentious hubbub. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was "Romance" and it was very dreary, but at least the camera was stable and did not blow in the neck of the characters time. I am puzzled by the growing popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - it will make its way to the United States at about the same time as the next major leprosy outbreak. (It's called Dogme 95 because it's the average number of times the actors are stung by the camera.) <br /> <br />
