It's not so much a film as a big-budget children's television. As far as I know, the villain is a gigantic swarm of espresso beans coated with chocolate. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that subtitles refer to it as "Insomnia". When it was first mentioned that insomnia had wiped out a civilization, I thought, "Wow, a nihilist martial arts movie!" but no luck. Although you have to consider experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrows of an old man. Zu Warriors has exactly the same meaning whether the subtitles are activated or not. It is not a good sign. The special effects are somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
