It's the biggest shit of all time. They seem to have spent more time, effort and money on making the jacket of the DVD than for the film itself. I really thought that the DVD had been turned off with someone's homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors in the cover. This film looks like a person with a hundred dollars and a camcorder and they spent half of it on rats. The photo is really clear, but that, with very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that's actually what they do, and the scenario, if they had one, gives this movie its look worse than old porn. At least old porn makes sense. It sounds like a few PETA members who have come together and decided to make a disturbing and useless public service announcement about the rights and feelings of animals. So it's not worth the money or the time. This has nothing in common with BTK's true serial killer, aside from his name and some of the victims. The people who made this film should be happy that he is not yet free, otherwise he might have chased them just for screwing up the film.
