- = contains a spoiler of the original and cinematographic versions = - <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the musical Notre-Dame De Paris, I also read a book this summer and I watched a movie today, at first I was hoping to watch a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb points. The first scenes were good, but I waited, theatrical scenes directly from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire, I felt that something was wrong, not even kissing in a book, even in musical .. <br /> <br /> and there was a huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by wizard, in the book she teaches her goat how to answer the clock figures or write the word " phoebus ".. wait there was a phoebus were not there? in this film, it is nothing more than soldiers, the creators made discover the love of Quasimodo and they even canceled the love of Frollo..but our lady was frollo. his thoughts his struggles between the love of God and the love of man in the film, we can not find anything of such. We just have a villain who really kills and kills people who are clashing with his thoughts..and not mentioning phoebus, not mentioning frollo's love, not to mention jehan (brother of frollo) without mentioning Esmeralda's mother (maybe the plot would have been well chopped), they did not even mention the real story .. (another PS: frollo was not an opus dei or another member of worship, he is really interested by alchemy, he tries to earn gold ... he was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally, do not watch this film, it's a kind of edition of director to a true masterpiece, and if you have seen it before reading the book, God begs you to read this book immediately .. <br /> <br /> this film is worse than the hunchback of Our -Dame II the animated film, spend your time watching Notre Dame De Paris musical .. enough said ..
