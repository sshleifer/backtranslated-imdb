Words can not describe how catastrophic this film is. This is a series of random and not funny clips about everything from a stupid parody of Batman to a guy who gets along with a dead old lady (REALLY annoying). The only fun thing about the movie Underground Comedy is to watch Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. In addition, it is classified NC-17, thus avoiding the only people who could tolerate it.
