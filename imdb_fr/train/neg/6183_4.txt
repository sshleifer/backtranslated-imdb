In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as President of the United States. North Korea has announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died as a result of a long illness. and a movie called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as serious as the other events of that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps even the worst of this year. Now, in 2009, the United States have another president, another pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it's the same as saying: " getting a hold of it is better than cutting one's head off. "This sequel is a very bad movie that kept me extremely bored and indifferent. The cast of Into the Blue 2: the reef is made up of actors from television series Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances. I liked some previous films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil l and Ted's Excellent Adventure especially), but on this film he can not generate even the minimum of tension, emotion or entertainment. Not only are they being misinterpreted, but they are also disgusting. Honestly, I wanted them all The cinematography of this film is also lame and seems to have been done by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie, better than the original movie, but it's the same as nothing, as I said before. Avoid this shabby movie at all costs.
