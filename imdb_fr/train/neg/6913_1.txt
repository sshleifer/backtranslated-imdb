Believe it or not, "The Woodchipper Massacre" gave me a full gonorrhea! That's right, I have a discharge rainbow springing from me just because a bunch of kids went to play with a camcorder and somehow got a pact with the devil and has been distributed. I do not understand how a person of moderate intelligence could tolerate this charge of film. The only reason I managed to sit (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because, first of all, I was getting bored and, secondly, I guess I wanted to deepen this type of hate recently discovered. I was living ... This film is a "horror comedy" about three siblings left for the weekend in the care of their elderly, bitchy aunt. The youngest child ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with her Rambo replica hunting knife. They then managed to dismember her aunt with various tools (apparently, she did not have a drop of blood in her body!) And to lift her in the rented wood shredder of their father ... Her doomed son stops so looking for his mother and the kids eventually crush that moron too ... I do not remember ever having seen a cast of annoying actors that really made me feel nauseated. Seriously, the voice of this blonde chick made me constantly grimace of pain. ALL the actors were outrageous - literally just shouting out their fake dialogue and jokes that had to be written by a chimpanzee who did not care! Now, I can generally appreciate the independent efforts, but only of those who can realize that people other than their loved ones might be watching this! I do not need to see a 3-minute photo of a car coming out of a driveway, nor a torturous and painfully long montage of lawn with ridiculous and blurry music playing it. Plus, why on earth does the box of this movie have a damn piano ?! There was a piano in a scene and no one was killed near her! I'm done with the memories of this movie. Unless you love an unbearable shit, I would advise anyone with half the brain to avoid this junk.
