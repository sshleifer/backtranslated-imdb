To be honest, I am surprised by the positive votes this film has received. The film spans 81 minutes and the public must suffer all along. In fact, there are positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given a rather pathetic dialogue and she manages it quite well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), meanwhile, is a rather rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is to witness the guy lying on the beach wearing soft tiger-patterned ... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us a rude and pathetic portrait of the suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a much more convincing interpretation of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and punctuated only positively by Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. Honestly, this film can only be recommended to fans of Charlie Spradling (who I am, and I still had a hard time watching it!).
