Because it's the only way to not think that this movie is a total waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait", (which deserved to be watched at least) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more a way to give Rock some time on the movie for a weak comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes are generally supposed to come from the body of a fat, rich and dead old man, but are shown from Rock himself. When he insults blacks and whites, chemistry is completely wrong. The film is not funny, badly shot the acting is weak at best. Go rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live video of Rock and you'll be one step ahead of the game.
