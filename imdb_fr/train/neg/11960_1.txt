In fact, I withdrew from Asian horror movies some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing the same ghost story. However, I am more and more interested in exploitation films recently so I decided to give them another chance. My first contact was the much appreciated "Visitor Q" of director Takashi Miike. I had already seen Audition and, although I did not like it very much, I consider it one of the best modern horror movies in Asia. So, I went into that with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately, found that boredom. I guess this film is actually very clever and it went over my head, but it seemed to me that it was simply a set of violent and unpleasant scenes, with little or no coherence between them . Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous to me; all that Miike has done here is to make a movie; all the information that surrounds it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperately seeking meaning. My headache appeared after about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it did not dissipate until the end of the movie; at least twenty-four hours later, it seems. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and, in fact, I'm actively looking for the most notorious movies of the moment; but although it may be violent, it is also useless and boring and I have not benefited from it. Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans, but I certainly do not; and I hope that this is the last time that I will come into contact with one of his films.
