The premise of this movie was pretty decent, but with a mediocre action game, it was just bland and boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS it was a murder, it was not like the guy had decided it. In addition, some flashbacks reveal a secret that somehow makes events such as justice. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so are simply this woman who calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With a little polishing and a better acting, it could have been very good.
