"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a breathtaking melodrama that looks more like a camp, a satire drag queen than anything that is about real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film insists that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines, they embody traditional Japanese beauty. But apart from a breathtaking dance, the rest of the film degenerates into "Pretty Baby" in Storyville's territory, or at least Vashti and Esther in the story of Purim, because all women's efforts in art and artifice are meant to entertain many, much older, drunken rude men. Maybe it's the Japanese culture that is being prostituted, not just for the American hooligans after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the stress of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang barely shows much of the big flare she showed in "House of Flying Daggers" (Shi mian mai fu) "and" Hero (Ying xiong) ". Michelle Yeoh sometimes has the opportunity to project a glow of her assured performance into "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)". Only Li Gong shows real life. Otherwise, I continued to imagine Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in Kabuki theater, especially when the plot was dragging in one battle after another. <br /> <br /> The supposed love story has no chemistry, mainly because of age differences, and I felt especially sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped that his Hollywood paycheck compensate for his loss of dignity as a mysterious "president". I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jennie" as the girl was eager to become Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see a brief glimpse of reality when geishas pose with ordinary women as photographers. attractions, and as an ageless, Ziyi Zhang saw the war years in a dying operation of very colorful kimono. The finale has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The score includes many chopped traditional melodies, with cello Yo Yo Ma and violin Yitzhack Pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation, which are beautiful to listen to accompanying the beautiful cinematography, as long as the intrigue and the rigorous play are completely ignored. <br /> <br /> As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese filmmakers of samurai would have treated this story, which would probably have been more formal, but much more emotional.
