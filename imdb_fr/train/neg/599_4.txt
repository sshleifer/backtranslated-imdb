Okay, I must say that before the revelation of the "monster". saying that he really was not in this category, just a strange thing that had a shrill cry! And personally, I think a grandma could have run away from this thing, but anyway. In fact, I was beginning to get into this movie, although the fact that the main character is a drunkard and a heroin addict is not a call. But scenes like the one where she escaped the train and you could see that the silhouette at the door was rather frightening, where the guard had just been killed and the "monster" putting his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster remained when the monster was revealed, it just became your average horror, with limited emotions or sensations. Slowly, I got bored more and more and wanted to close everything. As most people told me, it was to encourage the homeless to succeed, especially the guy, he gave me some cheap laughter here and there. I think this film could have been really something special instead of becoming what all the other horrors are nowadays! Just boring and well worth it. <br /> <br /> if you are looking for a cheap fear here or there, or an unscrupulous festival (which is limited, which is practically nonexistent), give it a go for it, but for all the observers of serious horror, look elsewhere, much better movies.
