This movie is just horrible. John Ritter falling, 75% of actors deliver their lines as if they read them from memory cards, a poor editing, a horrible sound mix is ​​not going anywhere. I never thought I'd said that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who are more afraid. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she was dead inside. Even the children of Bogdanovich are awful (the oldest is reading her lines from a memory card). This movie is seriously horrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich was not able to get another project until 4 years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you'd better find another soulmate. I'd rather tear my eyes off with a pair of clippers instead of sitting in that garbage bin again. If I could summarize this film in one word, this word would be: Suckotrocity
