Rosario Dawson plays the role of a girl who is raped by one day and then begins in the dark until she has a chance to take revenge. Although the reasons Dawson took the role are clear, it's a chance to show his acting skills and make a small independent film, decidedly non-Hollywood, but it is also clear that, apart from a superb beauty, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me, I just could not find it. It's not a mistake, it's what I felt, I did not know where she was. Yes, I know she's on screen, but even though I spent almost two hours looking at her, she left me with no impression. I blame the script for this because, aside from the end, not many things that happened on the screen seemed to make sense. People seemed to be more in posture than real and what was happening did not seem to go together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this film, aside from the end (which I would like to talk about but can not spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson is nothing but an image, remained with me. What can I say, it can click with you, it may not be the case, for me, it is time that I can not return. For fans of Rosario Dawson only, know that there are several reasons why it is NC17. (And Rosario, please, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
