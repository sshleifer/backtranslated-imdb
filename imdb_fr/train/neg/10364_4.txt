The book is so good that at least the opening of this film made for television will move you, but then, as it moves away from the book, it removes all religion, love and mathematics and puts up snapshots of cotton candy. it becomes boring. Yet, from the comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to appreciate it, and if it even makes the child read A Ride in Time, it will have achieved its goal . The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh). Nothing is as uncomfortable as characters on the screen who laugh hilarious things totally insane.
