Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some movies are good and some are bad. Of course, there are extremes in these two broad categories. Movies such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars fit comfortably into the category of good movies. At the other end of the spectrum, there are movies that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. However, it happens that someone produces a truly lamentable film. A film that should be distinguished as a demonstration of the gravity of a film. A film that is more than bad. Maiden Travel is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Briefly, Maiden Voyage is the story of a luxury cruise ship, hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from the owner of a ship as evil as an accomplice. Of course, there is an American hero aboard, with a chiseled jaw and a carved trunk, that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that plunges into new depths. Everything is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breathtaking. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unhappy spectator. Even an American viewer would be bored by his faults. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that irritated me against this film. . However, his more stupid than stupid conclusion should serve as an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are a perverse hijacker and that you are in a lifeboat open on a calm sea. . You are in the company of the hero who has a time bomb. The hero throws you the bomb and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as possible into the sea. Not this guy. He watches our hero go away, then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough said. Such a demise deserves a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could also be an appropriate conclusion for the life of the production team.
