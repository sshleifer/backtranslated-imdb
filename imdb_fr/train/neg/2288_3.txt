Who is Bettie Page? I certainly have not discovered by watching this movie. From what I learned from other sources, Ms. Page was in great demand in the post-war period, as a queen of "naughty" images, and that's exactly what this film describes. However, I never knew Bettie, the woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was both an evangelical Christian education and a sordid life at home. The film goes through his personal life and goes straight to the goal of the film, the "naughty" images. The characters are introduced and abandoned in a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in his pointy bras, Bettie in his belt and his stockings, Bettie in his slavery ... etc. The film glides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page goes to Miami Beach. Let's go back to his shades of greyish life in New York. Gretchen Mol describes Bettie as one of the darkest ladies you can meet. When Bettie tells a friend that she was not a high school high school student by getting an A instead of an A, we can only assume that there were only two students in her third class cycle. The most interesting part of this film is how strange Ms. Page's "naughty" photos look in 2007. It's really sad to see a woman tied up like a pig on a spit would not even be touched by My Space or You Tube. . I'm not sure if this movie was badly written or if a crazy publisher tore it to pieces. I would only recommend it as a source of information for people who are studying the history of strange underwear.
