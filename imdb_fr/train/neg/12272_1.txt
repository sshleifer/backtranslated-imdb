In simple terms, this is the worst film since "Police Academy: Moscow Mission" (if you liked this movie, this one will probably please you). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? Some ideas should stay like that, an idea. The fact that this idea can itself be filmed should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so serious about it, I hear you ask. A word ... ALL. <br /> <br /> Rental cost: $ 4.50 Cost to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund for both!
