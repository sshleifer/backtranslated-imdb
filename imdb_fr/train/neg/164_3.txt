I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I could not wait to see that. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its narrow underwater style and cutting edge technology, compared to the Treks we are used to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything interesting about it. this driver. I found the plot complicated and confusing. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that I liked the development of the character - the representation of humans as a "teenager" that would become too big for their britches was fun. <br /> <br /> And this Vulcan girl had a hell of an incredible rack. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I will become addicted to this series. <br /> 3/10
