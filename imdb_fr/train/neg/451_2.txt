I do not care how many nominations this junk food got for the best of this and that, this stinky movie. I did not know whether to turn off the device or take legal action with O.J.'s attorney for unjustified harm to my mental health. I have rarely been so bored; to call it a distraction is a slap for all moviegoers on the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was not inspired, the "drama" was emotionless. I am grateful that I do not have to pay for this unrewarding experience.
