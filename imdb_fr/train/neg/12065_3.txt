When I was a child and I lived with my sister, she bought all the horror movies she could find and that was one of them. The VCRs had just become a household item and we did not have any, but about 150 movies and we watched them all. <br /> <br /> I was at a garage sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie that I do not have and I knew that this film seemed familiar to me. I thought for a second and realized that it was one that my sister had bought. I suppose he sold it years ago. Who knows? <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything and I watched it the night I bought it. It refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it when I was a kid, but I'm sure I liked it because it was new to me and I would look and enjoy anything at it time. <br /> <br /> I am a horror phenomenon, but there are certain conditions for me to consider it "good" and this one is very short. It was one of those speeches that was causing me trouble. The scenes of death that you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by splash of blood and it is if you are lucky that you have so many. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I saw some with similar intrigues. so I think this one should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless you are difficult.
