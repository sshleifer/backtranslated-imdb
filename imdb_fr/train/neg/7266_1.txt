... and yet, we were told, there was still an hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why is there no publisher to tell the screenwriter / director to shoot, snip? Apparently, this author / director has already made short films; in short, it would have been correct. But the lack of dialogue begins to be felt after twenty minutes. The lack of a lot of music bursts. The background noise (conversation, traffic and especially a helicopter ubiquitous) age very quickly. But the worst failure is in the story. Beyond a short film, it is precious. <br /> <br /> After an hour, we have seen over and over the variations of the same scene. I almost shouted on the screen: "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It is amazing that after leaving the theater, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bedtime and know that the audience was ALWAYS stuck in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to let go of your vision. You must give the audience enough to share your vision.
