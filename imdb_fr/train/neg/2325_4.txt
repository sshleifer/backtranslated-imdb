the first scanners may not have been a good movie, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty in this one. The acting is worse, in my opinion, and the 'story is slower and nothing special.I like dialogue.and the special effects are not better than in the original.This is a movie is inferior to the first in every respect.The only thing that changes is that it is sometimes strong and chaotic. But it does not work. Do not make a good movie. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, it could have been a decent movie. In fact, I could not go through all this without a fast forward. For me, it's an unforgettable memory. movie, and not much more. Nevertheless, there are worse films. In a good mood, I will give 4.95 to Scanners 2.
