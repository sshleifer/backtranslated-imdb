What made me hunt down this film is watching Vampyres. I thought I needed to get the other movies this guy (Larroz) had made. I was sorry to have followed this track. It is a weak attempt to produce a film of occult / satanic type. with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for sleaze.) The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere, avoid this one, too much hype surrounds it, not worth not the effort to find it, this is a reference I hope he has other films up to Vampyres, Oh and that the scene of the goats was very boring, I understand that's what brings the hype media.
