I really enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a sequel. Everything related to it - budget, script, plot, casting and interpretation - was less than the original. Gale Sondergaard in the role of Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, no more than half of the other "Indians", played by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with good wigs market. And the old man playing the leader behaved more like a fat old squaw than a fierce warrior. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to have made good progress this time around. I guess he could not resist the easy salary he got for resuming his role as a horse. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are interesting moments in the film, such as Horse undergoes a painful purification ritual "find his vision" and rally the Yellow Hands to their Indian enemies and their white oppressors , but overall, Return is erratic, boring, tacky and predictable - as in most suites.
