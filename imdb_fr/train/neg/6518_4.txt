The film is pretty funny and involves about four dates, then it becomes a blatant advertisement for a guy that you (and even his "friends") really can not stand. It's a pretty interesting concept. The film dates on a quest to find true love in modern Los Angeles. The problem is that he feels incredibly (and badly) written from time to time and self-proclaimed. It is difficult to get interested and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer / actor is so selfish, not cool, fake and simply inconceivable. You end up feeling sorry for his dates.
