My husband and I are the parents of a little autistic boy who lives in the same town as the screenwriter of this movie. We were very upset that the CGC is bringing this film to its Jewish film festival because of the way in which the character of Frankie, mentally disabled, is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We asked for a refund. We encourage the scriptwriter to give some of the funds to the JCC's Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We did not like to see Frankie - a mentally disabled and maybe even autistic teenager - as part of a joke that he keeps throwing at something to look at the breasts of the nurse. <br /> <br /> Frankie's character was useless except to say, "Hey, being mentally handicapped is funny." Challenges like Frankie's are a serious business. Families like mine really suffer. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter must explain. Does she know of families with disabled children? Does she see families with disabled children week after week at the JCC pool?
