You know that you have problems when the opening narrative basically tells you who survives. Everything happens from there. Useless, "Matrix" -influenced bullet camera work. Unnecessary cuts in video game sequences. Old sea captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who become skilled fighters in the blink of an eye. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping at least one film "so bad it's good", but this one is "so bad that the people involved in its creation should be banned from making a film again". <br /> <br />
