*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today, I expected it to be like, not too high, but not too low either. It was not what I expected at all, however, it seems to me that filmmakers can not decide what kind of film to do. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it's a bit mysterious. and a little exciting, but it will soon change into ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... Looking further, I almost fell asleep several times. <br /> <br /> The end is the most ridiculous of all. although, almost splash / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying he does not have good scenes, it's just that the movie never becomes "whole". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
