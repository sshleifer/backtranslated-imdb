This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives are beautiful models and have no problem getting them. It sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, does not it? This whole movie was written by Peter and he shows how disconnected he was from real people. You're supposed to write what you know and that's what he did. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, by the way. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered just after the shoot. But Patti Hanson, who would marry in real life Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but she is much better and has a larger role. In fact, Stratten's role seemed forced; added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated at first. Overall, every character in this movie is a person with whom very few people can relate, unless you are a manhattan millionaire with great models at your fingertips. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snoring festival. This is what happens when you are out of touch. You entertain your friends with jokes and you support everything else.
