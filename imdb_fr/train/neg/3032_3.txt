Someone told me it was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since discredited everything that this individual told me after watching this film. It's just terrible. Without going into long descriptions of the different scenes, take me at the word, the sex scenes are at best uninteresting. Jenna in normal early attire was the highlight of the movie (looks good) but everything is downhill from there.
