When evaluating documentaries centered on a relatively small group of ultra-conservative and ugly ugly groups in the United States, you need to consider the following. The United States of America, with its population of 270 million and its complex history of democracy in the making, its hopes and desire to defend human rights, its weaknesses and disadvantages. It is of course expected that right-wing and ultra-conservative groups exist in considerable numbers, but that, relative to the size of the population, they are very small and isolated. Per capita, Europe, Great Britain and even Australia have similar right-wing groups, but the number of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than that of the United States of America. It is for these reasons that it is unjustifiable to belittle and defame the American people and their level of debate in the Educated American Society by presenting in a very fraudulent and misleading way this group of far-right psychopaths as representatives of the American Society. . In doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to create an image of America that is a scandalous and deliberately sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to ignite and calm the opinions of those who feed this subconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and their way of life under the guise of leftist ideology left spurist fashion and clich√©. This film was made for profit, not to advance the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that deal with ultra-right-wing, military-industrial complex plots, but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate, not to mention alternative solutions to the weaknesses of a vibrant democracy. Movie Show is exposed as anti-American by his support to this trash. SENSATIONALISM at its worst anti-USA trash shameful.
