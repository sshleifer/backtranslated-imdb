A Christmas story is a classic holiday and my favorite movie. So naturally, I was moved when this movie was released in 1994. I saw it open and I was ready to enjoy it. I left revolted and digested. The anticipation that has proved true in a Christmas story is curiously lacking in this mess. A red Ryder BB gun is better than a Chinese top. And it's not very funny at all. Charles Grodin is good but the buck stops there. At the end of the line: 1 star. Do not even bother.
