I will not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I was expecting something good, but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than that. It was completely old fashioned. At each stage of this film, I was hoping for a bit of resonance and what can I have? The girl burns herself and earns her aunt's love. <br /> <br /> Despite their commitment, they must ask permission for every small gesture they make. They are extremely shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was a cradle like crazy. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have kids too, but we do not look at them and always have tears in their eyes. This film is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves him to death. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the father of the poor wife and now, it's the opposite. And I knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I lost my time. I give him a 2/10.
