Oh my God. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke. besides the point that it seems to have been written by a child of 5 years. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this film were beyond shame. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually so critical of a movie because everyone has their own style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst film I saw in 2008. I honestly believe this movie is unknown, and I think it should stay that way, because such films make this kind of thriller a joke. <Br/> <br /> I advise anyone who likes thriller movies, or even movies, to get away from it.
