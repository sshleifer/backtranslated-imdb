This show is just boring !!! I'm sorry for the actors having to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laughter track tries to hide the sad jokes and the track "Awwww" appears at the most useless moments. Dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is cliche of the city. If you were looking for the cliche word, it would read "Full House" Every story has a "life lesson" to learn at the end. A pompous speech improves everything and even has the capacity to make the most tired child suddenly aware of kindness. Too bad that it is not possible in real life. I do not know how anyone could watch this show without talking about the character's behavior or the laughter track. I find myself screaming on TV saying, "It's not funny / sad / cute" If life was really like that, the world would collapse.
