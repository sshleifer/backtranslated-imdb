When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said she loved him. <br /> <br /> We have been misled. <br /> <br /> For my part, I felt Billy Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Of course, he made two good jokes, but as a character, he was just taking up space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows, she plays well as a determined and determined woman. In this film, she seems completely repressed and has very little fire. It's not Julia Roberts that my wife likes to watch. <br /> <br /> OK, if I found a good thing, it would be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, we see almost nothing of his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of brainless laughter with very little redeeming value, go see it. But if you're looking for an elegant romantic comedy, it's not your movie. This is nothing of the above.
