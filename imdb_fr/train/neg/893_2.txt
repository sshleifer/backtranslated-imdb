When I bought this DVD, I thought, "It seems like a beautiful light comedy about love and relationships invented by Portuguese standards. I was totally wrong! What a disappointing film! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the plot is so boring and leads nowhere? It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one direction or the other ?? The production is also bad! The mix of sounds is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected. This reminded me of some old Portuguese movies of the 80's ?? The game should have been better too ?? To summarize, it is not with films like this that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad acting, poor production ?? I did not have much hope for this film, but it was much worse than I would have ever imagined! Forget that!
