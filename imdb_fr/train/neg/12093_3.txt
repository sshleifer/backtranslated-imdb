Isabelle Huppert is a great actor. The director of "The Pianist" understands this, offering the viewer long shots of Huppert's face, which is nice to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she records emotions with a smile or a dull smile. <br /> <br /> Apart from the pleasure of seeing an experienced actor excel in his job, there is nothing this film that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sadomasochism, and weird behavior, "The Pianist" may be right for you, except for these attributes, I will not find any redeeming value.) <br /> <br /> Buried in all this strange material, there is a core of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, whatever - start out as strangers, and are transformed into strangers by the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> Do not bother going to the movies relearning this lesson of life. <br /> <br />
