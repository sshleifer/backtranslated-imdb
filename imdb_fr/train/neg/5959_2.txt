A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What are the three words that can guarantee you a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. THE BRAIN is perfectly suited to these words. A frightening scenario, an idiotic acting game and hilarious special effects make it a must-see for all movie fans. The horror is hilarious. The post-production team seems to have given up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable, it is in the second period, it is actually being good! A little ingenuity and consistency can they save what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's around Christmas. A mother and her daughter are murdered by one of the funniest villains in the world. The next day, a rebellious teenager has enough problems to undergo a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If the head of a policeman is cut off and a stranger with blood and a bloody ax tells you some children did it, who would you believe? What starts out as funny becomes dull and tiring towards the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be scared by scary moments. THE BRAIN is a fun concept to be serious. The Psychological Research Institute is bigger than the big manufacturing plants! Our nasty villain and his cohorts have the merit of having pulled some of the worst actors I have ever seen. The discretion of the spectator is strongly advised.
