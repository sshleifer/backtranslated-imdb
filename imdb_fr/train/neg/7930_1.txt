This piece of shit may have been popular 60 years ago, but it's one of the most racist films ever made with Native Americans, played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, as was his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart sent Hal Williams back to "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (an ephemeral series that luckily failed) simply because Williams was black. As if that was not enough, this movie is very dated and boring. Observe instead "Dance with the wolves" for a less racist vision. <br /> <br /> Stewart was forty when this horrible movie was shot. Debra Paget I'm surprised that this was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
