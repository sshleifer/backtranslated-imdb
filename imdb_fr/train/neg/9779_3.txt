A relentlessly stupid, "budgetless" image of war is primarily intended to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but it should be a nuisance for all those connected to it. "Scripture" laughable, performances that would not fail to play in a primary school Christmas show, unseen scenes "action", confused direction by the documentary maker normally competent Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently does not really know s it is comic, a philosophical treatise on the uselessness of war or a T & A (by the standards of the early 1960s, anyway) and seductive of Eve Meyer's beautiful body - and a general air of mediocre and incompetent. It's worth watching for Eve Meyer strutting, but that's about it.
