Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she is related to Bruce), the killer of the first film, is still at his stuff. She is one of the counselors at Rolling Hills Camp. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing go well. But a few steps above the line and Angela kills them - making nasty jokes. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and unpleasant movie but had some positives. This is vicious and nasty too, but has no good points for that. The plot has been made to death and this adds nothing new to the formula. There are a lot of bloody murders here (people are burned alive, heads are cut, the throat is cut) but all the blood is so obvious that it is wrong to become really comical. It also has the smallest number of campers I have ever seen and almost everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is free nudity (here provided by Valerie Hartman, an extremely talented woman) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins, the acting is shabby - even by slasher standards. There is also a cruel side in this film in which a character is drowned in an addiction! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, useless nudity and bad gore. Jump.
