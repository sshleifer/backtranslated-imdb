Frank Sinatra embodies an unscrupulous ex-soldier and a frustrated, living, and drinking writer who returns to his hometown of the Midwest and finds his brother (Arthur Kennedy), who became the city's big city with a disinterested wife and daughter stubborn. Frank mingles with Dean Martin, Shirley MacLaine, who has no education, and is interested in the law, but what he really wants is to write and settle down with a good woman. Drama too simplistic on the verge of a soap opera, with a role for MacLaine in turn too "colorful" and sentimentally embarrassing (his sound drunk on "After You've Gone" is however the highlight of the film and is managed by expertly). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees the film in a simple way, but it is surprisingly gloomy and most large scenes are flat or dense. The photo is incredibly beautiful in widescreen, with a good sense of detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from ****
