I was looking for a simple and cute comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie proved to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a single positive point about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, based on tired and recycled jokes and a petulant turtle. In my book, it's not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low-budget "effects" (if I can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places, it almost looks like an independent film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Play ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for the money they agreed to take? (Looking at their recent filmography, it seems that yes.) Despite the outfits, Pamela shows her age and overall, they do not even look sexy, much less fun. <br /> <br /> the film is not even in the category of bad guys. It's just bad, as if everyone involved was fed up. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
