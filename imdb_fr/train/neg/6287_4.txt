I read about this film in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman who sees herself one day walking in her own car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> but that's not the case. First, the title. The broken? The broken ... what? What is broken? The ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, it's practically the only thing to do. <br /> <br /> The principle is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did a lot better in "Mirrors". A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors and another rather mediocre. A more appropriate title would be "The Boring", as it draws each scene for bloody ages. Or maybe 'The Confusing', because it explains nothing at all, neither in the story, nor in the story itself, but only a vague idea of ​​perverse prints and such images, dotted with scenes of fear and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the acting and the special effects are pretty good, but it's not a difficult role to play. <br /> <br /> After watching Twice after the movie, I still feel dissatisfied, a little confused perhaps, and not in the genre of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not look at this one. In simple terms, there are better thrillers.
