Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Add some cute animals, terrible word games and a pair of roller skates and you'll end up with an almost exact replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him when I was younger; I rented my mother at the video library about 5 times. The story itself is not too bad, it's just that the Marxists who follow the movie would certainly have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
