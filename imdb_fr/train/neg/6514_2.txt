The film tries to be a fake documentary - shot in documentary form but with many parts obviously scripted - but fails to provide the public with any character with which to create the illusion of the fake documentary. In addition, the film claims to aim to find true love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninspiring look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first "big film".
