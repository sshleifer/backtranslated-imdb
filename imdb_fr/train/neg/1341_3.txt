Following the success of Gilligan's Island's (dreaded) re-releases of television movies, a number of television films were made in the 1980s, bringing together casts of classic programming. Most of these films completely missed the mark as they rediscovered the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointing because it's a Laurel and Hardy-style comedy style that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful actress essential to the series, is completely lost - she has less time here in this 90-minute film than in any 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are just cameos, what was the point of rejuvenating and remaking them? With very little rewrite, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the spooky parents of the Munsters was a good idea, I did not like Sid Caesar as a mad scientist, mainly because there are too many and not enough underused Munsters (ironically that same year, 1981, former Caesar's partner in comedy, Imogene Coca also wrongly played a major role in a TV movie (RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) .Another strange and inexplicable element at the beginning of the film was the Munster family represented in the form of wax figures in a museum of local horror wax.Why would they be there when they are supposed to be a "typical" American family (so strange), not famous monsters? This was the last project from Munsters, who staged the original cast, which was revived in the late 1980s with a brand new cast and TV movie from the 1990s. They included DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick. family's dinner.
