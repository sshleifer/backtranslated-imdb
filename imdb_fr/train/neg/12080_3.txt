I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I looked forward to seeing this episode. I will first comment on the film, then the episode MST3K. The recipe for this film: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement until you become dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large stone cauldron. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors deserve at least a little credit. Ok, now the episode MST3K. I admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was also the reaction of several other witnesses. However, when I looked at it a second time, I realized there was a whole series of smart references and good lines that I missed the first time. The thing with this episode is: listen well! It takes a few views to catch each line. Give him a second chance and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 of 10.
