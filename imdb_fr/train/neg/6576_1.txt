I totally disagree with those comments that say it's a good movie. This is a totally SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner went from an innocent girl to a girl looking for a party, without any convincing reason. In addition, all the actresses seemed way too old to be students - the students seemed to be about 30 years old - you see the rest. I watched only about the first ten minutes and I started moving quickly to look for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hasty and above all not at all frontal. All sex scenes are laughable, given the number of clothes worn. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save a few dollars. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Actor - 0, Score - 0 of 10.
