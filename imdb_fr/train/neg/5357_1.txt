I do not know where to start. This film is very much like one of those cheap Saturday morning children's shows they used to do in the late eighties and early nineties. A bit like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and "secret agencies" and bad guys with a really old-fashioned sound. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The management is terrible and there is little continuity so far. It seems that someone threw a lot of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes of the film occurs early, when several villains plant explosive device in a car of agents. For some reason, even though the device is clearly marked as "detonating remotely", the bad guys decide to chase it on their motorcycles as it moves away. This pursuit continues. Meanwhile, the bad guys make ridiculous and completely useless bike stunts. Standing on the bikes, doing cabarets, etc. At one point, an accident occurs and one of the attackers is thrown off his bike. We see the bike (clearly CGI) knocked down on the agent's car, but the runner has disappeared. Seconds later, the cyclist and the bike come back ... seemingly unscathed from the collision. At this point, even if an explosive device is installed in the car, the attackers decide to shoot the officer as he passes, then to blow up his car. Which was also clearly done with CGI. Sounds confusing to you? This is the case of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I would point out that when I say cgi, we are not talking about the type Lord Of The Rings cgi here. We are talking about cheap Power Rangers type cgi, in fact I think it was better with Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why did Savini and Todd do this movie that I'll never know, I can only assume that they're doing for money, to help someone or because we were singing there ... probably the last one.
