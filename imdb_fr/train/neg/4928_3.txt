This romantic adventure must have seemed terribly subversive in his day. A wealthy English woman of the upper class strategizes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to engage in secret activities with a resolutely antisocial character. There is a clever reversal of sex roles as her activities prove her more daring and daring than most male characters. But of course, there is a tall, beautiful and dark unknown to maintain the interest of love, and this wicked lady is not back when she meets the good man. all the other characters make the plot unconvincing to the extreme, but those who crave romance will forget it.
