The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Viewed from this angle, he delivers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers only a superficial and superficial examination of "problems" without any insight. <br /> <br /> Creating a film about stereotypes, then transforming each character into a stereotype stereotype is an extremely mediocre strategy - especially when these same characters break their ridiculous molds only predictably and stereotypically. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost visible, and Michael Rappaport makes a good performance, but the screenplay is so horrible and the social comment is so commonplace that it's hard to find something that redeems.
