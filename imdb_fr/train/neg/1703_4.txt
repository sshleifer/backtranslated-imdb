A Vietnam veterinarian decides to take control of a lost city and anyone who gets on his way is eliminated (including women). Released in theaters just before "A Star Is Born", which has transformed his career, this dramatic action film starring Kris Kristofferson is completely offbeat, thoughtless and petty. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, the results are truly inappropriate: rednecks shots and senseless violence are the essence of director George Armitage's screenplay. Armitage brought together a most curious cast of the 70s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Bernadette Peters, Victoria's director and, in a moment, Loni Anderson; However, the center of everything is Kristofferson, who is gruff and rude. I think that deserves arguments for being a totally unfriendly thriller, but the bad vibrations (and the ridiculous climax) cover the whole project like a lousy spot. * 1/2 of ****
