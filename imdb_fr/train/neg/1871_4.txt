Despite the sumptuous production figures and gorgeous costumes, this film is a chore to watch. The mystery assassination plot is simply a way to set up the musical numbers, but it often stops the proceedings in an amazing way and is not very engaging. Although obviously a lot of money has been spent, the numbers are poorly organized and poorly photographed. This is obviously a pre-code movie because girls often wear very little clothes and there is even a song singing the praises of marijuana! The performances are all on a note although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as a lieutenant of the police, goes for the umpteenth time looking for clues, you'll want maybe throw in the towel or less fast to the next issue. Pity the customers who were trapped in the cinema when it was released!
