I love Columbo and have seen just about every episode, but this one is definitely one of the worst of its kind. A staggering, tedious, useless and confusing bunch of unstoppable words that are losing both the audience time and the acting skills of an extremely bored Peter Falk. The plot, as it appears, seems to be invented as the film advances, without any hint of the ingredients of the formula that has made the series a success so bright. Part of the procedure that I found extremely confusing (or possibly annoying) was to introduce Peter Falk's character to the wedding guests as "Lt" Columbo. If the producers insist that the name of Columbo be kept secret, why could not they have omitted this line because it seems ridiculous? As I said, it's the pits and all the real fans of Columbo would do well to avoid it like the plague.
