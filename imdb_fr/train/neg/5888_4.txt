I saw it recently on an old VHS tape, and I remember it vaguely. Looking at it now, it looks charming. <br /> <br /> When it was released, it was recognized by just about everyone as a parody for gay teenager outing. To pound the point of the house, we see the mother reading a pocket copy of "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular output book of the time. David Warner describes him as the persecuting vampire hunter [= evangelist who hates homosexuals], which is of course a disgusting closet locker. The list of gags in sight and included jokes that were included to make sure no one misses a point would be too long. Producers enjoyed themselves and hoped, without a doubt, to enlighten and enlighten. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how an adolescent audience will watch this movie nowadays. In some places where there is education and culture, the terrifying experiences faced by gay teens are now a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark and evil corners of our continent where the situation is still bad.
