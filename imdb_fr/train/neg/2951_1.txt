Do not see this movie if you keep in mind. At the end of our collective viewing, my friends and I felt that we had each lost 5% of our brain during his course. The decorator was the only person involved in her making who was not clinically crazy. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in the mouth. I realize now that this film, instead of a feeling of disgust, fed me with a deep hatred. I hate this movie so much. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only he did not take himself seriously. But that's the case. The plot is a heated version of the universe of Blade Runner-esque, merged with the cheap rubber suits that prevail in bad dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not only childish and meaningless, it is often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern, as Theodore Rex's voice, is like a fingernail on the soul. And whether it's Juliet Landua and his British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the executioner commissioner, you'll sink into a growing sense of incredulity and disillusionment. only to anyone who wants to see the depths of the stupidity to which humanity can fall.
