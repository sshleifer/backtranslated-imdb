I can not believe I wasted my money renting this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never got better. The actors play, the music drowning the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through as they knew the music would cover the lines of conversation. I have never heard of the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being slaughtered. What does this have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors / actresses in this film. The script would have sent me back to the first page of reading. You'd better watch the paint dry.
