ok, this movie f * ck in 'rules. it is without a doubt one of the most technically incompetent cinema pieces. absolutely terrible, but you have to see it. praise it with your friends and make a drinking game or have fun, it's hilarious. and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do it all with paper plates and finger painting. impressive. Okay, just rent it for this scene: two characters are walking around for about 3 minutes. the director (in the commentary) says "yeah, the tracking was so smooth it looks like they are ...". yes, it's true, they walk totally on the spot. it's so funny.
