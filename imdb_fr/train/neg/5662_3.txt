When I read most of the other reviews, I felt they were too bright for this movie. I found that he had completely lost the spark found in Zatoichi's early films and that this proves that after a long absence of the screen, it is often better to let things happen. I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy of another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series - millions of enthusiastic fans were waiting and waiting for the series to return and were forced to watch a movie. bland and sterile film. approximation of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly bloody (although the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier) and lacks the heart of the originals. The blood did not bother me at all, but some may be destabilized (especially the scenes with the nose and heads cut). Plus, the weather was not nice for Ichi - he seems to be a broken and sad man in this movie (a lot, a lot more than usual) - and that's something fans of the show could not not really want to see. <br /> <br /> It was a very bad return for Zatoichi. Unless you're like me and you want to see EVERY Zatoichi film, this one is very jumped. Refer to one of the previous versions or the all-new 2003 version.
