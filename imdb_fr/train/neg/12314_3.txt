Maybe I'm really getting older, but this one and the old Funny Bone miss me completely. There must be something powerful about this Irishman (it's me, Schultz!). Lordy, Lord, what would I give to see the light? First, Phil Silvers' manic energy, wit, and motivation were really part of comic education and general education in life, if you will. Although it is possible that the series, originally titled "You Will Never Get Rich" (1955-1959 *), was broadcast on the CBS television network with another person in the Sgt's lead role. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine another actor / comedian in the case bearing the stripes of this master sergeant. <br /> <br /> Such strong identification is inevitable, although it is not the same kind of career nightmare that has proven to be the case of George Reeves' Clayton More ("The Lone Ranger"). ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> Our collective memory is one of the main obstacles to the successful adaptation and updating of such work, from the television screens of the 1950s to the 1990s in the movies. Without knowing exactly what percentage of the crowd remembered the character of Bilko for seeing the initial recovery and the first awakening of syndication, and their number was certainly considerable; even a large part of the youth had seen Bilko reissue recently. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years away. <br /> <br /> In order not to be perceived as a completely square, old grunt, consider other points. <br /> <br /> Here today, the 14th day In November 2007, let me swear and affirm under oath that I have been a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years. In addition, I enjoyed the spirit and talent of Dan Akroyd, co-stars of Bilko '96 the death of Phil Hartman. After all, it's the talent of guys like this and so many others, the alumni of "NBC, Saturday NIGHT" and "SECOND CITY TV" that made the last quarter of the twentieth century laugh. But a BILKO re-do; it was not just clicking. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie would have been shot as a service comedy (still loved!), but without the names of the Bilko Show and would have given it some identity, it would be the older ones, like me, hold in high esteem. <br /> <br /> We have already had so many series of sitcoms and cartoons turned into movies, what's next? How about someone doing Hal Roach's comedy serie DOUALDAY & AMES from World War II, and the first TV series "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you heard it first! POODLE SCHNITZ!
