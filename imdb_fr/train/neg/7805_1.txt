One can usually afford to miss the first film of an actor - this is often the first work where the lack of cinematic experience of all actors is really visible, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than anything. that even in 1982, it's so bad that it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area with an obviously reduced budget, most actors play rigorous roles, in wood and caricaturists - a mix between a high school play and a bad community theater. The noise of the nearby traffic often covers the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that seems forced and expeditious rather than natural and organic. The scenes are artificial and jerky, and even if the characters go through years, neither the children nor the adults grow old. <br /> <br /> I think it's possible to make a Christian movie worthy of the name. general public, layman, but all too often, the creators of such films are so focused on "The Message" or, in this case, on their own autobiographical links with the project, that the good film production values ​​are set aside. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and the cast member.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was a lot more interesting - and more credible - look in his later films. Careers like hers are certainly not built on movies like this one.
