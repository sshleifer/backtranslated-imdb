I rated this movie at 1 because the plot is so amazing unbelievable. Judge by yourself. Be warned, the following will not only reveal the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends code through television screens and computer screens. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can access the "electrical system" of your body. This forces the body's cells to excrete calcium. A few seconds after the infection, the patient reaches his neck, develops a tunnel vision, his skin whiten limestone, after which he will fall and his hand and his skull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When he discovers that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device (activated by hand), he is set to a very high voltage, which causes severe burns on the skin of the head of the expert. The virus also detects aggression against remotes and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately, you can stop it by throwing data onto an obsolete desktop computer in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with your back on a broken computer and feet in spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh my God ...
