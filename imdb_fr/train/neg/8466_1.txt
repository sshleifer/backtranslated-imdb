I miss the words. <br /> <br /> And it's not commonplace. <br /> <br /> Done correctly, it could have been awesome, funny parody of science fiction B-movie, but unfortunately it was not to be. Rarely in the field of theater, so many competent actors have fought so much in vain with such a scenario of canine breakfast. I can only subscribe to the comments of the previous comment - clean the bathroom. In fact, NOTHING except watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive points: the nose of Lucy Beeman. Negative points: Everything else. <br /> <br /> The most relevant line: "It's not going anywhere". <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could meet such a destiny.
