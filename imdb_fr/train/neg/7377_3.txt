Even though the plot was very detailed and the plot was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals' voice was dubbed by someone else during most of the movie was painful because you did not know who was talking . There were many parts where he began to speak in his hoarse and deep voice, then the next voice spoke for him. I do not know why but if he had trouble with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could have filmed the events that did not contain his own voice once he would have recovered. I rated this film 3 out of 10 depending on the quality of the film. When you pay for a movie, whether in the cinema or on DVD, this movie was not worth the price of entry. I am a long time disciple of Steven Seagal and all his films that he has made in recent years. To date, I think it's one of the worst we've ever seen.
