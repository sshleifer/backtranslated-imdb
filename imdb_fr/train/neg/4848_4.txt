I like a good war movie and I fall into the category "summer there, do it". I would like to think that my opinion is correct (in my humble opinion). As I just watched this movie on DVD, I can say without fear that it was a pile of rubbish. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> It started by shouting on TV saying "you would not do that", etc., but I quickly realized that I needed a little work experience would an obstacle so I cooled a little. But on the opening stage, when the trailer wheel fell, I had the unpleasant feeling that this movie would be a predictable failure ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic in the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents at the other end of the command line or remote trigger. So much so that I let myself scratch my head all the time. Then, just when you think you know where the story is going, the guys from Humvee go off as they please in the desert. One of the most valuable assets of the market scene is to meet aspiring entrepreneurs from SAS. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene is so laughable. It made no sense and made me want to go out at any time. Then they put my patience to the test so long. It started with the "Contact Right" and came down quickly. If you had a British accent, you were hit, but if you were part of the EOD team, you suddenly had a big shot and saved the day. Then, as you thought, the film stretched over an inexplicably long time without adding anything to the story. You're just looking at it and wondering why it's not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the liquor scene in which they hit each other to laugh ... another scene where you just wanted it to end. It does not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, my life looking very boring, the main star is out of the wire to track down someone. This most ridiculous scene I have ever seen. It defies logic and ability to write a good script ... it was insane and awful. I still do not understand why they lost their time. Watching him running in the busy streets before returning to the camp made me laugh on the floor. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story is ubiquitous in the series without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be silly and illogical EOD scenes, but then it went on a fictional run trying to be something different. But as hard as I tried, it just bothered me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed in a series of stupid and senseless action scenes. <br /> <br /> It's impossible for me to recommend that. Maybe my work experience compromises enjoyment, but even the naive must realize that it makes no sense. The only thing more dumb than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which has to be the 24/7 work of the ticketing team that seems to use this website to make everyone believe world that he is good. Sorry, this is not the case! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will only annoy you.
