I always wanted to see this because I love cheese horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure that "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not the case. I mean, acting was a lot of fun, the screenplay had some bad classic lines and the special effects made it sound like someone was sneezing on the main actor. I should have loved him. Unfortunately, it's really slippery between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while completing my tax return. This is how boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you like bad movies, you'll enjoy the dramatic outing of Fat Nurse and the stellar play of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he has to deliver incredibly iniquitous lines with an impassive face - like the conversation he has with his wife to find the man IM: <br /> <br /> "I'll find him with a geiger counter. "" Is it radioactive? " "Only a little." </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> in indeed, the plot would have prompted Dr. Ted to look for a great zombie killing machine armed with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails when he discovers a big pile of poop on a tree. "Oh my god - it's his ear!" Dr. Ted said to the audience. I'm so glad he clarified that. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm making this movie rather funny. It would be like it was only 10 minutes, but unfortunately, it's still going on and the Incredible Incredible Melting Dude strives to make a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were really stoned, you would probably like it, but do not have pop-tarts during the movie, because the main actor really looks like the one near the end.
