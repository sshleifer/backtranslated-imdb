I was expecting a French musical B-Movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche and DeFunès were superstars of low-budget French films of that time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible hour of pure mediocrity. The music numbers are awful and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? This is just a succession of bad numbers, one after the other. The only thing very rare about this thing is the nudity of women. It was not familiar at that time. In fact, some numbers are only there to show us topless women. This adds to the mediocrity! And try to find the young Michel Serrault, future great actor of French cinema, partly musician, in his very first film. Good luck!
