It is a thriller typical of the "perfect crime". A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, unaware of all clues, knows immediately who is the culprit. The audience has to wait for the whole film until the culprit is caught. The result is like every episode of "Columbo" or "Murder that she wrote". The director himself refers to the story of the hackney by showing the policeman an episode of Matlock! This story occupies barely 90 minutes, but the director insists on using the 120 minutes with each shot of the book. Jump this one, you do not miss anything.
