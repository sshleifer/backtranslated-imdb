I do not know why I keep doing this to myself !! I continue to defend Dutch and Belgian cinema and say that it should give more credit and more chances ... and then, they slap you with garbage! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever done in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, clearly based on American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers have aimed very high with that, but have fallen very low. Intensive care has become an embarrassing product for everyone involved and is therefore a cult film here. It is almost impossible to find an original copy of this document, which appears only on special occasions, such as "The night of disgust". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even create a plot ... then turns into a lame and scruffy movie, with macabre makeup effects - yet very hilarious and cheap. The whole casting game is abominable, although some respected names are involved. The main male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy could just as easily be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, TV show host and idol of many young girls. He never mentions this thing in which he played, however. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself that intensive care has never happened.
