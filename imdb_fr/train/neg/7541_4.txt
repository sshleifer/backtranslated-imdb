great mystery, but the movie comes down the hill. The beginning is promising with a car accident and a woman and her daughter burned in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized because of this and we see him popping pills. A mysterious letter from an ex-girlfriend asks for help to find her missing daughter. Ed goes to an island commune composed mainly of women. They do not like strangers. We see a lot of fills with Ed looking for the girl around the city. This made the film too long. It ends up a little better towards the end when we learn the crazy rituals performed by the woman and finally the sinister plan that awaits Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a well written and lengthy story. FINAL VERDICT <br /> <br /> I would skip this.
