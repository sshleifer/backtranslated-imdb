The fact that I do not like music is a very personal opinion, not the sense of historical innocence. I realize it's an opera and not a documentary, but it misses some important aspects, especially if other people comment falsely because of it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the brain of this operation, which was organized. and reorganized following a discovery aboard the ship, to release 50 terrorists from Israeli jails, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a heinous terrorist whose story can be found by searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, although he never set foot on Achile Lauro. Bin Laden never landed on planes that hit the WTC, did he? <br /> <br /> *** possible mess *** <br /> <br /> The film almost excuses the actions and reactions of terrorists because of the horrors they could have lived, accentuating and exaggerating always what the Israelis did to hurt them. However, they never describe the harm that the Palestinians caused to the Israelis. The film uses (horrendous !!!) images of the horror of Sabra and Shatila, and nothing is said, underestimating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was the Syrian-Lebanese army that directed the film. massacre. <br /> <br /> The acting was generally very bad, but I guess that's what we can expect from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On another note, I am shocked to see how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage had tried to rally the 400 hostages innocent against armed terrorists, adding that this person should not be considered compassionate because she was a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how unsympathetic his wife was and spit on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw her body into the sea. I hope nobody in the world is so cruel as she (wink wink)
