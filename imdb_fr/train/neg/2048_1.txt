1 is quite generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, even if it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the jacket of the DVD and we all know it! It scared me. But this film is something else. Directed by a guy who has been around for a long time and made a lot of movies, it looks like he was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old boy! The story and the game are atrocious! David Hess, you've let me down too. After playing one of the most threatening villains in the history of cinema, did you resort to that? However, the story and the game of the actors could have been forgiven if someone had taken the time to give the video a somewhat professional aspect. There are LOTS of movies shot on video that look bad, or at least not so obvious that it distracts your attention from the movie. I can not say it's the worst movie ever, because I could not go through the whole movie, but it's certainly close.
