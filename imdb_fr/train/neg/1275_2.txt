It's a horrible film. The three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line that is useless and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and a lady. Some things do not make sense, but hypnotism makes up for that. The second, with the bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate, should not be perceived by anyone. The last, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which, I suppose, makes it better than other garbage.
