Jet Li is one of the best fighters in the world. He has been around for more than 20 years and is ashamed of others in the genre. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be an epic movie for him, but he fails terribly. First, it is doubled. Although this may have a camping value (the dubbing is not even close and it is flat), this seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Second, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans see Jet Li's films for fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so quickly that you do not even know who is half the time! At other times, a scene is left in abeyance (ie Li begins to pierce the ground of a jeep, while the badguys arm their weapons, two seconds later, Li and love are already under the car!) are so improbable, that they pass over to the point of being completely ridiculous (killers CD Roms - just give it stars that throw !!!). Li needs a director less inclined to the machine gun technique and more to the creation of a cinematic scene. The added rap / techno music goes from being acceptable to intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but all are spoiled by caricature characters that remove any credibility to which this film aspires. And do we really believe that love would not recognize Simon because he wears a half mask? The hair, the lower jaw or the voice would not you give it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This mess is a waste of time ..... 2/10
