If ever a film deserved a big zero rating, it's that pile of shit. I love zombie movies and even bad movies usually have an interest, but not that atrocity. In fact, I started to feel angry watching this movie because it's so unbearably poor that I can not believe the people in charge think it's acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and the non-plot is cut. with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act, or look like humans in any way. The entire film is also shot in two poorly decorated rooms to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be. The whole thing is a useless jumble, it's not going anywhere and when the zombies finally show up, they look silly and do not do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie than this one, so could you and so could someone who has never seen a movie before. It's pitiful and arguably the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You'll notice by the way that the only positive reviews give a 10/10 and invite you to BUY the DVD. I can not imagine a neutral person really thinking it's a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and it's generous.
