The main reason people still worry about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." it is that he presents Peter Sellers in a supporting role. Watching this movie and seeing Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers plays Amphibulos, a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the poor island nation of Gaillardia, a former British colony, now hosting many Russian troops. diggers at the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to put the interests of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union against each other for an easy profit, "everything is very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is the main character, a lazy British diplomat eager to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, all appearances are on the contrary. <br /> <br /> The positive opinion of this author is the following: "The reason why this film is considered average because the comedy is underestimated". I would say that the reason "Carlton-Browne" is considered below average is because comedy is non-existent. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening establishing the only two assets of the film, a very arrogant Terry-Thomas. and John Addison's complete score, things slow down quickly into a series of slow burns and jokes of poor communication. Carlton-Browne's bad opinion on the part of his boss and the darkness of Gaillardia (which no one can find on a map) are defeated. By the time we actually reach the island (after a series of tiring jokes), expectations are pretty low. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist in Latin America or the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that its guard of honor vanishes at the airport, and the billboard collapses in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still pulled by horses, allowing a thick-set announcer to leave another bold gag: "In wartime, the army uses a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never really get to the center of the stage, even when we're on their character's island. The plot is taken over by Ian Bannen under the name of King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his role as straight as it is written. That would normally make him the likely target of stolen scenes by Sellers, but trapped behind a thick accent and a greasy mustache, Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him much happier. in two other films made that same year, "The roaring mouse" and "All is well, Jack." <br /> <br /> Strange that this film, like "Jack", is a production of Boulting Brothers, with Roy Boulting co-director alongside Jeffrey Dell. Usually, Boulting's films combine a perverse social satire with an insane comedy, but here there are only two-way shots. Amphibulos uses his mutilated English ambience for the best of his value ("This man is like, you say, the bull of the Chinese ship"), while Carlton-Browne is generally debauched by his superior more than he seems to deserve . <br /> <br /> The weakest and most prolonged element of the film is the romance between the young Loris and Ilyena. Luciana Paluzzi, who plays the role of cousins, is never discussed. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a staged revolution whose surprise resolution will not surprise anyone. , and a last action of Carlton-Browne that seems to literally block his coffin. Apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.
