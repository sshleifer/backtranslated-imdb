This film was presented as a comedy and a mystery. He fails badly at a time. The only mystery here is to know why someone would make such a badly constructed film. The only comedy is the laughter I had when I saw how readers ranked here. Could there be two movies with the same name? The film I saw featured a girl with pretty blue eyes and a missing plot. <br /> <br />
