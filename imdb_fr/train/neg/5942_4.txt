If this is supposed to be a black experience, let me out, either through the front door or through the back door. <br /> <br /> One day, a mother's boy sees two young balaclavas go by and from then on, everything is at its height. . Angela Bassett, the most brilliant grace of this film, plays her mother too protective and religious. Despite her anger at the evolution of her life, in the middle of the photo, she really decides to accept it. She allows her friends to come in and suddenly, it is permissible to use blasphemy as long as it is not in front of the children. <br /> <br /> It's a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed out loud at the end, when Bassett was accompanying her son's body for burial, she said that her life was cut short at age 24, he had become a man . What a man? He had been convicted, had written the most atrocious rap with constant vulgarity, and despised society. This scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what is going on in our schools. Total and total lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The rivalry between gangs on the East Coast and the West Coast is never fully explained. We only see firearms on fire. <br /> <br /> A terrible image doing nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible models are these rap singers and their foul music. The African-American community should take offense at its very being. Who was this big classless slob who portrayed Biggie? In comparison, he made Rerun appear from the old slim television series. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that turned this chubby little boy into a vulgar monster he was. What a deplorable situation when we call it movie entertainment.
