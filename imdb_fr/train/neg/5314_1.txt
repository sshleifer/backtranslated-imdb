A music that kills nerves like nails on a blackboard, acting in such a zombie way, it was a shame to spoil the cast by not making a second film; in which everyone is presented as real zombies - with the cast of Sabrina the teenage witch like the heroes ... a film so horrible that if "stoners" were still there, it could be considered a cult movie - - so amateurish, the scenarios could have been taken by the actors, their lines read as they dragged themselves slowly in the film - banal and illogical decorations inspired by the sub-divisions of LA, accessories straight from ToysRus! Has a film ever been filmed totally and totally inept ??? Logic floats in the wind in this painful, senseless, pointless march and with a "monster" so stupid and so uncoordinated that he could not catch a turtle in a cooler - lowcut, leggy - and amazon! This caught my attention; The way a terrible chain crash going on in the fog involving multiple vehicles continues to monitor us all the way through ... like a ridiculous fight in a prison on another planet, a mentally unbalanced, sexy and unbalanced bounty hunter pursues a fugitive delayed extra-terrestrial --- EARTH! Do not let anyone p ** on your popcorn, you might actually like to watch this one. It's so bad!
