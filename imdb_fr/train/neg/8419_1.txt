I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a long time ... with all of its critical acclaim, nominations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the movie was good! It really represented the black music scene at the time. However, as the movie progressed, my whole family and I were tired of our minds. The songs kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have been profitable with RENT. <br /> <br /> In addition, I noticed that there was little character development in any of the characters; I did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of an overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just could not feel any emotion for this character. The characters were trained in singing as children and so on, but their personalities were not revealed enough to attract me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not important enough to attract the attention of the viewer, which goes hand in hand with the lack of character development. This film made me think of a copying movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall, I think this movie would be best for someone who does not really care about a story in general, while enjoying two hours of fun and entertaining singing performance.
