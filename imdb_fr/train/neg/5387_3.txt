In an instant, when it seemed interesting, it never happened there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, without any point (if there was one, it was very boring). There was no action, no suspense, no horror and the characters were rather cruel, so there was no concern for what had happened to them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was rather boring. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that this is not an unstable camera work and if there was music, it did not bother me like very bad movies and acting was not horrible.
