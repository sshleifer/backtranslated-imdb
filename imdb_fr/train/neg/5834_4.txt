I observed the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lb and House, MD .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially out of choice, similar to the character of Laurie House, but without the bitter spirit that Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, Tucci's "straight guy", the emphatic Seger, has not become a more interesting character, like the fallible "straight" Cuddy and Wilson. Adriira Varma's character, Adrienne Holland, looks too much like Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Someone from CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD and asked his staff about her similar show, hoping that mimicry would be successful. However, copying a show like House requires the same high balance of wit and suspense, and Tucci and his company are simply not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the show was canceled before reading the comments on IMDb, but that does not surprise me.
