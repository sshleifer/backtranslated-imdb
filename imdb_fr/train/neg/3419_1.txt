OK, then, Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to get this following. I have a question, why? Who read this script and who said, "That's great! Original!" This film is a regurgitated shit that I would not tarnish my bowels of toilet. Of course, that's another story, in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, etc., in which Chuck Norris is, of course, the only man able to share the same America with some bad guys. He does not even need a gun most of the time. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that reassures the mind. Big surprise that the only son who directs Norris films is Eric, Chuck's son. Eric Norris has mainly worked on all of his father's movies and television series. Does not this strike anyone as a sign that he has no talent as a director? After all, he runs the same people as before in the same stories as before ... The only difference is the characters' names. If this is supposed to make me patriotic and encourage the United States, our country is in a much worse situation than I ever imagined. Hopefully this will be the highlight in Chuck Norris's acting casket.
