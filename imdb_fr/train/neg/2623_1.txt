Sly Stallone is not the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, throw these awards now! Frank, the red-haired muppet, seems to think that every role he plays plays the role of American-Italian wise refugee of the "godfather". Please, someone makes him an actor offer "he can refuse!" This film is just farting the lead, even by the terrible overuse of it, Frank still steals the dishonest maneuvers. All people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and raising their arms, gesturing savagely in a style that has become outmoded with silent films. <br /> <br /> The plot, what there is, is, It makes no sense, because a meteor lands and turns all women into crazy nymphets, but as it is a film of 15 certificates, it simply means that they undress and make moan like dogs in heat. In the end, I'm not quite sure of losing my desire to live long before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and watch Deep Impact for a reasonable movie on a meteor about to reach the earth. <br /> <br /> NB Reminder: when one of the women is wearing her underwear, she has her panties under her suspenders / suspenders, it is panties on the suspenders to allow women to wear their underwear go to the bathroom with less hassle. A trivial point, perhaps, but that shows how silly this movie is when they can not even get that right!
