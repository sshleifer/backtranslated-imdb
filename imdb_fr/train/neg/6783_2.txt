There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 to 10 star reviews presented here by people who have never written a review of IMDb before or since. Given the very low average score given to the film by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie. I'll admit it, I found the concept pretty cute and I was delighted to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony in Angel and find work, but it did not take long for the film to become appalling. known. <br /> <br /> Acting: The tracks seemed pretty competent, but everyone? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: Case full of holes allowing a truck to pass. <br /> <br /> Meaning: nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Humor: did they really think people would laugh? Oh my boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. there were very beautiful women in this film. Not just the three main female characters, but all the elements. It was as if the producers were hoping that the set would keep viewers so distracted that they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they fail miserably. <br /> <br /> In good hands, it could have been a classic camp cute but very funny. It was not even close.
