"Lies" tells the story of an affair between an 18-year-old student and a 38-year-old skinny married man with the pair of protags who spend about half of his time on the screen indulging in scenes of naked sex and lashes, the other half sneaking through the pathetic naive scenario that seems a bit more than an excuse for sex scenes. With a very low production value, including obvious fixtures and dummy sex, a story mixing comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes redundant and superfluous. With a duration of almost 2 hours, subtitles and so little content, "Lies" is just not recommended. (C-)
