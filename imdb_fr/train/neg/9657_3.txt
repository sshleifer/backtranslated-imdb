1) I am not an arms expert, but I can even see the difference between US Army rifles during the First and Second World Wars. In the film, we can see soldiers armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), that the soldiers use until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can charge 1.5 times more ammo and 3 times more firing rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires a reload after each shot. Little difference ?! 2) The uniforms of the German army also borrowed from the year 1940. Especially - the helmets. The German helmets until the end of the First World War have a big pike in the lead, we can not even see one in a movie. And if we do little more research in the archives - what is the veracity of this "true story"? I am surprised to see how "truthful" can be a filmmaker looking for a cheap spread.
