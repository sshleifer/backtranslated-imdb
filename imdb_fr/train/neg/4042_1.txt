This film is beautiful to watch, but it's like watching a very bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) does not make sense. But it's very "artistic". Numerous shots of half-dressed actors arguing and looking deep into each other's eyes. Many artistic photos through the windows and with people out of the frame. Mumbling and wandering people with nostalgia. Persistent close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you arrive at the trio on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be the father-son relationship, but you just want the two to go down and get rid of it. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without a shot, your wish has been granted.
