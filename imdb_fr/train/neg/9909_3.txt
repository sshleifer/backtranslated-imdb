It was not a well done western. You have this walnut dropping in the hot sun in a stroller with a parasol on it, killing people for its own reasons. You have this same person sitting in a snow cave during a snow storm, cutting pieces of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of a place where you shoot wolves who are not there. What is the purpose of this film? Could not Bruce Dern find something better to do? It was a waste of film.
