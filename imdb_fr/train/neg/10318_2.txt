Who likes terrible "comedy" shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two types of people I can watch who look at this are: First, self-proclaimed Muslims and self-proclaimed liberals from all ethnic groups who are so thrilled that there is a program on Muslims that does not matter if she is good. or funny at all (which is not). Two, older people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, and not joking. <br /> <br /> The CBC really needs to look at what it does and its audience. If they continue to write only comedies for very old people, then guess what will happen, their audience will die soon and they will have no audience. I would be curious to know who writes even for this show? Do you think they are in fact Muslims, or hipster and funny? No, I bet it's old whites who are writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC programming since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you watch the CBC comedy series, Air Farce I've only got the air (thank God!), but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer we pay, not to mention this poor excuse for the Little Mosque "comedy" on the Prairie. It's supposed to be offensive and funny? Only the CBC could think that this lame show is offensive or amusing. Radio-Canada would be ashamed of wasting our tax dollars on television shows that few would bother to watch.
