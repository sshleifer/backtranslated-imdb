Everything starts with a good rating, then hesitates quickly and drops expectations. <br /> <br /> The characters of Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly built before the boss of Mac decides to take it with three flight attendant. . The rest of the drama talks about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought I was wasted in the role of a sullen cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad and can not stumble over furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only way to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is sometimes funny, but in any case a DUD (the songs are boring) and a major disadvantage if you hope for entertainment and a comedy healthy.
