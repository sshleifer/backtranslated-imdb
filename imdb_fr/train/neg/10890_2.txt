I thought this movie was pretty bad. If you are looking for cheeses, you may like this. Myself, I do not care about a good amount of cheese, but it was ridiculous. The progression of the film bored me and the scenario was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only fun thing about this movie was the day zo glo, but even that's not a good enough reason to see this movie.
