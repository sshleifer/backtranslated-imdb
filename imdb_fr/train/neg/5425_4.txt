I had Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was there (I thought she was great in American Gothic), but unfortunately she did not play a very important role in this movie. It starts well and the pace is good ... but in the end, it starts to get a little tedious and boring. That's not to say it's a boring movie, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I did not like the "possession" side and there were no decent scenes. In addition, the main story was very confusing and the end does not make much sense. However, I loved the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she took revenge on her executioners. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to make you drunk.
