I had never posted a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify its gravity by trying to think of it as a kitsch or a parody. But this is not the case. It's really, unconsciously bad. It is a serious attempt that fails gloriously. Other critics have pointed out the many flaws of the film, so I will try not to repeat them, but I strongly encourage you to watch this film. All this time, I was speechless, panting with disbelief, or I was rolling on the floor with hysteria. I have not had so much fun watching a movie for years. In fact, I will try to make all my friends see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur goes to audition -go boy (his dance is amazing) - Free nudity (the director / lead actor just needed a naked shot) - The preacher's desk with its cardboard and pencil rendering of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palms and forgotten rings (what narrative function does it play?!?) - The wrestling match of the ex-wife with Ben to get possession of his firearm - The detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; he is apparently burning it with this incredibly lean match - Yes, the religious-fanatic gay brother with his discolored hair and WeHo clothes - And, my favorite, using Joplin's "The Entertainer" as his opening soundtrack and "Pachebel's Canon in D Major" as background music! - the list goes on and on again - to SEE ABSOLUTELY !!!
