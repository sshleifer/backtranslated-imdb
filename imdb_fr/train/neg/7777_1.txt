This could be a cute movie for kids My grandson watched it once. he watched her a second time. I watched some of them with him. <br /> <br /> When the little bear gets lost in the ice cream parlor and he's in the water, he tries to find a piece of ice and says, "Go idiot idiot". <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like this. <br /> <br /> That's why it is classified for children. Should be suitable for children. That's what I would expect. put by the Warner brothers and G rated I would expect that this does not contain incredible words. The words do not even match the movie in most places as it seems added later. And the film hangs in many areas.
