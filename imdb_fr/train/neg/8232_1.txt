Five on the eyes are worth nothing on the wrist, I must admit that at one time, I was really worried. For about 30 seconds, nobody made any noise and I thought that my speakers had slammed or that I had become deaf with howling and screaming, me and the speakers, everything is fine now, thank you for l asking, oddly enough, it was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time telling you the plot, read other reviews for that. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD but have not yet unpacked it, do not get it back and ask for your money, I wasted mine, do not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was screaming on TV "They are here in the car, look for the camera lights and get the cameraman first", I forgot the big words, but you can guess or they will. . <br /> <br /> If anyone wants to buy this movie (it's really good), it's up to you for a dozen books.
