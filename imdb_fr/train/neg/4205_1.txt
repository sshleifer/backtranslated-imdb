THE ALARMIST is so abominably written that you've already wondered why a promising actor like David Arquette has agreed to be in the movie. It must be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without any mood, it borders the tedious. The conclusion is terrible, which seems to happen only because the director was bored and just wanted to finish quickly so he could go home for dinner. Stay away!.
