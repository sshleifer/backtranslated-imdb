Is it not hilarious that a middle-aged man leading a pathetic life suddenly finds himself overwhelmed by outrageous magic, upsetting his life and making him learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula never gets old, does it? It's a sure way to make a classic movie! Just watch major hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must be Rob Schneider's line of action when he did semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed him with The Animal. Since I've already traced the plot through sarcasm, let me color it more: Schneider plays the role of a losing cop who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved by surgery ... by a delirious veterinarian who charges him with pieces of animals, making him look like a horse at inappropriate times, running like a cheetah, etc. This film is a little nicer than other movies starring Schneider (like another movie of the same storyline, The Hot Chick), but it almost sounds like they want the audience to hate it by doing so. the romantic star a reality TV star (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and inserting a cameo from Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing very memorable except the value of production. I just want to finish this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie may be appropriate, but when it comes to lines delivered exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There are a word for that - "treats." In fact, here is another word - "cheap".
