Lord! (and who comes from an atheist), this "film" is bad! <br /> <br /> many things have already been said by the columnists before (those who evaluated this article 3 and below) with which I totally agree, I would just add a few points: < Among the three guys who had to eat their own finished products of digestion, to be cut by an ax, raped by a broomstick, had the ball taken away - the ex-boyfriend undergoes them. worse tortures while listening to the endless and useless babble of the girl at the kitchen table (like us, but at least we have the pity of the mute button). <br /> <br /> The director cut the endless graveyard and the scenes reversed, our suffering would have been finished after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this film at least a bit bearable is Emily Haack's breasts (a point). <br /> <br /> forget that. do not buy it. Do not waste your time. and your mental health. my brain is so fried after seeing this, I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" right now.
