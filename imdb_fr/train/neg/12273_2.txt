PLAN B has the appearance of a quick, unedited, and letdown scenario for a movie with an exit attempt for the actors involved - an output that should have been removed from the beginning. This is another "comedy" based on the mafia that is nothing new and lowers the level of those who participate. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime leader more concerned about clothes and appearances than his business. control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is wiser than the earth and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni has crushed one of his debtors (who has just married the reader Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni entrusted him with the post of assistant in charge of paying the debt of her deceased husband by becoming the "criminal" Maloni. Fran is afraid of his own shadow and is unable to perform Maloni's tasks. Instead, she chose to carry her whackees to Florida to hide with her brother James until she knew what to do. This alternative to the assassination of the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! The end is quite predictable, like all the lines attributed to the characters in the script. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has produced many quality films and is one of our most talented actresses, but she screams and cuts her way through a ridiculous party that quickly becomes boring to watch . Paul Sorvino is, well, the type Paul Sorvino cast of other gangster movies. The support cast is also allowed to play on the balcony in the wider slapstick, imminently imminent fashionable. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being ridiculous and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes has to return to TV sitcoms: if this fragile story had been squeezed into a half-hour concert, she might have had a chance. Grady Harp
