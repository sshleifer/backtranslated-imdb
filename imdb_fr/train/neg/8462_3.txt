"Bullfighter" was manufactured in 2000 but it will be released in video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: The confusing scenario, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez and the disturbing editing? It must be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) making a mystical road trip. They meet a lot of crazy characters and also avoid the bad guys. The film looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, while trying to subtle, do not draw attention to them with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe stays in for 2 minutes at most.
