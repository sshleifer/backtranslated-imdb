Assuming that it does not end with a video output, it should cancel this title at any cost. Unless you are bored of good, well executed movies. I saw that last night at AFI Dallas and I left with 20 minutes remaining, just because I did not care (for the plot, not to insult the director ... it's awkward). When you can see a gaff only 5 minutes after the beginning of the movie (a cut, a broken window before shots are fired ... then the window breaks with the foreground), the situation gets bad. Let's just say that this is just an indicator of things to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'm sparing you all the details, but it's under average in all respects, even the half-empty game by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect him to play half-ass . And the scene of rape ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. NEVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
