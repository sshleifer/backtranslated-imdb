I did not even know it was originally a movie made for television when I saw it, but I guessed it during the time we spent. It has the same faded colors, bland characters and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform" that screams practically "special Afterschool". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> The labyrinths and monsters of Rona Jaffe (thanks) were created at the peak of Dungeons & Dragons, an RPG written by pens and paper that won the hearts of millions of geeks in America. I count myself among the so-called geeks, although I never played D & D, especially I attended one of his brothers. M & M was also created at the height of D & D's major controversy, namely: it was so captivating that people could lose touch with reality, worship Satan without knowing it, blah blah. I guess it was a legitimate concern at one point, although it was extremely rare, but the date of this film is horrible. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young students, who play labyrinths and monsters, to socialize and a little time away from social life. Except that M & M as presented is more boring than their mundane life. Here, nothing of the game's appeal is presented - and Jay Jay's request to get M & M into the "real world" comes from nowhere. It's just an excuse to drive one of the characters crazy, even if it does not matter at that moment. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different, but they are all rich, but they are all rich WASPy prey who have problems that no one really has. <br /> <br /> But things are going on, worsening more and more once. . The budget is terribly clear (I love the "Entrance" sign and the cardboard cutouts of the forbidden caverns). Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in the deadliest scene of all time, and the return to the top of the "Two Towers" is unintentional. hilarious. Tom Hanks moaning "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" made me laugh for minutes. Without a doubt the lowest point of his career. <br /> <br /> Do not think of it as a convincing satire, but as a laughable piece of garbage from the 80's TV, and you'll still have a good time. In other words, if you can stay awake. The majority is largely boring, but it's worth it for the failure of Pardu at the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. Not that he can get much worse from here.
