Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to represent. But it's just horrible. I'm surprised he got a decent overall score. The only reducing qualities of this film are the (mainly) marginal projection effects. Do not get me wrong, Gore abounds in this movie - but few effects really jumped me (like the "probe" anal ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I think this film was filmed on a camcorder. Go - rent a Betacam at least, I saw porn with better production values ​​(and a better interpretation). <br /> <br /> Play - suck! But not in the genre of Troma or Full Moon. <br /> <br /> History - artificial! But that's what you get from movies like these. Very cowardly! <br /> <br /> Sets and accessories - sucked! My 16-year-old brother makes more elaborate sets for our Halloween home. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - no! A horrible voice game (I should not even call it a role) and all other words are "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> / Splashes appear and they are not so difficult to spot. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this shit!
