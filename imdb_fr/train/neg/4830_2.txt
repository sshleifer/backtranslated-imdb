REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a political war movie, you'll make a point, but this movie was just crap. Horrible in every way. Terribly inaccurate in many ways. It's easier for me to believe that the President of the United States is getting dressed, piloting a fighter plane and shooting down aliens. It is easier to note the few things that were correct. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie was the best of the last 25 years. It was an excessive drift and seemingly useless, and his cinematography was sometimes debatable. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, utilities ACUPAT ?? did anyone verify that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you have to do extensive research, it's only five years before the release of this movie. I am a veteran of the war in Iraq and if you spent a day with an infantry platoon or an NEM squad, you would realize how much the B.S. this film is. To compare that to the platoon or the backup of Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why not just add Commando and Red Dawn? I think these could be more specific. <br /> <br /> If, for some reason, you can see past the incredible plot, the historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie might be fine. Nothing more. If you continue to hear "Oscar buzz", and have to add your own pompous criticism, go for it. As for me, I write to the director to see if I can recover my 131 minutes.
