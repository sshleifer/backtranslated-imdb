It was a movie I always wanted to see when he went out. The promos were catchy and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the film is not so good <br /> <br /> It has a lot of flaws <br /> <br /> > The beginning is good and until the murder, everything goes well, but the film falls flat when the song romance begins between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow <br /> <br /> Then the twist on the Govinda and Tabu's love leaves more doubts and flaws, then how is it that Govinda turns into a rich criminal of a poor villager? <br /> <br /> The last step back is also extended between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappoints The music goes well, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br /> Govinda plays a negative role and does it very well even if he does too much. Sometimes Karisma is good but sometimes irritates with her screams. Tabu is fine. Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between shouting loudly and acting. there
