Your mind will not be satisfied by this endless thriller; but who will want? A young couple spends the end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some extraterrestrials pretending to be faithful of the Church. <br /> <br /> A small apocalyptic themed release, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of brio and style of purely similar films. And that's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid - not only the doomsday, but the convent too. The villain of the film is a well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> This totally shamefull slapdash seems to be a mainstream 70s genre that looks so fun today. Anyway, the secret laboratory of the convent is a nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world; but the end of the world is not at all his pride!
