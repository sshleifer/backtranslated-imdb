... and even then, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this film (if we deign to call it that) is only interested in the freaks of bondage. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new (and I do not want to say * nothing *), and they will not enjoy the warm fuzz of anything familiar, loved or cherished. less than community theater, lack of direction, crap lighting, or any other value of production. It's definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" film making of the lowest order. I guess we could be grateful that at least they know how to use the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this relates to why this thing is so blatantly bad *. <br /> <br /> This is wrong because the young woman plays Bettie Page, a girl a little zaftig whose only resemblance For Queen of Curves, it is the black hair and the fringe of the mark, which can not bring anything beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for his film career before and since that damn excess, but not for the ugly excess itself, which consists mainly of a number of lovingly reconstructed B & D scenes sandwiched between terribly awful biographies The page has fallen from grace (so to speak). In fact, there is probably more information per se about Page's life in the opening and ending credits than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a companion film worthy of "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy movie at all. This is a fetish piece that is similar to one of the greatest pin-ups of all time and does it without class, without style and without real understanding of the character of Bettie Page. No true fan of Bettie Page will find this disappointing, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. If you are free, remember that time is money too. Yours may not be worth much, but I bet it's worth enough for you to regret losing time with it. That's it, I'm done, you've been warned.
