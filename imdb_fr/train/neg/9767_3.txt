I think if you're in the sixties, like me, you're forced to lose about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely observable shipwreck. The salvating graces of this quirk include a surprisingly relevant social commentary on the values ​​of the sixties with a number of relatively well-known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) sequences. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a feature film covering all the strong points (and more) of the problems between the children of the flowers and the establishment, then to entrust it to a couple hippies and gave them about $ 10,000 to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way, it really reflects how strange this time was, foolishness, too much idealism and the heaviness of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.
