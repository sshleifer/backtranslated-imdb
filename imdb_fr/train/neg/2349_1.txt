There was a big movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately it was not that. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey Biko's great charisma. The big crowd scenes of Attenborough are laughable. The Soweto massacre was not like that, three rows of children (some doing wagon wheels!) Walking happily in the rifles of the soldiers. With Biko dead, the film quickly falls into a joke. If the struggle against apartheid was something, it was a struggle of the black people, but we are all supposed to be seized by the flight of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was an honest man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important when it was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware of being in South Africa. at all. The Wood family dog ​​receives more lines than the darkroom maid. As the family escapes, the women I saw the movie with - one of the few (about a dozen blacks in a big full movie theater) - whispered: She was right. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a film of a white liberal, well-intentioned but somewhat inept, about the struggle of a black radical people. And really, South Africa needs well-meaning white liberals, just like a hole in the head.
