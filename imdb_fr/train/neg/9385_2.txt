The "Trivia" page on IMDb claims that the filmmakers protested because this film was redone by the studio to "simplify the plot". If that's the case, this effort was a total failure, because it's one of the most incoherent stories I've ever seen in a movie - I hate to see it before the plot be "simplified". <br /> <It's sad to see Warren with so few characters going on, even though he can not do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in the 70s mode instead of his glamorous costume of the Hollywood era, but it is sad to see her wander unintentionally through this mess that pleases her husband producer and producer. In fact, she would later meet and marry the director - who, you will see, never realized anything again, but worked strictly on television from now on. That should tell you enough here. <br /> <br /> I call it "interesting" because I have a penchant for American films of this period and this role adds a perspective to the fantastic 1971 production of Oates (Fantastic). - Lane Blacktop, The rented hand). But the "detective of the 1940s as a fish out of the water in the 1970s L.A." The theme, which is the only thing that the film really has to say, is sold way too heavy. A similar theme would be dealt with much more effectively two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. And three years later, Oates would play a tough guy in a doomed race and he would give his final performance in Alfredo Garcia's Bring Me the Head. If you have not seen them, do not waste your time with that!
