This movie based on the book is really horrible and a big disappointment. We have been waiting for this move for a month. Many movie critics were hoping for that. Even in the newspapers and on television, it made a lot of sense. On April 29, many people regretted that this film was really horrible. Why? First of all, the story was so monotonous. There have been many indefinite scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on. The actresses, out of Hulya Avsar, were not harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She plays better in comedy films. In this film, a kind of drama, she could not get rid of her previous role. And finally, the film is too short, only 66 minutes.
