it must be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991, it was superb. Since then, I've always wanted to see her but I could never find her ... ..in today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> let's just say that I was so disappointed with his unreal, OK, I knew it would not be an Oscar, but I still hoped it would be fun no brain movie in the mold of blood sport. Unfortunately, this is not the case, it is the Pooh <br /> <br /> with all the American rock and roll and the acting was so bad that it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> fake. <br /> <br /> this DVD cost me only £ 5 and I think I was overloaded with £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I will not have never this hour and a half back.
