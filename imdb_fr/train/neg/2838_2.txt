Pass Mission: Galactica and watch rather the original episodes of Living Legend. The network took Parts 1 and 2 of Living Legend and integrated them into the same plot with the terrible Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica has suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 television series. Fire in Space, by itself, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, look at Galactica, the original Star Trek, then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between networked science fiction and licensed science fiction.
