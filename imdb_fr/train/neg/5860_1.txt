It is difficult to accurately describe the terrible horror of this film. An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything that is even remotely recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "formidable"; Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have far exceeded their ability to have fun in this 82-minute misery festival. . Try to ride a plane! comedy style with a collection of moldy gags (Note to Joan: German doctors have not been funny since the Vaudeville) buried from their grave in the Catskills - this is bad enough. But this cinematographic crime is aggravated by River's directorial style, which can be described as "ugly", and by a cast of once-before-old has-beens, so eager to please, that they exaggerate even the weakest disposable gags. <In this Sargasso Sea, the sea of ​​sap is an unfortunate Billy Crystal in his film debut as the unfortunate protagonist of the film, Lionel. To look at Crystal in this picture is like watching a blind person walk through a minefield; Finally, the grumpy reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition, like a cheap joke after the explosion of a cheap joke. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on the type of audience that might really like Rabbit Test. Cabbages, molluscs and slightly backlit lizards are all potential candidates. But for conscious humans, thinking - I would enthusiastically recommend you bleach before recommending "Rabbit Test".
