It is astonishing to see how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's abominable or because, considering the collective powers of the creative team behind it should really deserve them, but because in each category she was named "Prizzi's honor is disappointing". Some would say that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston has lost it at this stage of his career, but I do not buy it. The previous year alone, he had signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a study of dark characters located in Mexico, which ranks among the best of his career. On the other hand, Prizzi's Honor, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent scenario, turns out to be a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a hit-man woman prefigures the insulting delusions that invaded Hollywood in the early 90s, but the scenario is too complicated for him even the motivations are wrong and, overall, the story seems uncertain: it's a romantic comedy. , a crime drama, a saga of gangsters, etc. Jack Nicholson (making a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but that seems unconvincing on the part of Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seem to be in paycheck mode, almost moving to the sleepwalkers' motion. way through some parts. Anjelica Huston, meanwhile, succeeds better, but her performance is sabotaged by the motivations of her character: she begins to be the victim of the disdain of her bigot father, she shows solidarity with her ex-husband, then becomes a vindictive bitch who wants his head a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film are faded like those of the early 70s and the direction given by Huston is as uninteresting as all the rest. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director eager to be acknowledged that it could have been turned into something better, but what remains is like a movie no one wanted really do it.
