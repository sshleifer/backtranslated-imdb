The first Cruel Intention, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth could they do so bad? Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this one, Amy Adams fears. She is terrible And could not they have found a girl who actually looks like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is devious, misleading and much more mean than Sebastian in the previous one. And what happens with the story? Basically, it looks like that ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad reputation at his first school, says the movie, although he does not mention anything about him and his love life, and of how he was with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly decides that he will turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (can I remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle giller says quote "you broke up with THE FIRST person you never liked because I said it - so how can you he was in love in the previous And he is all nice and charming, and all "good person", as he refuses the sex of the chick that his father was doing. <br /> <br /> 3- He makes a complete 180 , and ends In a trio at the end of the film, then seduce Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's terrible, and I loved the first one so much, I do not even have see the third, I hope it's better than this prequel.
