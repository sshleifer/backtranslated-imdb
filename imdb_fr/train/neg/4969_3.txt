First of all, it's not nearly as bad as some of the other waste produced by the Sci-Fi chain; that does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact, it's very bad, but it certainly had the potential to be much better. The flaws of the film come from the character's design, absurd additions to the story, visual effects, music and, more generally, the acting of actors. <br /> <br /> Regarding the character design, of course, the way our heroes and villains look like. Beowulf and the other Danes seem to be ridiculous Vikings, rather than brute force warriors - the helmet worn by our main protagonist is simply ridiculous. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange sprawling attachments to the elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is identical from beginning to end, but Finn - a useless acolyte - has achieved a twofold dimension, due to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also has an idea, because he becomes less pretentious. <br /> <br /> Like Finn, there are unnecessary additions to this story to make it his own, while retaining the source material. The crossbow that is good for Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast did not leave the board. In addition to the additions, there are omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terribly terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly designed and, as such, their representation on the screen is not credible. <br /> <br /> The music is overwhelming, especially at the death of the character. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the worst Sci-Fi movie to date. No, it's actually one of the best movies. Even if it's still good, it's good, it's a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is always wooden here and there. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you to watch this film and watch Robert Zemeckis interpret Beowulf's old story, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half of the story, and not the everything, which gives this film a three star review.
