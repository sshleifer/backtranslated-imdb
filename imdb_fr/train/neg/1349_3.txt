I received this DVD much more than 2 years ago and I decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know why it took me as long as I liked the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. Although it may have a vivid color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, it lacks some old things that remove this gadget from the toilet. <br /> <br /> First, Inspector Gadget's classic theme song and music are completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by creating a score that sounds the same way, but that still is not enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can be turned into a van. Plus, he looks much more cute and round instead of just cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and Brain and she has almost no appearance. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. There is something in a transformation formula and the use of Dr. Claws for some never revealed the harm, but that's all I have. What was the contract with the little giant Italian that I'll never know. It has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if it's a title, his latest trial is in no way packaged. And he stays in the force, so why the "last case" call is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is an affront to a big animated show strangely absent on DVD, but do not be fooled by buying the Inspector Gadget DVDs that you can. I sold it a few seconds after finally watching it. No child will appreciate or appreciate that or any fan of the old show that tolerates it.
