and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still seems to have been made for $ 50. You can tell, from the first to the last of the pictures, that he cared little about the continuity or plot of the movie, he was just happy to make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> The end result is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if he had just given a treatment. The end result is an infinite zoom on poorly made gore, and even more mediocre games on the metal. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a good budget, silly behind the camera.
