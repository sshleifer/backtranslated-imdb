Well good. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 is in "Masters of Horror", it's just the opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with "Cigarette Burns" but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's stupid, completely devoid of atmosphere and tension and it exceeds the hours reserved for it, despite a time of execution less than an hour. The scenario is nonsense, the characters are irritable and unattractive and the conclusion is beyond the absurd. <br /> <br /> And for the suckers who bought the DVD (one of them being me); Have you seen how Carpenter describes the movie? In fact, he is proud of it and considers it his best job for a long time. He praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious mistake that made it to the final cup, he simply said that he did not think it was essential to rectify the mistake and just let it go. be there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost touch. I sincerely hope to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I wish to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are impressive, however. Technically speaking, this film is first-rate, with lighting systems and effective makeup effects.
