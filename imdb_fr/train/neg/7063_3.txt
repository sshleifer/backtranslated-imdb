The guy did a lot of title design for several movies and I guess one day he said; I should choose a cheap scenario, try to put as much title as possible in a box (because I'm a title creator) and try to persuade people that it's actually a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen is for sure. If you want to see beautiful titles, go on some posters, do not waste your time watching them. <br /> <br /> It's a bit ironic, you do not think, have you seen the poster? the only part of his project that should have made the title work has almost none!
