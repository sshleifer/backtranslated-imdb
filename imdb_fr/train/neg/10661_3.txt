It's "The F.B.I." featuring Reed Hadley, with a cast of stars! The film begins with an accidental removal (convenient?), Which leads to one thing and another - which does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, USA". prison history break. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a TV show, but more "violent" (for the time). <br /> <br /> BUT - the cast is a trip! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to jail; His cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a magazine "Muscle"!) And William Talman (reading a magazine "Detective"!). Honest! You should know that, an early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, responding to the end "voiceover". If you do not want it to be suspended, do not miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian is doing well as a fugitive asthmatic). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955), Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
