This not so funny movie - such a mess of big stars, who seem to be so caught up in their own celebrity that they forget. John Cleese is the manager of the hotel who likes to dress. You almost fall from your chair with a helpless laugh as he dances in front of Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a delicate hat. The rest: FORGET!
