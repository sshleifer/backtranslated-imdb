Facts about the National Lampoon goes to the movies, aka The madness of the national movie Lampoon: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is mediocre, even by the usual norms of Lampoon. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one is going to see a movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished looking at it, I started to wonder why it's called "The National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" and why it was never designed. much less actually done. It would be like calling Austin Powers: "An American guy goes to the movies". What seemingly. He is not an American and he does not go to the movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's so-called "satire" are funny, and none are going to see movies, which is a problem. I had hoped it would look like the movie Mystery Science Theater 3000, but that's not the case. <br /> <br /> This is the first National Lampoon movie after Animal House, although the quality does not allow it. of movie. Badly developed, rough and amateur in every way, it causes headaches ?? This is not a good sign for a 89-minute film that seems to double its length. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. The really bad movies are usually renamed? and this little disaster falls into this category. It has two separate titles - probably to help try to promote it to people too stupid to remember how poorly the panning was received by amateur video critics in 1982/83. 'Hmm, the movie madness ?? I have never heard of this movie before! Praise him! And then, the achievement: "Hey, wait a minute, this is just the National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!" <br /> <br /> It was staged by MGM / UA, never to be released in theaters or on DVD; it occasionally appears on television a few times a decade, which is pretty much the only place you can find it. <br /> <br /> It is divided into three stories ?? a parody of videos about self-widening, butter and corporate cruelty, and movies about police brutality and cop-pals (I guess). In the first segment, Peter Riegert (Animal House) is a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does other things. I did not really know what because it was so boring that my mind started to drift. Until the sexual scene appears. <br /> <br /> The second part is devoted to an exotic dancer broken by a piece of butter (do not ask) who decides to become queen of margarine to be able to cut dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only fun phrase in the movie: "Only I can make love to my son!" If you think that does not sound very funny, are you right? it's not. And just imagine ?? it's the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> The third part is dedicated to a policeman chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his temper and shoot him. It contains a funny scene but it is extremely exaggerated ?? Only Lloyd is really humorous, his character is dry, compassionate and strangely surreal. The part where he stifles his victim and where the sweet policeman watches everything is revealed, at least evokes a small chuckle. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a group of characters as famous as famous to turn to low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and intelligent by usurping so-called stereotypes ?? the fault being that the film becomes an enormous contradiction, favoring the standard T & A instead of the plot; raw humor instead of spiritual dialogue; desperate performance instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors have been captivated by the material, whispering their lines, often so embarrassed that they can rarely look into the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, in a single line, and even then it was a heartless voice. Two giggles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other comedies worthy of the name seem to me to be classic songs. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoon Vacation series (or at least three of the four episodes), and their classic Animal House, but their A series of direct bombs like bombs like Golf Punks ( with this great comic book comic Tom Arnold) is a good illustration of why their magazine ran out over ten years ago. It really gets old, very fast. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see a new movie, titled Gold Diggers, come out with its "seal of approval". It's like condemning a film even before it's in the cinema ?? Maybe they should start not to announce their name everywhere ?? <br /> <br /> Distributor: "This film is bad, it's getting the seal of approval from the National Lampoon, which will teach you not to do something so horrible the next time." <br /> < Forget the death penalty. Just put a group of criminals in one room and have them watch again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain his putrid wickedness. I'm giving up.
