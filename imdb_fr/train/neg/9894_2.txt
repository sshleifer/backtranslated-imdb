I missed the beginning of this film, which may explain why I liked it less. On the other hand, I have been studying the fall of the Roman Republic for years, so I know the story. Again, maybe that's also why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film contains more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they have tried accuracy, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that sometimes they try to be historically accurate and that ends up being confusing. It's like throwing in Antonius's marriage with Octavia, then pushing back two scenes later. Why even talk about it if it is useless and that Octavia is never seen? And like calling Antonius by his current name (Marcus Antonius) in certain scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Aside from historical inaccuracies, the film could have been a fun watch. if it was not for the main woman. There is not an ounce of dignity in her. She is hysterical, dramatic and completely lacks control of herself. Instead of being a smart and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95% of this comes from mediocre actors, but 5% also comes from mediocre script writing. Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not look at Antonius and Cleopatra, you watched immature versions of Dawson and Joey from Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something about this period, look at ... something other than this.
