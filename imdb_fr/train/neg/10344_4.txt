Saw this film started in the early morning hours on the MTC. From what I saw, several problems appeared. First, adults have not aged like children for 10 years. Several parts of the film had problems of continuity and for some reason, the actor who played the youngest son seemed to be the eldest of the past 10 years <br /> <br /> The copy that I I saw missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge void with a black screen appeared. It's a shame, because even if the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell behaved well in the film. It is unfortunate that the big piece is missing, but what is here is visible. <br /> <br /> I just wish everything is intact. The scenario does not make much sense because the Bergman character is fired when the children are small, then brought back to care for them when they are adults. Some of the timelines are meaningless either. There is a stock market crash that looks like 1929 but children grow up to fight in the First World War. All actors in this film are doing well. I was just wondering what was in the slot 20 of the movie that I could not see because it was missing.
