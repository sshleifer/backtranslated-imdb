I thought that any horror movie with Orson Welles would be strange. Necromancy was, but it was a little too weird for his good. The film has a frightening impression since it deals with a group of satanists / witches in a small town and the attempt of a young woman to escape them. The director seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. In the final, there are too many unanswered questions. Worse still, the story being so confusing, it is difficult to find one or the other of the characters. It seems strange that Welles agrees to make the front page of this film, especially since it does not have much to do. Maybe one day, they will release a cassette of the catch and bloopers of this film. Now it would be really fun!
