Oh ... my God ... it's without a doubt the most biting movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie makes no sense. Add to that a mediocre staging, really strange scenes (like the one where the kid goes off over the ravine and falls there mysteriously), and a completely abyssal dialogue ("Look!" "Musta pissed his pants! "), And you get a failure. Not to mention that Mr. Atlas seems to be able to beat only chocolate bars. But that's part of the charm of the film. Sit down and look at it with some of your friends to laugh. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, because it's so BAD!
