This is a really awful LOCK STOCK clone with a stellar cast and a terrible scenario. I do not know why so many top British players have joined this junk, they had to be bought. A missing part of a scenario goes on forever and if I did not pay the high price, I would have disabled it after 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, this honor goes to the movie player "(I'm using the word vaguely)" (Gummo) half of my life) but this garbage is almost right there with her. Certainly one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen. Things like this remind Hollywood that they do not have the monopoly of really horrible movies.
