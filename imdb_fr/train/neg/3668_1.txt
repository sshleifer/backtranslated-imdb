This film is so bad that you feel almost contaminated by it. In fact, there is a great relief when it's over, relieved to be able to put the tape back in the rewinder and return it to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. Jokingly, I suggested during the rental that it looked like the kind of movie William Hurt would "call" for his performance. I meant he would not try very hard. But here, in a very large number of scenes of this film, Bill Hurt is on the telephone! Our awareness of this irony was the only pleasure we could derive from this confusing mess. Cinematography and editing are dark and confusing, the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very slight resemblance to "Falling Down", but this film had a disturbing plot, a writing and a remarkable acting, as well as an attractive soundtrack. "Tainted Man" is a kind of old European tourist trap broken down, and looking at it is like driving on an unknown road in an unknown country where you do not speak the language in rainy weather continues just after dark while the windshield keeps fogging. You have the photo? Do not understand this one.
