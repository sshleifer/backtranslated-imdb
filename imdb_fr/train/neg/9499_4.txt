I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing substance was discussed. It seemed to devalue ideas and provide nothing new. The film lacked wonder, romance or anything that could really lead to science. Most scientists appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. One woman said that her rewards mattered little, only children helped. She said that after a 10-minute scene where she explained all her awards. Play "humble scientist", are we? "I have equations dancing in my head," said another. I do not see how that explains something to us. He did not cover the significant effects of science on our culture. The politics of science has hardly been touched. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie for 10-14 year olds. Apart from that, I found that it was boring and not revealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
