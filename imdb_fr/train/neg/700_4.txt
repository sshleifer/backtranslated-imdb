I'm not looking for quality I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous bad movies that have been banned in Britain. It was initially banned and reissued in 2001 with a total cutoff of 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Some college students spend their Christmas holidays preparing a dormitory to renovate. There are scary characters lurking with the four children. Which of them is the slasher? The killings are not very bloody, so this nasty video is not really nasty. There is the blinking of crazy people, but it has nothing to do with college kids. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I saw too much. The final twist was smart; I must give credit to writers for this little originality.
