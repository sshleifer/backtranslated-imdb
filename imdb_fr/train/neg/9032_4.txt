I never understood Garbo's call. In her films, she always seems stuck, not so seductive and that annoying voice that would have drowned the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson far better left in the silent era. In this last film, his performance is very average and even uninsured. She's doing her best but everything is not working because the scenario is even worse than her game. <br /> <br /> It would be a comedy screw that is never credible and never takes off (even if Melvyn Douglas succeeds in ski scenes, which is really the only fun thing here.) <br /> <br /> There was a potential, but the script fails in almost every department, wasting every actor. Douglas and Garbo had good chemistry together, but this one is not even a place on Ninotchka, which I found extremely overvalued.
