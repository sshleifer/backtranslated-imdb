In theory, the "comment of the director" should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former TV director telling his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he would have worked on were "Bonanza", "Flambards", "The Duchess of Duke Street" and "The Bounder". His comments are not at all informative, because of his habit of going astray. <br /> <br /> But in practice, he failed miserably. It's a joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. The scripts are completely lacking in spirit, and Bryden fails to convince as an old man. Whenever he is stuck with something funny to say, like every five seconds, he gives a hissing laugh. Rather than being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old men seem hilarious, it's for you. <br /> <br /> This did not help that the mocked performances were, with the exception of "Mr & Mrs" and "Crossroads", rather good. For the joke to work, they had to be really terrible, such as Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telly Addicts, Neighbors and New Faces. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, we are spared the horror of future editions. Would not it be deliciously ironic that the "Commentary of the Director" is itself a parody?
