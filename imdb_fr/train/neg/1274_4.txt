It should have been a film about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and also glorious Olympia Dukakis. It would have been a movie to see. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a bit of Falk. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you hardly know it. I assume Reiser feels like he's a giant movie star who needs a proper vehicle. He is not. Even more annoying, Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then put them back into context. Dukakis does not display until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen shines. The story is about Falk and Dukakis, in fact, but we are subjected to a crazy, stupid and absurd road-trip in which Reiser has to show how cute, precious and so deep he can be with a psychological vision. (false!). For example, in a restaurant scene that Reiser was hoping to be "at Cassavetes", there's a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk that's so obviously ridiculous that I was embarrassed for Falk.
