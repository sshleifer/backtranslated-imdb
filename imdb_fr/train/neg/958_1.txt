How did it become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to start, why this movie sucked too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the game of certain characters. The film was too bright, they should have done something with lighting, for example. make the environment darker. The makeup of some dead characters made this movie a horror movie of 1970. It's 2006! People are not frightened by other people wearing heavy makeup. Most horror scenes come from other Asian or Hollywood horror movies. Total scam! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason so many people have shouted at watching this movie is because of compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it instead of the girl coming out of the television, she is now from the next window? No matter how you say it, I'M STILL A RIP OFF. If you want a good horror movie, check out the 50 best horror movies listed on this site.
