OK I own this DVD I have it again at amazon ... I mean, I think it's a hard and a pretty cool movie and that Melissa Bale the slut / bitch girl they pick up is hot as l hell ... the actor is bad and the whole Polt just sucks the clown is a huge guy wearing a mask and that is disgusting but ok, I would not recommend it if you wanted to rent an entertaining movie after a hard work day, but if you have nothing to do and if you are obese with these silly movies as I am, look at it from time to time, and I do not know how DVD craftsman has SICK in his DVD collection, sick is not good enough to be owned by a decent midway movie company OK and that's it
