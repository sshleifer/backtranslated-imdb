It's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and I'll praise any horror movie unless it's not done for the cinema. Looking at the box, it is indicated that it is rated R for gore and some language ... Where was the gore? Was it their only good death scene where you actually saw Gore? I could have forgotten that if there had been a brief nudity or a good dialogue. There was not even a distant line of mind or amusement in this lame film. Sometimes, horror movies are great because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
