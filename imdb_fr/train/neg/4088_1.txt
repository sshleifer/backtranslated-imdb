It was a decisive event in my film to watch life. I went to see that at the theater when he came out. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. Films like this make one wonder who put the money and who owed a favor, a great favor. The special effects are absolutely top-level, as all first year students could have done. Rubber toy sticks on ropes without trying to hide the ropes, arrows that seem to be drawn on the film and that look like the shape of an arrow that you will find on a road sign and a ludicrous story Ed Wood realized masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every film student should see this thing simply so that he knows the very definition of a bad movie.
