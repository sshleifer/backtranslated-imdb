Jill Dunne (portrayed by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive and likeable woman, dominated by an elegant-looking teenager girl, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a little husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), a young man to be fastidiously egocentric and odious. <br /> <br /> This was announced as a troubled family hunted down by a mad killer during a ruthless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not even happen before about the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it's nothing to send someone running to the storm cellar. <br /> <br /> Criminal harassment is not intense until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, argues until I just want to insult the girl in the next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv Did she get in touch with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they constantly get confused - in fact, Jill comes home to find them both on Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband, Sean, complaining to Jill or criticizing her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive - his face being so freckled that you could play, connect the dots. <br /> <The story begins with the fact that Jill was informed of an unpaid credit card bill for a hotel she had never been to, and that she thought Sean was never went there. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a handsome older man, divorced and friendly with her. In fact, when he sees her husband there again, he phones Jill and informs him. <br /> <br /> Jill comes back to the hotel and sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her and doing absolutely nothing. In fact, she does not even tell Sean anything when he gets home. It made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard his business card. So he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. She shows him a condo. Then they drink a drink and things get complicated. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill take on hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a little more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to retire. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have to confront each other about cheating. Sean complains about how Jill has let him down since his father's death. Apparently, his lack of morality is entirely his fault. Finally, Jill confesses to Sean his lack of morality and his almost-adultery - and of course, everything is his fault too, as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The little family decides to go camping - which means more moans and grunts among them, especially from the spoiled girl. <br /> <br /> I loved it so much that the stalker gets everyone except Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
