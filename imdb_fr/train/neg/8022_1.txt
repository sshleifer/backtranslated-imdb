I see that someone has already thought of a similar analogy, similar to the first thing that came to mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there but there was no conspiracy. In addition to the sexual scenes that bordered on child pornography (which, in my opinion, could have been edited or presented in a more evocative way in nature rather than in graphic form, I would say that this film is a recipe torn in two. ingredients, without instructions on how to assemble them to make a finished product From the beginning, the development of the character and that of the story are lacking ... unfortunately, several times, in this monotonous story, we are teased thinking "Ahh-OK ... well let's find out more about WHY this scene is going on ... or ... WHO is this character ... or maybe we'll finally get to know each other and to appreciate this character more ... or understand and get more involved in this inter-character relationship ... etc. "But unlucky! On the contrary, several times, I was tempted to extinguish it several times but to let it fall when the ca rotte was balanced, only to find that whatever mini-plot in w hatever mini-plot (and the one poorly presented) was just a trick. The reason I stayed until the end is a mystery, except that the IFC has better selections and has awarded it 2 and a half stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters are not nice at SOME degrees, or that you can not identify with them or their humanity ... it's just that it could have been so much better with just a little more 'effort. I notice that it was shot around Santa Cruz and I wonder if it was the project of a film school. I wish I could give this review a better review, but honestly, it was a frustrating and disappointing one-and-a-half hour loss.
