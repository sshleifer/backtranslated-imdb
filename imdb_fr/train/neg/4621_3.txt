After looking for this movie up and down, I found it the moment I least expected it, playing on the Sundance channel very early in the morning one day. Why I have been constantly looking for a little vanity project directed by Chuck Barris in the last years of the TV show, I have no idea. The movie is just horrible. The scripted part that deals with a week is. Of course, the highlight of the film is to see the real performers "too hot for television" or rejected for one reason or another. This part is always horrible, but campy bad which was nice in its own way. Now that I have seen what I have been looking for so long, will I look at it again in my life? Absolutely not !! Do yourself a favor and just look MUCH better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the show. The girl's number where it was enough to lick lollipops in a provocative way was fun, but having to bear to see Jay P. Morgon burst of light, the public has probably made him sterile. In hindsight, I'm so happy that it was a resounding failure, because if it had been a resounding success, there could have been a movie "The beauty show at $ 1.98" and THAT my friends surely would have carried away on the Apocalypse. > <br /> My note: D
