I may have missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good synopsis of this film? Take Aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then delete everything that was good about it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes after the beginning of the film, the team "V-SAN" (it's the stupidest acronym) I've already heard that it checks a "base" massacred by vampires, then they go down (a ladder?)? A ladder is obviously attached to a billboard with a visible train of today in the background. When is it supposed to take place? 2210. Okay ... (wait, I'll come back) <br /> <br /> Yeah. characters. Wow, well there's the lesbian Asian chick, the redneck wannabe cowboy, the altered captain, the vampire / hot topic goth part time cashier and the second in command. All are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. I was almost sorry to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Does not he make enough money by being Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Most of the original things about Vampire Wars relate to the seriousness of the situation. <br /> <br /> Looking at this new film birth, the only fun I had to do was the faint attempt at shooting. Since when do I register PCI computer cards on a wall is it considered a ready-made piece for a spaceship? The money needed to make this film could have been used in a much more rational way.
