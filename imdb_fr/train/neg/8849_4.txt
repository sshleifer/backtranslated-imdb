It's a very bad movie. But not so bad as his reputation indicates. The production values ​​are not too bad and there is a strange effective scene. And it has an 80s guipure head veneer, which means it's always fun. Also watch out for the brief appearance of Jimmy Nail - her attempt at an American accent is so amazing that she is fantastic. The breasts of Sybil Danning are also fantastic - they make a brief appearance in the film but the scene is repeated many times in the end credits of what can only be described as the 12-inch remix of Sybil Danning's breasts. As a horror movie, the effects are stupid and Christopher Lee fell asleep in his performance. I suppose he was buying a new house and needed money for the deposit. The two main characters - the man and the woman - were so insignificant that I had almost forgotten everything and had watched this movie a little earlier tonight. The werewolves are visibly less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, oddly, they sometimes look more like burnt apes. The European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, although it is terrible, gives at least cheese a little more cheese. <br /> <br /> Overall? Good for laughing. Not good quality but have you been foolishly expecting it to be? And at the very least, you still have Sybil hitters.
