No? I did not mean it! Well, in this case, all you have to do is stay away, very far from "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" because this is only the nth umpteenth unnecessary post-slash "scream" that does not has absolutely no redeeming value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are insensibly stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer" because the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motives are just as stupid. Why would anyone want to steal ideas like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery for me, anyway. At least, this film could depend on the precious support of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls of this junk are, except without brain, also terribly unattractive. One year after the still-unsolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simple-minded students travel to Florida to spend their spring break in an elegant beach house. The killer has not moved all year, but now he follows the detachment in Florida and begins to slaughter them while leaving behind the message as a business card. You really do not need to be a horror expert to quickly find out what face is behind an incredibly ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to get you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. Given that the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the subplots about Floridian's incompetent police force and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal account to settle. . Murder happens inexplicably on the screen (do not you hate it when it happens?), There is not even a free T & A to enjoy and you'd better not get into the quality of the dialogue. Such sufferings like this just make you realize that the enchanting spirit of the slashers of the 80s has disappeared for good.
