Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a group of rabbis inventing distorted machines to circumvent the regulations of the Sabbath, he does not really attack Judaism and seems furious when a rabbi challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the "holy books" of organized religion. This is the proof of his total lack of objectivity or concentration in the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> I find it really hard to believe that this man is atheist or even so intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious and make fun of them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he really tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way, it reflects what he really is not, and in doing so, he looks as stupid as those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the evils of religion and How can religion really hurt human civilization? Watch The Root of All Evil? from Richard Dawkins. It is a documentary with brilliant research, clearly describing what it hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's religious is not funny, does not ask interesting questions and gives no idea of ​​such a controversial subject. It seems to be the raging talk of an old man dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I feel almost sorry for him.
