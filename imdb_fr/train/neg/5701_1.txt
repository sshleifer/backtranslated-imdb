And so the great rewrite of the story continues in the Hollywood way. <br /> <br /> It was absurd and ridiculous crap. <br /> <br /> It shocked me that such an incredible sum could be spent on the most artificial and badly played inaccurate movie I have ever seen. It's appalling. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's short flirtation with acting seems to be over. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was a problem in a litany of dreadful movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was not a coincidence, she really could not play. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed to work on such guts. <br /> <br /> Only recommended for those who are recovering from a recent lobotomy or for those who think America invented the world.
