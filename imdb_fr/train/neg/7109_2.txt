Now I understand. The title refers to the immediate reaction of each member of the audience after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying to make too much effort to be terrifying, not having a good dialogue, even the slightest fear of this kind really make The Screaming Skull more like A Snoring Dull. Although the mansion and the property defined in black and white give a dark tone to the film, but that's about it. The only frightening thing about this flop is that people have actually made money with that! Remember the casket guarantee at first? This is perhaps the funniest thing I have ever seen on the screen. What is sad is that viewers probably hoped that director Alex Nichol had been forced into a coffin, nailed, and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny, placed in this horrible and unhappy situation, arouses no sympathy for a woman whose anguish is imputed to a haunted and cranial receptacle. In addition, her husband, John, speaks calmly, but it does not work and he finally proves how difficult it is by slapping a lame cripple! Ah, Mickey, the days before, you could get a no-go order against guardians of the estate like him. The approach of this type is not very good or maybe too much glue for aircraft. Still, despite his strange character, Mickey is probably the only good thing to do for this film that provides a slight sense of entertainment and I can not get enough of a guy who says "It was Mary!" and digging in pots in a greenhouse.
