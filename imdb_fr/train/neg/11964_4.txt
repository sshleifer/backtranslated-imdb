Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this extremely safe and comfortable drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which makes him look for his father (Alan King), an extra-cinema who thinks he's a big star. The script is a nonsense of Neil Simon with galore dudes, a flat and inexpressive direction of Henry Winkler (blocked in sitcom mode) and a family conflict at hand. Crystal and King do their best, but King is too impatient and often too high. JoBeth Williams has another of his ungrateful roles, but manages to bring his innate and distant class to the character of his proverbial girlfriend. It's a comedy, I suppose, but it holds tears ... shamefully. ** from ****
