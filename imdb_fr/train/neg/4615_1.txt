I may not have the longest period of attention, but this is the second movie I refused to see, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the director was making a big joke, so I was still waiting for a resolution, a reason to laugh, an interest, but that resolution never came. Instead, the writing was ridiculously amateurish, the film dragged on and felt disjointed, as if someone had cut a TV feature film. The academy had to take drugs when she proposed this film for no fewer than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second film that I refused to watch throughout. The first was "Exterminator". I hope that gives you an indication of the seriousness of the situation. 1/10
