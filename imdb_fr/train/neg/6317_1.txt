I do not know at all which idiot San Francisco invented this stupid conspiracy, but apparently they must get rid of all the drugs they take and put their analyst in danger - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yeah, It's a plausible story, if you consider the sequence of extraterrestrial abductions in "Life of Brian" plausible. <br /> <br /> This film is little more than a canal of left. If the United States and the USSR had abandoned nuclear weapons, the result would have been to eliminate the only real obstacle preventing both from engaging in war. Bad like Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the time, it was "proxy wars" that prevented the superpowers from directly participating. <br /> <br /> This film makes me think how realistic it would be for high school students to go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone said, "Mr. Chairman, some children of Drastic High do not eat!" and Ronald Reagan replied, "My God, I'd better revise my defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Would it not be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because it could not support the massive construction of weapons? Wait, it happened!
