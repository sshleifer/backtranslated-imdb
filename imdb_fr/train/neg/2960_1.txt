This is without a doubt the worst film ever created. There is no discussion here. That's it. End of the story. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, and seems to have been created by a three-year-old child fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just stupid. It is inconceivable that someone could suggest something so stupid and think it's entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your curiosity is morbid about the gravity of this film, do not make me describe it. Words can not say how horrible this movie is. It's not just bad, because it's a bad movie. Even these have a cohesion, if not an entertainment value. This. . . It is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its level of wickedness by 5,000, and you're still not up to the gravity of this movie. After giving a point to the movie Pokemon, giving a point to this film is nothing like charity. That's how bad it is. Have producers and directors even taken cinema lessons? Because it's a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It looks like this movie was made by a lover of paint thinner. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about renting it again.
