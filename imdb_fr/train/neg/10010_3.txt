The plot is not worth discussing, even if it alludes to corruption, murder, power and the rest of the thriller-related topics. The characters are interesting although sometimes. Not realistic but interesting anyway. <br /> <br /> The development is slow as a tea ceremony. The visual effects are not striking, but enough to relieve eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing too shocking, nothing too exciting. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight the inadequate conspiracy and do the job pretty well. The others are bearable although very predictable. The whole is visible and better than most TV shows.
