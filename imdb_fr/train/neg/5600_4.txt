FULCI experiments with science fiction and fails. generally in his non horror films, we always have a super gore sum, but not here. Sum of very amusing scenes, as when the prisoners are obliged to hold a bar for 12 minutes and that they fall, they are elected. the guy falls down and has some sort of crisis on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold him up lift him anyway. The city is an obvious model but not bad. and the end of the explosion is at best laughable. And do not get me started in terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
