It could have been a fascinating morbid look at the life of one of America's most notorious serial killers, but unfortunately it does not even look like it. Terrible edition, direction, bad game, name it. This movie is literally about 10 minutes out of 100. The only quality that buys is Bruce Davidson as a father, but it's not enough to save that stinky. A 1 of 10.
