Tarzan's latest film starring Johnny Weissmuller (who looks surprisingly old a year after "Tarzan and the Huntress") is bad, despite all the anecdotes that can be added to make it better. It is obvious that RKO has tried to make a great farewell to Weissmuller, by touring in beautiful landscapes in Mexico, with a star of the country (Andrea Palma) and the award-winning filmmaker, Gabriel Figueroa, and by bringing the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin. the score. Although filming abroad has cost less, it seems more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco's beaches and true pyramids like Aquatania, and presenting impressive scenery for all related scenes. at the temple of the god Balu (outside, built on craggy rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as a director, instead of Robert Florey, who gives very slow pace. Neumann had done an excellent job with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Huntress", and had completed his career as a director of the classic "The Fly" the year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career of some remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee who plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an unpleasant factor who sings dreadful songs (which look Caribbean, in a place supposed to be Africa and shot in Mexico!) Annoying and decidedly of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to Tarzan de Weissmuller.
