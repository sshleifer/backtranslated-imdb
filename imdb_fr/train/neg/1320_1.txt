This film was exactly what I expected when I read the cast. I probably could have written a more interesting script, it's a shame they left it to a group of howler monkeys. Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier, but he must thank God (and we too) for not having to rely on his acting skills to make a living. He can not play, he can not speak, he can not even move very well on the continent without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blond girl and that's all. Obviously, she was not chosen for her amazing skill in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. Nevertheless, I must admit that she could be the acting professor of Tomba because he is even a worse actor than she is, and it's funny, especially since she is not Italian. I laugh all the time watching this movie. I thought it was so ridiculous and meaningless that it really made me laugh, loud, very loud.
