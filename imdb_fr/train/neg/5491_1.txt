We should have been wary when discovering that two minutes from the lighting, we were the only ones. Only five others joined the group before the movie began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this film. The acting is awful (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is banal. The effects we have seen a million times. The direction of the film the worst we have seen. Snaking and disjointed. No one laughed, including the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been sooner if my wife had not gone for a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to watch in your cinema, buy drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and make people watch. You will spend a much more pleasant stay !!! <br /> <br />
