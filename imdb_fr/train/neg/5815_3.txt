I was really looking forward to seeing this film based on the glimpses and the press he received, but after watching it, I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally insipid film, mixed with a sort of disturbing family reality of Todd Solondz without the humor of Todd. The story lags and each scene is worse than the previous one. I may have missed the point, but if this film is an example of each girl's growing experience, I'm happy to be a man.
