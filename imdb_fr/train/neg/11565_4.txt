So far after the second week of "The solitaire of beauty", I am a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some actors play well, provided that it is only drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this drama is a "factual" cover of the "Thatcher" years - it's good as drama, but I think the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and following the drama and the following years with "Things can only get better" ending in 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting ! with this promise of a government bursting with energy.
