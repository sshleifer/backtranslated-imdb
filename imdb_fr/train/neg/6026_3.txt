* Critics may contain predictable spoilers *, <br /> <br /> campy, bad special effects. there is a TV movie feeling. The idea that the UN is taken in hand by Satan is an interesting turning point for the end of the world according to the Bible. the premise is interesting, but its execution falls short. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, make at least one quality movie! I was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck. I can not say more about this movie since I saw it more than a year ago, and there is not much to say about this movie except ..... skip -the!
