I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not one thing. The scenario is a nightmare. The author has blurred the line of demarcation between chemical and biological traits and does not seem to understand the difference. You would think they would have at least one technical advisor. The performances have been bad by most actors ... even if I do not blame them really ... the material really stinks. The editing was just as bad .. I will stop now .. it's all bad 2/10
