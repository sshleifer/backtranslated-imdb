I am actually surprised by the number of good notes that this pseudo-documentary anti-Christian got. Now, I respect the opinion and faith of the guy, I am not myself, in this state, believing in the Christian doctrine taught. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a bit of a different problem. <br /> <br /> This film has valid arguments, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend not to see it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And it's actually more of a chance than the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than a curious approach to the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that has affected his childhood. Most of the time, it also denatures Christians: incredibly naive or fundamentalist, without moderation. <br /> <br /> The director uses film scenes from Passion for Christ without permission, organizes an interview with the director of his former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I found that the director was the most down-to-earth man and I think his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that the Christian believers interviewed were consulted later or even informed before the interview of the subject of the investigation. <br /> <br /> That said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to know. found here and some very original ideas on the question of Christianity. But the way this thought is generated is often offensive, extremely unprofessional and terribly biased.
