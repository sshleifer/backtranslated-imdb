How could they do that ?! Presenting itself as a captivating comedy, the "$" ill-founded is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments. Warren Beatty, who is used to being reliable, looks drunk, and Goldie Hawn, who is hilarious, acts as if she were taking depressants. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can not save this litany of anything. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this film to "Plan 9 of Outer Space"? I would not do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotic but ends up being hilarious; it was done silly and makes you feel as if your brain had melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for that when they shared "Shampoo", but they co-starred in the awful "Town & Country". Maybe they should not just co-play in the movies. All in all, I'd rather have my skin torn off than look again. Awful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should do it again with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see him.
