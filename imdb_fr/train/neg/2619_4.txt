It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It is a little slow at first, but it ends with a burst of De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The positive side of the film for adults is the talking bird who thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's the comedy that the film needed more. Look at it in the morning so you do not have to pay the high price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
