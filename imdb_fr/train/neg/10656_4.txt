What can I say? A film by Kamal Hassan is horrible. It does very well, but it's a horrible story, with a horrible direction. In my opinion, the director Gautham Menon must abandon the staging. There are many tragedies throughout the film. Apart from that, you simply can not believe how horrible these crimes were. There was no practicality in the movie. Gautham is just running out of stories. But Kamal Hassan and Jyothika are doing very well. The bad guys look too ugly, even if their performance was not bad. I do not think it's a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with your family. You will not sleep seeing this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj once again did a great job, and that's why I gave this film 4 out of 10. Apart from that, an excellent cinematography. All in all, this is just a bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should have rejected this film.
