I have seen (too many) a lot of movies from this company - this one is in the middle of the pack. One of the good things is a little more stylized and mastered than some of their prices - less sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to history (at its true value). Many of their titles, like Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I found the simulated sex scenes less warm than some of their other movies (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is still a 10 on the peter meter, like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot at school, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Look at it with the remote firmly in your hands (free), a night where you need to take a break from porn. Do not waste your time trying to check the story - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a film, it's purely T & A, but not bad at this level.
