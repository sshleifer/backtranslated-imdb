Wow, this movie is not only a "new lesson of true bad taste", but also a lesson in "really bad shooting". Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence', but you also have to know when a movie is terrible. In case you missed the script, the plot of 'Zombie' 90 'is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals crashing into the wild, causing them to spill, turning the inhabitants into hideous zombies. The next thing you know, zombies are everywhere in the city eating people alive, while a doctor in search of gaffes and a government agent are trying to determine the disease that makes these people eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence". From that moment, all we see are zombies who have a day on the ground in all the places in sight - nothing but extreme and disgusting landings and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of tripe and of blood. As it is a German film, it was necessary to double the film in English and when we do not make fun of the frenzy that feeds the zombies, the voiceovers are quite hilarious and entertaining. Since the user UnclassifiedX mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that separates what is acceptable and what is not, hence the scene in which a woman who Carry her baby is turned A guy in his wheelchair and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. A zombie catches the baby and tears it up, eating his organs when you hear the baby crying. Wow, that's a new lesson from REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste. Terrible I tell you, atrocious.
