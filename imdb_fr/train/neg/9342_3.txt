To complete the release schedule of our group "Our Group" from 1929-1930, "A Challenging Winter" presents two scenarios. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, alone at home on a winter day, decide to shoot. Little Wheezer hands the instructions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Fun times happen when the rest of the group shows up to shoot the taffy - and ends up spreading all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second scenario involves Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / handyman of the gang, and his interactions with the gang. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, "A tough winter" has never been broadcast on television, although it is available in home video. The reason is the characterization of Stepin Fetchit which shows a sneaky, devious and slow character. The producer of "Our Gang" Hal Roach called Fetchit "talented comic" and used this "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a comedy series of Fetchit that never saw the light of day. Naturally, the description of Fetchit is shocking to many people today, which is why the movie was put aside. <br /> <br /> Although there are fun times with both Fetchit and La Tire, "A Tough Winter" is a sinuous effort path. If the film had a positive impact, it is because the studios Hal Roach have acquired a great confidence and a great experience in the manufacture of talkies. The sound of the movie is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partly paved the way for the excellent films "Our Gang" (1930-1931). <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
