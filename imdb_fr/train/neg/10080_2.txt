I had to do a search on the actresses to find the dashboard of this movie because the title is now Unexpected love. It's not really worth looking, but I did not know the two main roles and I wondered why they were headlining a lesbian movie on Lifetime. Everything is quite small and you do not really understand who these characters are. As a spectator, I could not get emotionally involved in the script. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I do not know who is. Everything is muted, blurry and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a keen interest in seeing two women get noticed but it is treated so discreetly that I was disappointed. Hire Personal Best instead.
