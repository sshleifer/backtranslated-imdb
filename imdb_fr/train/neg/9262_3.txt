In appearance, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's good to see that the devil's child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the exorcist, when girls are possessed or devilleuses, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it stinks. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me believe she could be a devil's child, it's more like a child with problems. Questions that maybe a therapist, rather than a priest, could help. She does not look scary or evil. She looks rather sulky and sullen. <br /> <br /> This film had potential and if it had been made by the same people who had shot the previous three films, it could have worked. But it is rather insulting to follow up on one of the most popular horror trilogies, as a special film for television. <br /> <br /> At so many levels, it drops. It's cheap, the acting is hammered and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters bring no sympathy and you do not convey them. I recently watched her again after someone brought her for Christmas, and she collapsed. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of looking at this, I would suggest you do not do it. Watch one of the others, or watch the exorcist, or look at The Good Son. Just do not waste your time on this drivel!
