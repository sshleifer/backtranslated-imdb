All the ingredients of cinema cinephile worship. Bare-breasted girls (and bottomless), kung-fu chiefs, slave traders, devilish Germans with mustaches, Cameron Mitchell and zombies wielding the sword. <br /> <br /> And of course, Camille Keaton's breasts, the best-known display occurs in the classic feminist exploit I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention the mermaids of the jewel Shepard, who play the role of the hooker in the recent film The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, in a brothel, and on a boat filled with martial artists heading for a zombie island where bad martial artists are dying or something. <br /> <br /> The ups and downs come off easily and frequently as the passengers are well lubricated thanks to the owner of the boat. <br /> <br /> Then disaster strikes, his boat is destroyed and they land on the island of zombies where sacrificial monks sacrifice young girls to martial artists who died to bring them back to life. <br /> Just when you thought there was everything, there are piranhas in the water. Yum Yum A big German for dinner. <br /> <br /> The same goes for your next zombie festival.
