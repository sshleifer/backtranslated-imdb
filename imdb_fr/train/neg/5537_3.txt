What? You did not know Scooby-Doo had fought zombies? Well, you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by Victor Halperin, who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier. This would probably make it the second zombie movie made. <br /> <br /> No, do not look for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and do not even look for brains to be eaten. We are in 1936. <br /> <br /> What you will see is typical of the period - a lot of discussion. <br /> <br /> You have the chance to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but that's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!
