I do not know why this has fans like that and I do not know why I even gave him the score I have. It's absurd. There is a lot of giallo where you have to suspend disbelief, let the image roll and catch up somewhere before it becomes delusional and a poor police officer must finally explain what we have seen. But this has very little success and has very long sequences where nothing happens and that has no relevance for anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. It's not a giallo, it's a complete mix of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one of his most blatant portrayals. I think he came in, did a day's work and got out of the way, leaving Mr. D'Amato to replace the others. Ewa is of course pretty, but no, that's not enough, and in the end, we saw too much of it. all over the world, long after we have completely lost interest in this pretentious and mindless bastard. Maybe I was just not in a good mood!
