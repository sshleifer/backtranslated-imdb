An Italian-American co-production, Linda Blair and David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff: how can a fan of trash horror resist such a treat? <br /> <br /> Well, based on a scenario without history, extremely tedious, and forty minutes totally absurd, I would have said "very easily"; fortunately, however, things finally get a little more fun with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a bit of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was changed optically to remove such offensive material). <br /> <br /> The Hoff plays the role of Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) in a dilapidated hotel on an apparently deserted island to take pictures for his latest project, a book on witches; Gary, frustrated, also hopes to try to remedy a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of his virginity. <br /> <br /> Her nookie projects are, however, dashed by the unexpected arrival of real estate developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), their son Tommy (Michael Manchester) , the pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) come to inspect the island of the hotel. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are greeted by the new owners of the property. When a violent storm suddenly rises, it is dangerous to return to the continent and agree to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place also houses the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who demands human sacrifices to resurrect himself. One by one, the victims are trained in a swirling red vortex (which guarantees to provide unintentional bursts of laughter), before experiencing a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of this makes sense, and the acting is atrocious (Manchester like Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best performers, which makes says long on others), but viewers who spend the first half sad are rewarded with good moments of gore: Rose has her lips stitched together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by hooves and impaled on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and burst into geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair is possessed (again).
