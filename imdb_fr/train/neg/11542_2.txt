An uncomfortable woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly attacked by a group of psycho-dimensional thugs during a night meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and the woman who were attacked plan and carry out a revenge attack against their aggressors ... <br /> <br /> A piece of voyeuristic basket utterly repulsive, pretending to be a provocative drama thinking, "even though he seems sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been picked if it had been done so easily in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is dreadful and devastating. However, Dan Reed manages to rub his nose in the least glare of his sexual perversity. His camera lingers eagerly on Anderson's naked body during and after the assault, while the screenplay leaves almost all the characters struggling in a two-dimensional turquoise sea of ​​cliché. His scenario forces his characters to behave in such a way as to move the viewer further away from the "victims" by giving them a more horrible look (Adams' subsequent assault attempts against Sophie and Alice, Alice's attack on Heffer AFTER his confident confessional suicide ). <br /> <br /> The dilemma comes from the performances of the central protagonists - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shadow like the young man victim of the initial assault (he will end with Eastenders, mark my words) but Anderson is amazing. Even if the atrocious scenario forces her character to behave in a depraved and ridiculous way, she delivers in a way an extraordinarily convincing and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent and arrogant hedonist who faces such horrors and must retaliate. <br /> <br /> A vile and useless film then, almost but not quite saved by a convincing central female performance.
