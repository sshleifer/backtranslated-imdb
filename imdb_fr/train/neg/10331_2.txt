God, I was so bored that I was watching this pilot. I was expecting a lot because I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not only since "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits, I thought it would be a guarantee of quality, he also wrote the strange days of lead ..). But the thing failed miserably to catch my attention at one point in its duration, almost two hours. All this time, he has barely gone beyond his synopsis in two lines, and I would have a hard time trying to understand a coherent plot from all that mess that was going nowhere. On top of that, I do not think the acrobatics surpassed those of a regular episode of "A-Team". As for Alba, yes, she is beautiful, of course, but the fact that she only displays one facial expression throughout the film (sulky and surly) also makes me weary of her attitude 'attitude". You can count on me, Mr. Cameron!
