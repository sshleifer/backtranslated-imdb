Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon talks about a journalist who goes to an insane asylum to write about a new technique he uses with his patients. However, the journalist quickly discovers that things are not what they seem to be, that the asylum is managed by the patients and that the doctors are in cages. First, some parts of the movie are simply boring and make you fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for example). I must admit that the story is pretty good, but the movie itself is a bombshell. The music in the movie is really weird and looks like something we could hear in a crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene with dancing chickens, which made me want to close the screen . Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for Violence and Nudity.
