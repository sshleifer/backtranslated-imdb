It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven scenario. <br /> <br /> Although some of them are spiritual and trendy, they are largely dull, lifeless and lifeless. Most gags stay there, lacking sparkle and energy. <br /> <br /> Mae West and Rachel Welch, from the cast, are doing well. Roger Herren plays Rusty (too bad he did not make more movies). But for my money, there's too much John Huston, and poor Rex Reed has no chance to fight. His character seems relegated to chance, wondering what he does in this film. <br /> <br /> The low score of the user should give an idea of ​​the public's opinion on this piece. The original Vidal offered a lot of potential, rather wasted. Even "classic" film clips did not do much. Overall, this is a rather poor effort and it is unlikely that the situation will improve much over time.
