I like my comments to be short and simple, but that sums up the situation pretty well. You can not beat both originals for a number of reasons, including Chris Columbous's talent. <br /> <br /> This film was terribly staged by a terrible staging. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Painful to sit and watch. The story was a complete joke on a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to retrieve it. Horrible, rent one of the original trailers and have fun! <br /> <br /> The film was not even shot at Christmas like the original. Home Alone went from an excellent family comedy film to a joke without moral or conspiracy!
