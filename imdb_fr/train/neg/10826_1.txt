I can not say that it's the worst movie of all time, but only because there are still movies that I have not seen yet! It must be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although he is not as bad in this film.) It's as if you're watching a guy who tries too hard to impress beyond It's like sitting in his director's chair and thinking, "How would a great filmmaker handle this scene?" He simply does not, he does not know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker, certainly nuggets of grandeur that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to maturity.The scene in which all the characters sing was the worst moment in the history of cinema. did not stop saying, "Please, PLEASE, do not make the guy on the brink of death, too!" Of course, MASSIVE FAILURE!
