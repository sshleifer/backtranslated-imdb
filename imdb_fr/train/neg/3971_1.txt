Give me back my money! Give me back my life! Give me a little credit. This movie was worthy of being thrown up. Useless and tedious. What a waste of energy and totally useless. Okay, I understand the premise and the idea sounds but, give us a break! Next time, give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mother's remorse, blame the husband! Clich√© yes ~! Buy yourself a life! Sorry, but this movie was a total waste of time, money and being. I would rather watch the eggs cook! No real explanation of why this happened. Jail? Why? Loss? obvious but why? To play deserve what I do here Oscar and cinematography Am I doing this for a salary? How much did this movie do? Well, that idiot hired a copy. Enough said
