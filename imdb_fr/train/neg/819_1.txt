"The Domino Principle" is without a doubt one of the worst thrillers of all time. It is difficult to understand the complicated plot. Midway through, you'll want to raise your arms in frustration and shout, "I'm giving up !!!" How Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer never got involved in this mess, that's the sum of his paychecks that summarizes well. <br /> <br /> I hope they have spent their money well.
