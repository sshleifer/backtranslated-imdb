I can not believe people thought this stinky garbage was funny. By changing the attempts of humor between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is something about Mary" leaves no reason to stay until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller strives to work in the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> None of these scenes were credible. The shots were poorly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making movies at any cost. I check on IMDB what they are working on so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus comes from the time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated that too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and we are ridiculed. This movie is just stinky.
