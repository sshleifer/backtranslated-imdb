The potential extravagance of the film, which takes place in the 19th century, was unsuccessful. With renowned actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the film to fail. However, the film lacked an end, had a sorry excuse for a plot and collapsed with its continuity. The typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, reunited by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching aspect of a mother's untimely death and 'an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, who torments his daughter in life as well as in death. He thinks that his daughter's lack of beauty would ruin her fortune by marrying her social status. The actors tried in vain to recover what was left of the script. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time for those who look sadly. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, only for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
