This documentary is at its best when it simply shows the offices of Ayurvedic healers and the preparation of the treatment. One can not deny the great poverty in India and the desperation even of their richest customers. However, as an argument of Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. Although the Indian clients mentioned having seen "apneaopathic" doctors, they are not interviewed and we must take for granted the vague statements of their patients - "the doctor said there was no cure" , the doctor said it was a cancer "etc. Well," no treatment "does not mean" no treatment ", and what kind of cancer does the patient have exactly? Film is at its height when it shows the Ayurvedic practice in America, apparently it is reduced to the astonishing idea that having a very active work on Wall Street can cause you a stomach ache.
