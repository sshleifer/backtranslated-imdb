"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie Essanay's movies of 1915. Although these film groups are more watchable than their counterparts of 1914, this one seems a little below the average. The gag with the double-combination vault and the blow of the spell that makes Charlie wake up from a dream in which he strokes the lead lady's hair, then caress the head of a mop he had almost used. pillow, are the two classic moments of Chaplin. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled with fights with rival concierge concierge and robbing a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the best physical fixture in this movie and Charlie uses it for an expert comic effect, whether his character's intention is or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter-ego doing what he would like to do but not doing his own hands. Interesting things but there is better.
