I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... quite boring. For about 50 minutes, we have the outline of the plot ... In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, about 10 minutes? Then it was real action! It sounds like: "Let's go for a walk in the savannah and pant in front of the beautiful sunsets!" And maybe send a message like "Do not kill elephants!" Very ecological. I would have expected a "new" Steven Segal film, not this one ... The leading actress makes me think of artificial tanning, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I have not seen any scene where her hair is damaged, she is sweating or her clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar, where they're looking for our hero, Swayze tells the commander he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and he became famous the following years. Livingstone and other explorers traveled to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a beautiful impression .. in short - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I cuddled with a nut, but you understand the point. He really manages to have that puppy look beaten on his face over and over. The film stank. Much too long and more and more boring. do not look at him! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
