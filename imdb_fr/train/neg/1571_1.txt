Watching this movie made me think constantly; why do they make such a problem from broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed, the writers thought at least a good reason why the car was not able to stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative clich√©s make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as fleeting as a sieve, etc. This makes this film a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
