This is one of those movies that I remember being in the box for years before anything happened with it. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is rather fragile. The cast is pretty good in what they are given, but again, you're only as good as the script. Baldwin realizing that even though I would have sworn he did not run everything, I thought I was reading somewhere or that a lot of times were not bad, but he really had potential there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of genius, he should keep it busy a little longer. I just hope the show runs gracefully at the Seinfeld, but maybe not so long ago. 9 years old he passed. So, if you want to see a movie that you will not get much from, but you will not really hate, it's for you. I do not remember the last time a movie was packed before it was released and only on DVD. It was good to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins together again, because their excellent but few people saw "The Edge". Now, take this great movie for real entertainment.
