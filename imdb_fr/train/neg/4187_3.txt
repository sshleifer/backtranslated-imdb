"Greendale", a film written and directed by Neil Young, is little more than an 87-minute music video shot around one or more of the composer's works. Instead of dialogue, the film is based exclusively on the words of Young, very charged with sociopolitical comments, to tell "the story" while the actors play the scenes. from the photo, the effect is the equivalent of Young exploding some of his own films and distributing them to the public consumption. Although there is supposedly a "story" in the film, we have no idea what's going on, mainly because of the unpolished aspect of the film, the lack of dialogue and incompetence amateur acting game. For eighty-seven minutes, all we have is a group of aging hippies silently gossiping in an incoherent narrative, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. All of this becomes a tedious exercise of self-indulgence. "Greendale" gives a bad reputation to a Hollywood movie.
