If I had only one camera accidentally stuck on the ground, enough film for a single shot, then lost all this film and had to win a few dollars to buy some digital video tapes and have to make one more film of two hours on the French Revolution, which also had no decor and had to oblige my autistic son of 4 years to paint the sets, and the only actors that I could find were those which I did not make the this year's soap opera, and I was also forced to not use music throughout the movie, and the zoom function of the camera was not working, except once she accidentally zoomed in and could not stop you, oh and if I hated my audience, I could do something like this horrible waste of time worthy of hell, but wrongly hilarious. The almost grandiose sets, but completely false, reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest creations, which made it even more disappointing because throughout the film, there was that little ray of hope in the back of my mind that the film culminating in a laser battle / lightsaber duel. I do not want to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it, but that's not how it ends. The only thing I think that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review. Peace.
