the only scenes that made me laugh where those with Christopher in Walken (the crazy movie director) the rest of the movie were just boring. In the first hour or so, nothing really happens. Jokes supposed to be funny are not jokes and zeta jones douglas really exaggerates. Julia Roberts makes a routine job of the old naughty duck (yeah that's right!) at the girl next door (where have I already seen her?) who gets the guy.pourvu.je I really did not care what would happen with the main characters. If Cusack really fell off the building in a suicide attempt, the movie might have been more interesting to watch.
