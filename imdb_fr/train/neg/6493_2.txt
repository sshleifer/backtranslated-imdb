Oh my God ... as an Englishman and a little Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ... to this day, I am really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm nobody, I was hoping better. So, my comments are like "a straw in the wind". But that's the goal, is not it? - I have nothing to complain about the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the big unwashed, I will see a film that will be transported to another place. For yes, suspend your convictions for a brief period. But do not enter a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If this had been done by an unknown author and director, I suppose this "production" would have been dumped. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I was wide and confused. After reading some of the rave reviews given to this work, I'm slightly worried .... <br /> <br /> Maybe that's why I try, without prejudice, to watch each film according to its deserved. Whatever the author, the director, the studio or even the notoriety of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: do not write and direct the same production. It's dangerous. Movies must be moderated to maintain a semblance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As it says in school reports "Can and can do better ..."
