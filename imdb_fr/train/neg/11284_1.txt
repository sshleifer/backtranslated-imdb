I usually try to build reasonably well-argued movie reviews, but I can not believe it has passed the script stage. The dialogue is appalling, the game of the actors very doubtful, the accents simply horrible, and the direction and the stimulation are at the best breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the last time I saw such a bad movie. Joseph Fiennes, as handsome as he is, might have simply killed his career as quickly as he began. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau's Island was no worse than this garbage can.
