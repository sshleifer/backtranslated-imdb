Second film in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was rather average. It's a bit boring in some areas, but there are good gores effects, but they are not great. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. The vampires have conquered the world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Brigade, which also has its own spaceship and is led by Churchill, captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), rookie officer Damian and rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl of Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN will later meet Vampire Chief Muco, starring Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He does not intend to live in peace with humans because he is determined to dominate the world. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not a waste of time, I doubt that I put it back in the DVD player.
