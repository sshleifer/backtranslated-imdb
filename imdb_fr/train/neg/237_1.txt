After being very entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance in "The Panama Tailor" (which I rate 10/10 overall: casting, screenplay, screenplay, story, editing, screenplay, music, emotional impact, etc.). ), I anticipated this film with enthusiasm. I was extremely disappointed. It is a scenario that does not read a film, vulgar to be vulgar, in bankruptcy of all the ways so that "The tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen of writing and realization. I sat at the theater waiting for the "good game"; it never came. I did not laugh or cry, even though a line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Barely.
