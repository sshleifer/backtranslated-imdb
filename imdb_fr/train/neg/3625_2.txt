It's a film that belongs firmly to the 50s. It's very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this one as one of the 100 best American movies of all time. I have seen almost every film on this list, and this one is by far the most disappointing. The music numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long and boring and have absolutely no connection to the story. The end of the film has a horribly long ballet sequence, which naturally has nothing to do with the film's story. It must be admitted that it is very well done, that the music is good and that the dance is done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and inconceivable and behaves rudely. His mental age is about 14 years old. If you want to see a good musical comedy composed of the "golden age" of musicals, go see "Sing in the rain".
