Flaming stools! It's a fight between two separate brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can light fires mentally; Debra Winger is at the center of love concerns. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the genius of television behind "Moonlighting") stifles the dark comedy of Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such a slippery presentation that the film looks like an entry from an extremely enthusiastic film student thanks to a grant from fifteen million dollars. It has the thorny energy of a big commercial device, but an informal style that brings out nothing of the characters, with the exception of their disguised eccentricities. They are not even characters, they are intriguing functions. Just released in theaters, the film is a disaster, but it looks like an example of style rather than substance. Winger is the only star in a cast that seems really puzzled. * 1/2 of ****
