Now, I had the best intentions looking at this one. I like some of Tony Scott's work, but one of my friends also told me it was a good movie, even though I heard things differently. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was too much. Let me elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was too active, and not in a good way. People who have performed well are Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their on-screen time has simply not been able to save the film. <br /> <br /> Some scenes came up in their originality, but it felt like they had been written by someone other than the main writer. Some melody was used about 4 times, which really started to cause problems after the second time. I am firmly convinced that I do not use the same song more than once. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the editing really happened on this one, because the rate of cut is rather high. Oh, and the repeated echoes of some of Keira's lines seemed just ridiculous after hearing him for the second, third, fourth, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see a rhythmic action movie and "a little" funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above you might like it. . <br /> <br /> (Note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
