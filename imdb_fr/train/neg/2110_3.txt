Now, I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he's one of the most interesting characters to ever have made a movie, but he certainly did his share of nonsense. This is another example. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr.Lorenz, a doctor who obtained his medical license for unexplained reasons.He does however experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful.He revealed that she had 70- 80 years old but Lugosi seems to be in his mid-50s, we never really explain why he is married to this old woman. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these treatments or experiments involved giving the wives who are at the altar getting married a sort of odorant substance by which they faint but it is believed that Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body before going to the morgue and take him back to his laboratory where he is kept in a sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then, the stolen brides have a needle inserted somewhere. in their bodies, perhaps the neck, then the needle is sunk into the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi sticks the needle or what he gets from the wives, but it kind of restores his wife. Apparently, old age makes you scream in pain because that of Lugosi his wife cries a lot until she returns to her youngest state. Help Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie .... a weird old beast and his two deformed wires .... a son is a big he looks like a slow acting boy who likes to caress the sleepy wives and the other son is an ugly little dwarf ... a little person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three girls pile up and sleep in the lugubrious Lugosi Downstairs lab.Who are these 3 people and how they became Lugosi's scared assistants is, like many things in this film, never explained. <br /> <br /> So anyway a woman journalist is given the task by her ugly publisher to know where all the stolen brides are going. She quickly understands that the only common thing among all stolen brides is a rare orchid which is on them. She asks the question and is told that there is a world-renowned expert who has developed this orchid. This expert turns out to be scary, Dr.Lorenz. She finds him quickly and upsets his little house of horrors. I do not know where the police were during all this, but they came to clean themselves up after the dirty work journalist. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's films have always had a kind of stupid and pointless plot that made all that stinky in the sky. I mean a globally recognized expert in orchid removes brides by sending them a message up orchid he is himself known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And later, it is revealed that girls do not even need to be brides for the procedure to work, so why would Lugosi continue to kidnap very church wives? kept for his experiments and to create all the attention and headlines of the newspapers? Why not just catch a prostitute on the street like a weird pervert? This clunker made me think of another Lugosi enemy, "The Devil Bat" ... the same stupid intrigues, bad behavior and the same "silly journalist gets a nasty deal". <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he is quite scary and sinister to interest you at least enough to continue to observe him. The woman who played the reporter was just a terrible actor. She had no emotion, she had just delivered her replicas like a machine gun, vomiting them as quickly as possible. Everyone has suffered well too, when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is to watch, if only for the fans of Bela Lugosi.Lugosi is always intense even when the picture was a dog.He must have known that he was doing terrible pictures, but perhaps he also knew that if he gave all he had, a little of this intensity could shine through all the bad intrigues and bad deeds that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- we, the horror fans, will always have a love for Bela Lugosi.He gave him all his tim He was in front of the camera. We give you two congratulations, Bela.
