As an occasional auditor of the Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not really, because this film is very "of his age", in the 1960s. For me (a person born in the 1980s), it seems to me to be a purely hippie propaganda shit, but I'm sure this movie is was not designed for me, but for people active in the sixties. I was expecting a profusion of drugs with Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed the real life, the hard work in the studio, so I felt like I was working with them to come to the conclusion of this horrible film . I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suppose they follow a similar style of director, a kind of "amatuerish" that gave a feeling similar to that of the Eurotrash television series, poorly directed, poorly organized and devoid of real entertainment value. My only good opinion is that I did not waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.
