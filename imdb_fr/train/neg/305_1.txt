I'm happy to have seen this movie after Mr. Sandler's celebrity. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no conspiracy. It's like watching a terribly boring domestic movie. <br /> <br /> I really like his other movies ...... but if you're a fan like me, stay away from this one. It can change your thoughts on Adam. It is possible that you never recover from the horror of this movie .... I had a better time watching old men play scrabble in a house .......
