I will not waste my time writing an essay and wasting your time. I would like to say, however, that all those who are stuck about this film even in the making are totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play this card, and I'm talking about the patriotic map of nationalism, so that people do not watch this film. It is a film that expresses his free will in this country (oh yes, I played this card) even if the director is German and deserves a pat on the fingers every time he looks for a camera, but the world is full of controversy, and it's the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laughing and being disgusted, not disgusted together, its dark humor and obviously you do not have the heart to take it, the past is over, yes people remember those who were lost but it is time to move on, what was it !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can always watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> In addition, I'm crazy and who needs a soul?
