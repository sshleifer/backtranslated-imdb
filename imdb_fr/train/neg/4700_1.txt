I totally hated the movie. It was so delayed. They need theater lessons ... no, wait, it's not going to help because the Naked Brothers Band people are behind. You know why I'm here even though I'm a hateful Naked Brothers band? Warn people before they watch the silly movie so that the NBB does not get any money out of it and they can not create any more stupid amateur amateur songs so much delayed than any old man could write them in 10 seconds. Not only are the lyrics of the song late, but they sing poorly. Ok, I'm getting a little film here ..... anyway, it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT funny at all, even though they were really trying to do it. I guess they deserve credit for that ... well, the movie is not worth your time. Just look at his rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who even has half of the brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you have to go watch movies in which actors play, not stammer their lines. I'm in my school's drama club and some people are actually BETTER than Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than that piece of poo. I do not even know why I went through even half of the movie. I do not think it even deserves to be called a movie ...
