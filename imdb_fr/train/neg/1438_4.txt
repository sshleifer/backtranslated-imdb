Well! What can we say? First, this adaptation is much too long at 4 hours, for the complexity (or absence of such) of the plot. The actors are really trying to do something about this movie, but the content is insufficient for the time available. Swayzee is really not a character from the Quatermain group. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", Swayzee really fails to rank. This guy with the Winchester rehearsal rifle has neither the strength, the stature, the subtlety, nor the humor required for the role. the rest of the distribution. Some of the views are nice, but there are ridiculous mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrives at the waterhole in the middle of the desert, its traces are visible to the oasis, waiting for them to walk in it. Getting out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) that has nothing to do with the exit seen from the passage through which they climbed, etc. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any time. In a way, I would like him to have some. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians in search of Quatermain is a stereotyped badly built character who shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is doing pretty well as a sad father, back in London, unable to get custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that kind of thing. He is not able to assume the role of a brave gentleman with a sturdy heart, an experience of life and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
