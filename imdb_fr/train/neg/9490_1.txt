It's a complete and absolute waste, a good example of what a bad movie is. This can not please anyone, not even b-movie fans. Do not waste, I repeat, do not waste precious time of your life on this trash. Bad acting, bad staging, horrible scenario (but really horrible) and total lack of idea as to what an entertainment (whatever its form). I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like B movies, killer toys, the strange monsters of the lagoon, but that's far from the case. You know those movies that are so bad that they are funny? Not even. Simply pathetic old.
