I love horror movies that reveal a lot of mystery, like "Silent Hill" (which I found pretty good, but I was missing something) and the movies that make you guess, I thought it was one of these films. At first, the film starts with a very good suspense and is a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that, it just goes down the hill and from there it just goes down more and more quick. I first mentioned Silent Hill for a reason, because I can see here a lot of "stolen" themes from this movie. Overall, I would say that watching Silence Hill instead of this one is better, it's more scary, there's a lot more suspense and the end is much better .. And best of all, you do not will not feel scammed as I did with this one .. It just seems to be one of those "I like this movie so I'm I'll do it again in my really bad version" a little film .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a kid with a bear who has "hug me and I will love you forever" written on the belly of it ..
