Three stories and not enough links, "Inside Man" was very nervous and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Despite its good times, the film began as a fast-paced thriller that quickly turned into a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and barely regained strength in the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his role very well with a perfect understanding of his human side and not just with the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen has also been very successful with his duality share as "evil genius" and "criminal brain" (the two are not the same, retrospectively). Overall, however, each person has created a large subsection. However, when the parties finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summation of everything. All of that ended with very little of the energy with which he had started, with a lot of intrigues, tons of questions and, as I said earlier, not close to Spike Lee's normal level. I completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... it's not the film they're interpreting.
