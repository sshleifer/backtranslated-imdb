I have not read a negative professional review of this movie yet. I guess I missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an empty bar and entertain themselves with invented stories. This is the best part. After the three have separated, the film splits into three nets. That's when boredom sets in. Surely, the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls from mashed bread is at first a revealing curiosity. Unfortunately, the director beat him to death, injecting even a wild plot that leads nowhere in particular. Bottom line: a sluggish apathy of two hours. If you have insomnia, look at it in bed and have a good night's sleep.
