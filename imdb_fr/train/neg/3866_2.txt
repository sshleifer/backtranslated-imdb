I thought this movie had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you the day of your wedding for your cousin ??? I would have a broken heart !! It's classified as a comedy but I did not find it funny at all. I thought it was mostly about finding cheap laughs and taking them. I love Julie Stiles' films, but that's an exception. Jason Lee plays in another shameful show, proving once again that class and a decent morality are irrelevant in today's society. It was completely lacking in taste and I despise movies like this one. I understand that people will defend this film and its morality because it's "Just a movie", but I always hear that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you liked this movie, you're a bad person, because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and some parts of it were nice. I'm just saying that in real life, people act like the characters in this movie were doing is shameful.
