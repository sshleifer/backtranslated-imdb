I am a Christian and I say that this film had a terrible acting, unreal situations and a front completely facade for Christianity. You might as well watch "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a movie about football as a steroid steroid for the losers. Allow me to make some very pressing comments about what was bothering me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white school. I did not notice a single student or black player in the school. I deal with "white" Christian academies from the south and they were built for the sole reason of restoring segregation. It's disturbing when the film talks about Christianity and Christ transforming lives ... how about changing the heart of segregation? (Note: I loved the symbolic black coach, he was compensated by the all-white team and all the black players of the "Giants".) <br /> <br /> 2. The uncritical praise of everyone christian about this movie. Can I make some people say that it was bad to act, to film poorly, to write poorly and, in short, to be mediocre compared to other films. If we compare that to another film about football, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-cooked Christianity that was shown seemed to me even less logical than the unrealistic end. If Christianity is simply to read a little text and pray to begin a complete change of life, do not ask yourself when no one will listen to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a panacea. He does not need to sell and he does not need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles. No wonder everyone considers Christianity as anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I recognize that this film could be a source of inspiration for some people. For the most part, it will not be. This will not give a real picture of struggle and sincere tension. Most important to me, it's not Christian, far from it. It has values, but it does not stand up to a message of "pull yourself the strongest," as superficial as a positive thought. If you live alongside people in difficulty and / or living in third world living conditions, this film will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.
