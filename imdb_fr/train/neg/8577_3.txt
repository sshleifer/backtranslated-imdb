I knew that my resume would have you. How does this movie look like a Pet Rock and a Disco ?! Well, unless you went through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can not understand WHY somebody would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I still do not understand Not completely ). These are just a few elements that seemed logical at the time but really disconcert the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and her group. At the time (mainly in the 1940s), they were very popular and had enough weight for the studio to perform alongside Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you did not live at this time (it was long before my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his group mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very broad (that is, unsophisticated and old-fashioned). Frankly, I could not stand their antics and I did not understand that there were too many musical numbers in the movie. Because of these factors, mass retail has been relegated to the background and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film features Kyser and the group in a house where a young woman and her delusional aunt live. Once there, the bridge is destroyed and strange events begin. Eventually, this leads to some attempts on Sally's life and a session (somehow). Everything is played to laugh - and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's at best a fair entertainment. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I really felt cheated about watching Kyser and his head shots.
