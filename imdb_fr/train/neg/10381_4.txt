The haunted terrified thriller discovers an American family settling in a 200-year-old house in Japan where a murderous love triangle / suicide has occurred. <br /> <br /> The novel setting is pretty much the only element of interest in this very slow and very moving horror film from the director of Motel Hell. The film does not generate suspense and consists of jerky scenes that rarely seem to lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male leader goes to a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had warned. The monk tells the story of the house (that the viewer already knows of the opening sequence), then the film is simply reduced to something else. A little earlier, the monk had offered his help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as the situation continues to worsen and the monk is never mentioned until the end, when he shows up again to do what he should have done. an hour earlier - try to chase the spirits. out of the house, although at this point, it is difficult for viewers to care. <br /> <br /> There are some laughter campers (probably) involuntarily seeing the American actors in the end become possessed by Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, probably because the scene reminds a little the chain-mate duel of the same director, Hell, which must have been more fun, but overall, it's an unforgettable rat.
