... but an ugly film. As Maltin said, it was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... TOO serious! The plot is stupid and slow (something about the elderly living in the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the movie is all about talking talking talking talking talking talking talking over and over again about the same things. I fell asleep several times! The movie is so dull! The actors sank through this, with the sole exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it was probably a work of love for both of them (they often complained of horror movies too violent ... well, it does NOT have violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... it will make you sleepy!
