Inspector Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a major problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the extraordinary psychic Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him to capture, was resurrected with The First Power (.. that Satan gave him after his execution in the gas chamber) and can possess weak bodies. One way or another, Russell, who joins Tess (who understands what they're up against), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of The First Power, but was denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing. a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing rid the world of his evil. She will take it anyway and give a hand to Russell, who will need all the help possible if he is kidnapped by Channing, who prepares for a kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Mykelti Williamson, always a trusted actor, gets the role of Russell's partner .. so you know what's going to happen to him. As in movies of this type, everyone around Russell dies, but when he tries to kill Channing, he is only murdering the accursed host of another poor soul he owns. <br /> <br /> Pure waste occult ... stupid from the door to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a movie like this, they have no chance. Kober, who is usually still effective as a heavyweight, is really nothing more than an awkward scoundrel who jumps in the air and throws rotten jokes.
