The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90s. The second was just as funny with the same cast and the same jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious to know how they could go on with the same story, knowing that Kevin would have been 17 in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes an equally annoying child and makes him sick. The child is 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone at home? What kind of burgerlers team are these idiots? I do not want to go into too much detail if you want to see this film with sadness. But please, I recommend you stay away. It's not worth your precious time. Bend a piece of paper, do housework, put a pencil on your nose or take a nap! Better then to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
