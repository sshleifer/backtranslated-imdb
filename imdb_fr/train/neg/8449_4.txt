what an absurd story, blackmail to murder, sexual allegations about children, gays and the Catholic Church .... How is it that most television series, seated comedians, and so on? UK-based must include the obligatory gay, it's getting really tiring now. Everyone admits there are gays in society, there are just other minority groups, but we do not want that to crush our throats (I'll pass this one) to every show. Apart from the above, the drama went from a story that could have been an interesting little story to a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays running everywhere, oh yes to be totally PC, a homosexual couples were black. I am surprised that ecclestone even considered this when he read the script.
