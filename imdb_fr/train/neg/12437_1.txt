'Home Alone 3' is the first Home Alone movie not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie 'Home Alone'. Instead of two comical villains, we have three or four. This film has traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote control car. Humor burlesque is also constant, but the boy and the bad guys really fail to make an impact in this movie. (No pun intended) This movie offers nothing new or different from the previous films, and there really is not the warm atmosphere, the vacation or intrigue that the other two movies had. It's more pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh because the characters did not really do it for me. I would not recommend this movie. it's pretty boring. If you're looking for a good family vacation movie with comedy, watch the original movie "Home Alone".
