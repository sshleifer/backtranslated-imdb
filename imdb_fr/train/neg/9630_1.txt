I realize that several of Ben Stiller's films are or will be released this year, but he should perhaps insist on quality, not on quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by what the filmmakers thought would have happened for comedy in "Polly Came Along." <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is squeaky, unattractive and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick becomes tiring. He has no doubt a comic talent, but he must either find another boy or take a break, find really fun material. Because his films go from painfully without humor to terribly bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good actress with a promising career. As long as she continues to make more films like "The Good Girl" (in which she is great) and less like "Along Came Polly", she will have a career she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston desperately tries to defeat the soft material she works with, but it's hard work for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as Reuben's chief Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, Reuben's best friend, Sandy, this horrible film is not funny. Other characters, such as Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid, he's terribly funny. <br /> <br /> The principle of "Along Cam Polly" was certainly promising. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could turn it into a good comedy, instead of that lame, boring and boring excuse.
