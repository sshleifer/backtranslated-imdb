Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago to broaden his horizons and get into the horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is a piece of abominable scrap. Now, if I had noticed his name in association with this film in particular, I would have found it but no, I did not have my glasses and so I missed them, damn it, I really need to take them with me while shopping video. The first question would be who is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" children's movie, but again, there are topless babies and some gore and a few big words gushing here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farming tools of some sort. Looks like a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a murderous witch who has recovered the teeth of the kids lived there. Probably something that the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, nowadays, there is a little girl ghost to warn the real little girl who is now living that something bad is going to happen. Yes, and there are also two Bubbas who were squatting on this property when the new owner took over, so they want revenge too. All this gives the impression of a cable junk made for children on Halloween, except, of course, things that are not suitable for children, so not only is this mediocre, it's confusing. A big boo and a whistle at Anchor Bay for having published that too, given their usual record with nice outings, it's a new low. The United Kingdom receives a box Phantasm Box, we get "The Tooth Fairy". Sounds barely fair. 1 out of 10, the absolute garbage.
