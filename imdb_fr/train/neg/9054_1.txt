If you hate the accents of redneck, you will hate this movie. And to make matters worse, you see Patrick Swayze, one who has tried to be a redneck. I really can not stand the accents of redneck. I love Billy Bob Thornton, he was good in Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie get? The scenario was stupid. I usually do not make that film judgment, but I could not stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, check out Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... numbers ... I think I'll finish it and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may just be that I do not usually support redneck accents or that I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not there. I did not laugh once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid. If they had shown fingers breaking, I might have laughed. Having my fingers crushed by accident always makes me laugh.
