Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) prepares to donate his problematic shrink / expand machine to the Smithsonian Institution, while his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) and he prepare for a long weekend without their son Adam (Bug Hall). Gordon (Stuart Pankin), Wayne's brother, his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children, Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson), volunteer to care for Adam while his parents are away , but title luck would lead you to wait), adults are accidentally zapped by Wayne's shrink radius. As children run wild, their miniaturized kids have to deal with monstrous gigantic insects, carpet ripples that look like canyons and other threats. It was bad, as are most video suites, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of laughable. I had to laugh at this movie "cockroach" Stuart Pankin and the party brutes were even more ridiculous, seen at his peril!
