It was supposed to be a parody of the LOTR trilogy. But it was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad scenario, all bad. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I have no doubt that there will be people who will love this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies of films by renowned directors like Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I work in a movie theater and DVD Shop and the success of this film was similar in both areas: in the cinema, it was a great success (but not at all big) during the first two weeks but then, when the critics among those who saw it were not very good, the film fell very quickly. In DVD sales, it was good for a short time but no one asked for more. In the last ten years, the two worst films I have seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which was the worst, but I'm glad there are so many good movies, so I do not have to think too much about this.
