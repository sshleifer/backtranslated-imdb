The only thing that has prevented this film from being a total disaster, are some interesting elegant touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Comic Book Death drifts a bit off the scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which delivers death by comic book. This was still well managed, especially by observing ink bleeding and degraded colors. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a demon bike. <br /> <br /> That said. I'm glad I had the cheap DVD in an end-of-sale store, because it was pretty awful. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films were also annoying that you constantly realized that you were watching a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to redeem it, or to make sense of it, it contains at least some stylish notes, mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD allows you to go to the 8 "nightmares" where something is really happening, that's the only way to watch that. The creation of scripts between the moments gores of the creation is rather unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
