- The movie starts with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unbeknownst to the local population, a dinosaur egg is also found at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg hatches by releasing a dinosaur that terrorizes the community. <br /> <br /> - What a trash. It's not that I take care of the clay dinosaur stop-motion, it's all the rest of the film that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comic. The logic is non-existent. Any similarity between the "scientists" of this film and a real scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on forever about the bad aspects of this film, but you see the idea. I think it's safe enough to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
