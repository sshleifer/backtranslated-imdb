That's the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I do not like his style anymore. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities for whom to create documentaries, then make fun of everything that concerns them with an ironic retouch. It's never really a direct caricature and Morris seems to say most of the time: "No, no, these people are really fascinating, really!", But there are always those slightly sloping angles and this not so subtle editing techniques which show that Morris seems to make fun of him behind his back. <br /> <br /> This film traces the journey of four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies the hairless African molesters to realize how surprisingly like an ant, a tamer of lion, a man who keeps a garden full of shrubs in the shape of animals and a designer of robots. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what refers to the animal, human and life characteristics. So, the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does not really seem to mean anything in terms of film ... right? Except that, of course, Morris seems a little disturbed by the passions of these individuals (he could call them "obsessions") who design synthetic drawings on life. I do not share this fear and, honestly, do not appreciate some of the links established by Morris in the film. <br /> <br /> But I insist on its subtlety. In the absence of voice over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it is not as if Morris was putting this anxiety on the collective head of the audience. Instead, he mixes circus images and ant images, often when removed from the context of the circus and ants, showing a kind of collective nonsense behind what all these people are talking about. I do not find them absurd, I find them all very well and interesting. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he does not want such juxtapositions, which means he's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter. Since none of the films I've seen so far has particularly impressed me, I do not really care what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
