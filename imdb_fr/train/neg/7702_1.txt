I am a black man living in a predominantly black city. That being said, Tyler Perry's work raises serious concerns. I realize that some people feel the need to praise him because he is black and tries to give a positive image of the culture. But I honestly believe that if Perry White had this film, he would have had the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson on his ass. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this movie all hell. of many recently and every repeated viewing boils my blood. The characters are poorly written and misinterpreted. The jokes are so bad that I must know that something is supposed to be funny. I'm just going to break that big pile of sh-t. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have had some appeal, but this is no longer the case. When she never seems to have hurt children and threatened adults with violence, she is simply useless. It is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The situation of the wife who beat her fiance was horsesh-t. If a woman was so frightened by her husband, why would she try to run away while sleeping in her bed? Would not it have been more logical for her to leave when he was at work? In any case, the characters in this arc were so boring and domineering that I hoped he would throw her out of the balcony and that he was completely upset when he would not do it. A bus driver asks a woman to harass her while touring. I could not believe it. I really could not believe it when she agreed to go out with him even more. But what takes the cake is that an adult man has been reduced to throwing pebbles to a window and passing notes like a ten-year-old boy from a mega-castrating bitch. I do not use this term lightly, but this woman had only two modes. Morose victim and psycho mother. It does not matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was a constant. The bus driver was not going to get any. He even married her without tasting the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene of the family reunion. Here we have the mother load that includes implicit taboos implicit, a grind to please, b-ball shirtless and too muscular, as well as the good taste of Maya Angelou. When these babies dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was it wrong to wish the oldest of them to have a heart attack? All this shit happens at the meeting, in groups ridiculously easy to separate, then they ring a bell. When they do, everyone leaves his job and embarks on a stern conversation, like a pack of Pavlov's dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. It shows the abusive fianc√© being mistreated by his long-time victim and bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where blacks are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to look at it so far, in addition to testing your pain threshold, is the hope that the second villain in this story will also let it go. Guess what, it does not happen. Instead, Perry chooses the path of testicular challenge and puts it safe, ending the film in a forgiving tone - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure if I was given a day, I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all aspects of what this film is afraid of. Do not even get me started with the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'm just going to say this. In my opinion, as Black, D.W. Griffith's legacy is still alive. The irony is that he does it through a black man who will be commended for doing what Birth of a Nation did by selling us along the river. I only wish Perry movies are guys so I can kick them in the ass. Thank you very much, man !! What will you follow in 2009, a comedy about rape and the brutal slavery of slaves in colonial America?
