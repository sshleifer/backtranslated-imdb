When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant virus chasing some nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey," I knew I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this movie of cheese balls, which always does a good job, whatever the role he's playing ... I still do not know why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because he has nothing to do with this monkey. But go people, what were you waiting for ?? It's not really as bad as it sounds ... If you like black-and-white bugs of the 50's style, this one is essentially an updated version, without them special FX updates.
