Ivan Reitman is a kind of savior. The most tired intrigues (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his expert hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that are worth it. So I was disappointed to see Reitman unable to take a rather original plot (the man drops the superhero, the superhero takes revenge fueled by the superpower), and turns it into something nice. "Girlfriend" is a useless exercise. The one-pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it should be a romantic comedy or a drama of superheroes. The result is a film of flip-flops between the two, neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is on top, as usual, and Luke Wilson also finishes his role, although his sluggish antics get tired quickly. What's even more exasperating is that in some scenes (like when a very excited Uma hits a headboard through a wall), you feel a cunning and cunning Reitman's opus that practically shouts out. But a few seconds later, the magic is lost, disappeared as fast as the super-heroine whose films disappoint in almost every way.
