Another film based on the clich√© banal and worn mad scientist gone crazy. The film is centered on a surgeon who aims to bring back the dead ... to life. I know, I know ... you never heard that before! Of course, while all these movies go, the experience goes very badly and creates a manic and bloodthirsty creature. For this promising configuration, one would think that it would be at least a little suspensive. False. Like many movies from this era, the idea is beautiful, but the execution and the script are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the jewels, either.
