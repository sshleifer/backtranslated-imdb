First there is the Gujarati Theater, then Bollywood. Both have their strengths and their followers. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theater when producing a Bollywood production. He first made Aankhen (adapted from a play in Gujarati) - which had a unique plot, but could not stand for a Hindi film. Now he has adapted another piece of Gujarati and named it Waqt - a race against the clock. In summary, emotions are foreign. The development of the plot is not for Hindi movies. For example, it is preferable that the role play between father and son be entrusted to Gujarati theater - do not bring this in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is better left for the Gujarati scene. All performances are average - no complaints - except Shefali Chhaya Shah, who is fantastic.
