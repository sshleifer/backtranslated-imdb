Think of this movie as a live action program on Saturday morning from a long time ago. Even small tires will find it difficult to satisfy because it behaves like molasses! I do not really understand how awful it is to create something too typical and interesting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior-wizard movies have used the same old plot many times, but it's quite rare given its appeal to little darlings. And who in the world would have let a topless mermaid be thrown? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another gem for your 1999 TV season!
