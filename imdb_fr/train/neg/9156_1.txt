Ben and Arthur COULD BE ONE 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director and leave the game to someone who could act. This is a good example of a person controlling all production. There was no one to tell him, "Sam, it's bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> The actor role of Jamie Brett Gabel was the only positive point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors with whom to work. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be strapped to a chair and forced to watch this movie (twice). the acting and the staging were so bad that this film was turned into a comedy. it was enough to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second positive point .... it would make an excellent appointment movie. after the first two minutes, you stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
