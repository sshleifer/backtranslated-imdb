This movie was bad. Bad acting, bad staging, bad writing. But it was not bad in a funny way. It was bad in a boring way. I looked at "Surface to Air" because I thought it would be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I made. There are a lot of nicer ways to spend an hour and a half, like watching the paint dry or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
