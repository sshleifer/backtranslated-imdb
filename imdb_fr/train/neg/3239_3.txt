Ah, the famous series "Guinea Pig" ... honestly, I must say that I was totally disappointed by this series ("He Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Manhole" and "Flower of Flesh and The Blood" being exceptions ... and even these are certainly not great ...), but "The Devil's Experience" comes down to nothing. There is nothing realistic here, except the eyeball piercing scene (or perhaps anti-climatic, according to your perception). The victim does not seem to really care about what is going on and moans or moans while being subjected to "hideous" tortures (most of the time sometimes "hilarious"). "Flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and bloody representation of fake "snuff", but this film also falls flat on realism. I congratulate the Japanese for pushing the limits, and they have come a long way in the past two decades to bring the crown to the making of "extreme" films, but "Devil's Experiment" just does not fit. Worth a look if you're a tough guy, if only to see what's going on, but I can only give this movie an incredibly generous 3/10, and this only for punches. scene...
