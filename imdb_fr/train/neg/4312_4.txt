It acts like a satire in the era of the women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to see. It goes in the same direction as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically a standard tariff fluff. What I mean for this movie is uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who is absent from normal work by forming a group of winning fools is a waste of time. It's the same feeling you can feel after watching this. A nice attempt to turn the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I was expecting better things.
