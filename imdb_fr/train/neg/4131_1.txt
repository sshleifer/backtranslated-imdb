This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this film is a total waste of time. Calling it "Campy" does not even cut it. "Campy" implies a fun that this movie was not. You spend the first half of the movie thinking, "It has to get better, no?" In all fairness, he does it at the end, when he finally explains who the "brother / sister" team was and what they wanted, but at that moment you are not, because you Have you spent the entire second half of the movie asking yourself exactly what did Mr. Onorati and Ms. Pacula do to check someone else THIS for being stuck in such a horrible movie? <br /> <br />
