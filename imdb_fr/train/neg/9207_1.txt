This movie was sold for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD so I do not feel like I lost anything watching this movie, except for TIME. Enjoyed Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling) acting, who looked very young and performed exceptionally well, considering it was a horrible scenario. The story is about students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and his parents advise him to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice girl and has a romantic adventure with her. As soon as he starts playing, he stops making love to him and behaves like a monk. Some scenes of the film revolve around the former World Trade Center, as well as in the observation area and roof. It is rather sad to see this part of the film where so many human beings have died because of the evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except for Tom Hanks who tries to keep the movie above the falling level of entertainment.
