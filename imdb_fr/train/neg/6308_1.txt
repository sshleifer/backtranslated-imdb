All the merit of the content of this film, as a British, I did not know that there was a segregation in the US Navy during the Second World War. A very courageous attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction is nonexistent, the acting is wood and the scenario is a cliche after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and curled up from beginning to end because of the very bad way it had been put in place. It could have been a good movie, the story for many of us outside the United States was new, unique and interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it was put in place. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, was wasted in a poorly shot, low-budget film. I only hope that in the future, one of the main studios will take this theme and do it justice.
