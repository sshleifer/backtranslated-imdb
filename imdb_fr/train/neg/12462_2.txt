I saw this movie last night after many positive reviews. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try to constantly determine who is who and what is all this means, you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I still can not understand the role of the actors. in this film, the film is different stories and does not allow you to really feel one of these roles. <br /> <br /> For political buffs and people interested in corruption in other governments around the world, this film is probably good, but for the average viewer, this movie is awkward, very boring in places and you leave the cinema confused and annoyed to see that you have paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> see it if you are ready to concentrate. 100% on every detail or policy you are interested in. do not see it, if you really like watching movies.
