This is one of those dramas that is so bad that it seems almost very funny, the scenario is absolutely terrible, a terrible direction, a purely induced lighting, the only thing that abandons it so badly that it's good, it's is that the sound design is only bad enough; it does not bring suspense to the story, even if it makes efforts, but does not destroy at least the speeches. There are problems of continuity of the seasons of door knocking throughout. And finally, last but not least, the acting is awful. For a professional production, it looks a lot like a university media project, you must be sorry for the one who should have put their names on the same subject.
