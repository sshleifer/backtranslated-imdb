Cynthia Rothrock (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this movie enjoyable and of course, this pretty little girl burned the screen with her artistic abilities and sexy body. China O'Brien gets angry as a police officer and decides to quit, return home to her hometown and find her roots and her father, who is the Sheriff of the locality. Her father grew old and the city changed, gangsters took control of the city and began to convince local women to take charge and city dwellers were fed up with their city going away. Well, you can almost guess what's going on, and you're right, China O'Brien is defending himself after a tragic tragedy. Wrong interpretation, but Cynthia Rothrock completes this film in a wonderful conclusion.
