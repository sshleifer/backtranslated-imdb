He surprisingly had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less intrigue (I do not want to talk about Asian movies but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere was not too bad. There is no real reason for most things people do and how they react to what is happening. Although I think of a lot of movies, in this case it was horrible, of course. <br /> <br /> It has so ripped some movies as for unique scenes. The acting was bad but I saw worse. The movie was bad but I saw worse. Watching this movie is an experience of boredom, laughter, the desire for death, sadism, excitement and entertainment at a low level. <br /> <br /> So if you like bloody movies with stupid intrigues, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it can be fun if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in a good mood.
