did tim meadows play his first role in a movie? the character, Leon, is quite funny, but soon after, the sexual jokes and the humor are too stupid to be listened to. Some movies can afford sexual jokes and get their audiences to know as soon as advertising starts. Some movies that do this are an American pie and a horror movie. Horror movie was stupid, and American Pie would not have done well without the sexual jokes. The only role after Leon, who had a little humor, was Will Ferrell. the character was really silly and that was all, silly humor was all that had looked at me. the movie was ok, and nothing else. I do not really understand why snl people who are dying to leave the show are still getting a movie based on a character they played in the series. the sketches last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie from a 5-minute sketch, then what is the world about? Molly Shannon had the superstar, Cheri O'Ritri had a horror movie, but she was not a leading role, and will have Elf. but it was good, but he made a silly movie, but I do not remember it, and Mike Myers with Wayne's world. how come the mad television team never got film offers? saw only one guy break through, but only in like 2 movies and a TV show with Andy Dick. but this guy relies on comedy for his life to go on, funny or not. this film is not good, but had a positive humor. what a waste of film and money people.
