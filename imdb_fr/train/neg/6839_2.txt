The twin brothers separated at birth (because of the death of their parents) meet twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and recover their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact lasts two hours and brings no real approach to the Corsican brothers' plot and Jean-Claude Van Damme is enough, because the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother. In addition, the action sequences are not as exciting this time and Jean-Claude relies more on gunshots than on his martial arts. In addition, the support cast is lost and at two o'clock the film is simply dull. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
