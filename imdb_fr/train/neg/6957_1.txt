Avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but poorly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a capital sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This film tries to combine the western epic, the plot of the drug and the epic of the costume of old regime. What? Well, consider this. Cowboy music is hilarious in sword fights. Or what about the woman in underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do a 'What's new Tiger Lily' on this bomb. Rewrite the script, then duplicate or subtitle it. Heck, it's almost that now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, known to the American public, have roles.)
