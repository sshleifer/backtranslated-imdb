You were kidding it was AWFUL !!! <br /> <br /> But despite that, I was given this movie and 3 others and they were all on DVD. The film starts pretty much like a movie OK, but it goes down pretty much in the middle. <br /> <br /> And the end as well, let's just say it was one of the most anti-climatic endings of recent film history. A lot of gore in the final sequence and if you like a dose of horror schlock, then this is the film you need .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
