What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him in the rat race and watch him squirm? Homeless people do not respond to anyone. They have no mortgage, rent payment or idiot boss. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS, performance evaluations or credit card payments. But, give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about getting into the race, buying gas for transportation, paying for their car insurance and work for someone else. They are fortunate to be "productive citizens". This film was as exploitative as a movie could be. It is a way for the rich and bourgeois of the bourgeoisie to say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and that proves capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a film that asks, "What happens when you remove everything a rich man has?"
