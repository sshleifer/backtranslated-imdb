In his film "Blow Up" of 1966, Antonioni asked his hero the question of the truth in front of a group of young British protesters. By opposing such questions to a web of hippie youth movements, Antonioni has questioned, intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true can actually be a lie? On the other hand, the film says that we have to fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others might deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects are the most difficult parts of "Blow Up", they created a beautiful texture and gave the movie more meaning than it would otherwise have been. It was a very cautious and mature little movie. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni throws all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes full hippie. The result is a film filled with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy stories. How can someone who, during his career, has shown such restraint and intelligence make something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a series of close-ups, as we watch a group of radicals discuss the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly, a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. He recognizes that, although revolutionaries struggle for freedom, to bind themselves to such a militant cause is to give up one's freedom effectively. And so, like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger", Mark only wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He does not receive orders from anyone. When the police raid his university campus, Mark shoots a guy and runs away. He then flees to a nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and flies to the desert. Antonioni regards the desert as a peaceful utopia and the contrast with ruthlessly capitalist cities, with their billboards and their modern hollow apparatus. He sees the desert as a sort of garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love. Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Freed from the constraints of modern life, these tree-goers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by rubbing themselves in the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Mark dying and Daria dreaming of exploding his majestic homes. homes of wealthy capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Pick up guns, pickets and explosives, he says. Shoot the walls before you lock yourself in! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film had no effect on his audience. They recognized that "Zabriskie Point" was just another radical self-centered commercial attempt to be radical. A kind of mercantile radicalism. He felt fake and tamed. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you're not happy with the modern world and big cats that exploit you, you have to either flee into the desert (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). It's fine. But although artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares, they are usually unable to show us how to effectively manage change. As the end of the "Fight Club", nihilism and violence come to nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be brought about by modest inventors, stimulated by minor technological advances. I mean, what women released more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a calm and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to gain more adoration of the counter-culture that embraced his previous film, "Blow Up". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" appears as a very pretentious and stupid film. It's essentially a 50-year-old man who says, "Look at me, I'm a bold rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films in which the public is encouraged to fight "the system", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the life of the freedom fighters leads to failure, even if in each case the "spirit of revolution" survives. The message is that you can not make a change, but in dying or failing, the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom. We must essentially continue to fail rather than lose hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", which just make you explode. Destroy everything. Explode everything. Everything is a lie, so you can also shoot flaming guns. These films are born of feelings of anger and reaction, rather than any kind of common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "Fly rather than fight". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films like "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show people fleeing worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful refuges. The two directors are pessimistic, in the sense that Malick sees his islands destroyed and Antonioni his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films such as Donnersmarck's "The Life of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state, it is the unbridled creativity and free will of the artist / criminal that keeps the system in check. By simply standing outside the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions, and critical eyes challenge the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film presents novelists and artists who undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex, the artist / criminal who fights against the Nazi droogs, painting the city with blood and sperm.
