Unlike many, I do not find that the premise or theme of this show is shocking in the least. His execution, however, is another matter. Like so many B-less movies, all the decent gags seem to have been merged into the trailers. For most of the 22 minutes or so, we look forward to a bit of humor. Or at least something that prevents you from moving with the remote control or counting the carpet fibers. With a few exceptions, the acting is awful; the comic over-print and gesticulation of some cast members may be appropriate for a late-night infomercial, but not a sitcom at prime time (even Canadian). CBC misplaced the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they had the tone - and the script - completely wrong for the Prairies. The last insult is that they apparently could not even afford to get the locator work done in a real small town (why are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the public would be fooled by the exterior of downtown Regina? As a proud Canadian, I hope that this will soon disappear and that the rest of the world, prepared by the CBC / Radio-Canada publicists, will soon forget the colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
