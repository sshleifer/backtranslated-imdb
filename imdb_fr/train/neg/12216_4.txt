Do not get me wrong, I like David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series and the movies but I already have enough of it: Death On The Nile. Everyone did this one! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used this incredible talent in another novel by Agatha Christie. I will say that the game of all actors was superb. The sets were great and very realistic. I particularly liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how "dreadful" he was. I hope he does not have that appearance in the "real" life! Honestly, I do not remember other movies if the end was the same. In a way, I do not think so. I thought it was a brilliant touch that Ms. Christie wrote it or not that way. I would much prefer that this end be spoiled in prison!
