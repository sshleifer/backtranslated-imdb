When someone enters a movie of this type of film, it is not without saying that an overdose of this wonderful over-the-counter cerebral drug, Suspension of Incroyance, is extremely useful. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman that Nelson Eddy has ignored since the dawn of time, but who is also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction to seeing this was a silent breath. from "Hunh?" Where have I seen this before? In fact, I've seen it before, but in a film made much later than this one. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgettable pile made in 1987, took advantage of the ethereal beauty of Emmanuelle Beart, who could not speak, wore a blonde wig and made life difficult for soap actor Michael Knight. . Much worse from every angle imaginable with ultra-low values ​​of the 80s but probably an updated version of this turkey from 1942. Anyway, this film is not memorable, it is not about of a memorable film, but it is informative because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, who were neither very good actors nor extraordinary singers, played together the role of "innocence" and the "clean" romance for which they were known. After that, you may need a cold shower, not because there are very hot scenes, but to get rid of the memory.
