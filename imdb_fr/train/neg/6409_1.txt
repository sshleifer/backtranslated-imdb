I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who award the title to a star must be buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know shit when I see it. At all levels, this movie is terrible. Technically, most of the time, you do not know where you are in this movie, even in a scene, it jumps POV like crazy, without reason. No logic whatsoever in cinematic terms. Emotionally, it's dark for self-love and tries to be a psychological thriller when it's confusing. Throwing ugly red collars into your movie is an inexpensive way to convey an "atmosphere". I had lost patience a lot of time before the last act, but I was having too much fun with my friends who were doing MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, two films have been successful, even if the inscription of "Scooby Doo" on your CV could count. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) can not possibly find him a vehicle. And Mr. Shepard, if you're having trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to appear in a movie like this! (In addition, Patsy Cline's estate should sue for defamation!)
