You know that when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you his story, you sit with a pathetic smile while all you want to do is slap that fool and leave? Well, I had a similar feeling watching this movie. Okay, I actually chose to go see Aprile and I knew the taste of Nanni Moretti to be the one and only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last article of his memoirs, I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least two other characters managed to get a word in the edges. However, at Aprile, Moretti has exclusive rights over dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a sharp groan on the best way to do his politics, or on what weird element of the Popular culture fascinates him right now. He also finds time to get rid of movies he does not like, which in my opinion was reserved for losers like me. Surely in a position like his, one might think that he would try to talk about cinema a little smarter than that. By making an appropriate film, with ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps with a disgruntled voice. And when he began to love his newborn, I just wanted to go with someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed filmmaker with a strange fondness for old-fashioned music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you his story, give him a slap. Each stroke will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.
