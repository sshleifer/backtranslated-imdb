This film was a blow to me. I suppose that little girls should aspire to be only models in swimsuits, housewives or mistresses, as this seems to be all that they will ever be described. It's really sad to see an artist's work and his life so badly interpreted. Incredibly (or perhaps we should have expected), the entire character of Artemisia and all that she defends has been reduced to a typical Hollywood female character; a pitiful little creature, physically impotent and impeccable, with none of the character traits that have earned her that place in the history that has been mutilated here. Even sadder was to see that a large part of the public was too poorly educated in the field to understand the incredible gap that separates the message conveyed in the film of reality. Describing the artist as a lover of her true rapist, a person she has actually accused of having raped her even under torture, makes me downright nasty. If the director had nothing more substantial to say, she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.
