The acting is bad, ALL the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they have a lower than average IQ. I realize that the film was meant for children, just like Malcom in the center, but they still add humor and adult situations. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from a show conducted by Bob Saget, the only comedian who exists less who is less funny than a balloon hitting the groin of a man, which is probably the why he stopped organizing the funniest videos of America. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your children watch this show unless you want to save money in college. Expose your children to stupidity and they will grow more numerous.
