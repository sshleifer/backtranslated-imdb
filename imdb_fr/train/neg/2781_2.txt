It is a film that tries to retrace the history of Thailand in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it was part of the lineage of many Thai films that I watched and enjoyed, a film in which Thai actors speak Thai and the madness of Martial Arts. Well, that's not it. This film is shot entirely in English, full of Anglo-Saxon actors and has production values ​​so terrible that it is ridiculously bad ... but not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? The acting, the dialogue and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some scenes of combat seemed to have been choreographed by the local high school theater club. The special effects were also generally bad, but some were just cheap animations, put on the screen and producing a particularly cheesy effect. There is a big epic-style outdoor fighting scene, where a few thousand extras run in costume on a pitch in costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat - HA! What joke! The film features some beauties. What a pity they did not show a little more skin. At least, it was something that the guys had to enjoy. Do not bother yourself.
