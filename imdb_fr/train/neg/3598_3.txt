Do you know when you look at your collection of old movies recorded on video and you realize that there are that you have seen only once or twice and you can not remember if they worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is / was one of those films; I found it, not so long ago, and I decided to give it a chance. I'm not quite sure that I'm satisfied with my decision ... On the one hand, the film is really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape ... yeah, you understand. The plot is predictable and by no means original. The rhythm is bad. The acting is bad, but it's not really surprising, since the two main actors are former soap opera stars ... they are used to reacting too much. The characters are badly written clichés. The film even manages to screw up the simplest way to impress me (through the film): court scenes. Even those do not arouse emotion for or against thin characters. The film has no redeeming quality ... even the dialogue is bad. The problem is that it's so full of clichés that it's laughable. And that's the only thing that raises above a 1/10 note: the comic relief (even unintentionally) of the many cliches and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the film, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One last word: I considered using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as a summary, but everyone knows, so I opted for the current version because it is more informative. All in all, it's a really bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for some laughs, if you can sit through. 3/10
