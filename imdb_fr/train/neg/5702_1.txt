What a desappointment! I hated mom but it was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at one point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can not believe that people really liked this movie. Nicholas Cage's role was not very convincing. The whole movie looked like a great tour around America's most wanted buildings. The never-ending stream of allusions and combinations was not very convincing either. I stopped paying attention about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a good night became a total disappointment. What a drag ... I guess I just watched too many movies to take advantage of National Treasure.
