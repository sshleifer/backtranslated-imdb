Normally, I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so painful that I have to. I cracked in front of the frightening and predictable plot, the lame acting and I laughed at times supposed to be tense. Indeed, the majority of the audience seemed to be bored and chatting even at the "most tense" moment of the film. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only representation of merit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" in the end was not. I heard that the movie was not taken seriously. but I found little evidence of this in the film. <br /> <br /> Cut should have been left on the floor of the editing room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
