OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, has never been, and will never be a funny man until our posterior heads south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a fun man, no doubt because of the talented screenwriters and directors and all the other talented teamwork characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest sitcoms and without date never ever produced by America. How anyone who might have the audacity to even try to reproduce the character of Phil Silvers is beyond me. To complicate matters, the exercise was repeated during Martin's unambitious attempt to be Inspector Peter Seller Clouseau, another unsuccessful attempt, in my opinion, to revive a seemingly unpleasant career. Some of your contributors say "Steve Martin puts his stamp on the character", I would even say "balderdash", his representations will be forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be precious for generations to come
