An interesting idea for a movie, showing both the last dragon on earth and the fight he's waging with someone diabolical. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed to the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half of his heart. Now grown Einon (David Thewlis) is now the egoistic and diabolic king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend, Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for the "slaughter" of dragons. But since Einon hears half of Draco, they both feel that the pain is hurt or killed. Pete Postlethwaite in the role of Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs in Lord Felton, Julie Christie in Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud in King Arthur. He has been nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. It's worth watching!
