This film failed to explore the humanity of animals, which left me feeling empty inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forgo the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) resisted the trend of big budgets by focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their human counterparts, all the animals in this movie were nothing more than comic caricatures that the we could happily stuff in the meat. grinder (even more so if one could understand their useless babble). Without Eddie Murphy's wacky behavior, this movie would be a flop.
