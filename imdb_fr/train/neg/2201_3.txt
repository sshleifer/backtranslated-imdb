Horror / science fiction it's interesting because it's laughable. F / X rather good ... for what you manage to see. A thriller made for television that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but misguided scientist who distorts stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrible results give birth to a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a distant island to discover this new and brilliant experience. Of course, after laughing and stammering ... The creation of Coombs, also his own son merged with a hammerhead, is left to hunt colleagues, one after the other, his father. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
