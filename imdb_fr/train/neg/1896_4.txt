This film shows us nothing original. Every idea or scene (action) can be found in many movies already released. Fabulous Nick is completely clear here. Even Will Patton is calm and devilish, nor good. Mr. Duvall is fine, but has a very small part. So, Angelina, how can we determine her celebrity? Overall, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing are particularly detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. Too bad, do not you think?
