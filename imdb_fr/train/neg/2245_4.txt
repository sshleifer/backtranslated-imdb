This film is NOT identical to the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, which is a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I do not deny the talent of Barbra Streisand at all. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I do not know Kris Kristofferson's other work, so I can not judge that. However, this film leaves a lot to be desired. The pace is slow, nudity is free and the language is foul, and it can be very difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris and judge for yourself.
