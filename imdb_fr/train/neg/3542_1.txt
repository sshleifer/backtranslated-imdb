After reading the comments on the site, I feel obliged to write for the first time. It seems like this movie is like Marmite and divided the audience. I must say that, although I agree that movies do not need meaning to be nice (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they should always interest you in the characters. Now, while I was completely engrossed in the murderous lesbian affair of Lynch's opus, I must say I could not make fun of Mr. Green or the other cardboard gangsters who lived in this Dayglo world. <br /> <br /> Also, while many people seem to be trying to say that you did not like it because you did not have it, I should not disagree - I do not have appreciated because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to these quotes repeatedly did not help. Call it clever if you want - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing is to ask a question to all other commentators - there was no end credits on the print of the movie I saw. Just music on the black. Have I looked at a failed impression or is it proof of GR's claim? Or, did everyone involved in the film watch the brutal editing and get their name removed ???
