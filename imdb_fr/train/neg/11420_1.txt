St. Elmo's Fire has no influence on life after college (for most of us, ordinary people anyway). Why was this trash made? Who can really understand that? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry for the actors who have to deal with such a terrible scenario. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been just a joke for them on the set. <br /> <br /> I actually found this "film" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I get from this is to hope that Sir John Hughes had a good old laugh when he saw a showing of that the same year, his Breakfast Club masterpiece was published. <br /> <br /> Do not make The same mistake I made to look at this because you like movies from the 80s. It's really shocking for the genre.
