I saw most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager on "Cliffhanger Theater," which aired after midnight on a local channel a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater was held at the beginning of 90's. Time has not been soft with that. <br /> <br /> I can certainly consider the special effects, which were quite impressive for a low-budget 1950s soap opera (IMO's Commando Cody's flight scenes were better than those of George Reeves / Superman in his television show). And I can also showcase the "game", and fight the choreography -. except for the guy who plays the Moon Men ruler. He is incredibly misunderstood. He looks and acts like the guy who comes to fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the nerdy dialogue works well - everyone tears their lines like strings of firecrackers, without wasting time or breaks for things like "thinking" or "introspection". Since everyone does it, the viewer finds it immersive after a while, and even for my modern sensibility, it does not bother much. <br /> <br /> What really irritates me is writing and conspiracy. I'm not talking about the sunny moon, bicarbonate propelled rockets, or a flight combination with "up / down" and "fast / slow" commands. I am not even bothered by the disdain of the cliffhangers' resolutions that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are more stupid than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And by the fact that although the dialogue unfolds like an express train, the plot repeats the same movements over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig it up: Commando Cody and his friend are the spearhead of a highly secretive scientific laboratory charged with protecting the Earth (or at least the United States) from extraterrestrial invasion insidious. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys come in right and beat Cody shit and his staff ... not once (maybe understandably) but MANY times. They even kidnapped his assistant on the second try. And they never become more intelligent. To prove my thesis, let me point out how Cody dresses in tracksuits and flies into trouble, and never seems to be able to catch anyone. He does it again and again and again. Cody also sends her ship to the moon (the assistant comes to cook), stays about 30 seconds and immediately turns around. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray guns ... and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he could not be bothered to lock it. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to saving the United States from the Moon Men, he could ask some soldiers with rifles, a few helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of working all the time with the local police. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they act as if it were another episode of Gangbusters. <br /> <br /> It's hard to bear. I appreciate that creators have been severely constrained in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually quite a tough guy (even if he loses half of his hand fights). But I can not help but shout "DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when the gangsters simply enter his lab, or try to blow up the ship and there is NO security measure at the landing site in place ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> But it's okay. Among the three series of the Republic I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better plot, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but that's a good waste of time. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why men "Radar"? They did not use radar, they used atomic guns. Should not the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
