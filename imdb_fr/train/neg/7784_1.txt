This is a wonderfully self-taught example of a self-taught, self-produced, written and realized project ... while I was working as a crew member, John Carradine commented (before the burn sequence on the stake): "C ' is the worst * t I've ever worked on ... and worked on a lot of sh * t pieces. "An interesting moment earlier, when Jim Mitchum was having trouble with his lines and had started swearing in the Santuario courtyard (a religious sanctuary in Chimay√≥) - at that time, one of the local spectators "vato loco" growled "... show some respect man", which apparently led Jim to remember where he was because he then made a very deep and sincere apology for his inappropriate behavior. Anyway, the crew did the work with adjournment and was never fully paid - but it left with a lot of particularly weird stories - like the night we surprised the 10-year-old son of the producer / director entertaining himself by building miniature traps for tiger breaking our legs in. As they say, "You must love Biz ..."
