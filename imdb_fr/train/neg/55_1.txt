There are only two movies that I would give a 1/10, this one and "The man who fell on Earth". I remember seeing Protocol at the theater in the early 80s while I was in high school. The script insults the intelligence of anyone (including a high school student). He completely lost me with the gag "hillarious" of someone being shot in the buttocks. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but appears as tasteless and stupid. Then come the offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie who wins everyone by launching a populist dribble. The game was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not bear to see another movie in which she was until IMO redeemed herself in Everyone says I love you. This is the kind of movie you do if you do not want to make any effort to write a screenplay. The worst.
