It's 1982, two years after the Iranian embassy, ​​which included the spectacular SAS Rescue from the Balconys, and a war with Argentina about the Falkland Islands, what better movie than a movie "SAS" of Gung-Ho - cracks the Iranian siege of hostages, using the British hero of the number one action of the day, Lewis Collins. Add Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and you have a winner on your hands? ... well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the acting is quite second-rate. it's like a long film episode of "The Professionals", but without the formula. This film is not going anywhere and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to part with Lewis Collins as James Moore's replacement for James Moore. Look at it if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS things in general, otherwise, save your time.
