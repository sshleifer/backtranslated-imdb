I had high expectations after "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less well) "East is East". The history of British Asians who fit into their adopted country has had a lot of success on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness Gracious Me, etc.). It falls flat. Despite a good start, he quickly went down. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a horribly typical BBC effort, with strong regional accents, overflowing and annoying characters, a "Those Who Are Today" soundtrack and many of "questions" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself cracking several times during this film. The writing is predictable. All possible clichés were dragged and broadcast. In fact, I find it hard to think of intercultural / intergenerational devices that could have been used and were not. The characters were meager and clichés: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well-meaning but ultimately racist old woman; overweight, domineering aunt; invading Indian parents; the working neighbor; the deep grandmother "wise"; the motorbike thug. The scenario was weak, with every chance of shocking the public with a racist dialogue declared by the two racist white characters taken on a dimension. And why it had to be settled in the 70s (apart from needing an excuse for the soundtrack of the 70s) is a mystery. It may make incredible characters a little more believable to people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even these things aside, a good acting game could have led this into a respectable darkness. Instead, the usual suspects of the "BBC comedy" have been indicted. "Bend it like Beckham" had a better acting comic act (and a serious game actually) than this one, with a virtually unknown cast. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, a sluggish, finished scenario in a dull scenario. predictable story. Leave it alone. <br /> <br />
