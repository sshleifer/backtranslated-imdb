I was one of those "rare Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was an excellent series for the time and would have made an excellent action / adventure movie if only the writers could figure out where to target it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting it to be crazy, but I did it. do not expect to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, it could have been both beautiful and exciting. He should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... rescue people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan, who saved the situation instead of his younger brothers anyway compared to the original). Lady Penelope and Parker were the guests. The characters in the original did not matter to me, but I was grateful to them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I always liked the Thunderbirds more for high tech than for the reports, and even that did not take enough time on the screen in my case. I would have liked to see more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But, I'm just a big child ...;)
