"Succubus", the edited version of "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden", is a tough fight, even after 76 minutes of inactivity; more than this horribly boring and pretentious trip to European horror and I may have gone into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco delivers again a really awful piece of waste from the 60s that seems to have been done by a team The team is not afraid of class A hallucinogens, because not a second of this mess did not make sense. Apparently, it's one of the best of its 180+ movies? It is hard to believe that there is worse. <br /> <br /> This unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes about sex, violence and lesbianism and introduces some S & M for good measure, yet he still manages to stay numb, boring, boring. <br /> <br /> Can I leave him a long time before entering the dubious world of Euro Horror ?? life is too short to look at it like that.
