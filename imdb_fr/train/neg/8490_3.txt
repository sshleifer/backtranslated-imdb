It was a nice attempt, but it's too pretentious and boring to go beyond the trap of its budget. The use of virtual sets works almost, but at times, it fails miserably. They used the budget well, I guess. I just wish history and most actors are better. There are many parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would be nice if they achieved those goals, but they did not do it. Disconcerting and incredible story. Bad DVD transfer too. It does not take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. I had to stop that. It was too boring. I can make slow movies. But just make them attractive in some aspects. Visually, in terms of history, acting, etc. This was missing in all departments, so it never corresponded to a captivating experience. Maybe the next attempt of the filmmaker will be better.
