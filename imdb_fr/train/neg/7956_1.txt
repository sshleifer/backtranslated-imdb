This film should be the number one on the last 100. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched it, we almost got physically sick. And the story is worse. I could go on and on about the gravity of the situation, but all I wanted to do was add a warning to Frankburn's criticism, because I see that no one else has bothered to do it for the moment. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thank God we saw it on TV so we did not spend it. If we had been obliged, I would have been obliged to write to those responsible for this abomination and to launch an execration in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always loved watching Carrie Fisher act. But I am sad to say that it is not worth watching in this particular movie. Do not lose your opinion on Carrie by viewing it.
