My comments can be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you care enough .... <br /> <br /> Save Grace should have been titled "A paper excuse for the old Britons to get on the screen." This film is silent. Casual music is an annoyance, as are the evocative, unusual tunes, which appear sporadically to comment on the story ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I understand!). It's basically a Cheech and Chong movie made believable. by her heavy English frame and the overwhelming power of Brenda Blethyn to impose emotions on an audience using her own voice. I could literally hear people from High Times magazine get their nonsense in front of the huge "heads" that litter this picture. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to peddle her illicit goods in the streets of London in a bright white suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The score of 7.2 is the result of the exaggerated vote of fanatics. Do not waste your time ...
