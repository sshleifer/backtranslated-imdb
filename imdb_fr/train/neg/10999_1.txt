Imagine the worst sketches of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute film. Now imagine that all the humor of these bad sketches is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Have you understood? <br /> <br /> Ok, check out The Underground Comedy Movie. This vision you just had will seem to be the funniest thing ever. UCM is the worst movie I have ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very little. But it was bad. Even though the intention of the movie was to be lame, he was too lame to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry at wasting my time watching this is someone else I know has bought it. He wasted his money. Vince Offer has neither written nor directed anything and it is not surprising why.
