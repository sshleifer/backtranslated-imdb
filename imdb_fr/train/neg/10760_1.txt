This "film" is the culmination of all that is wrong with modern cinema. Useless idling, useless reversals / jumps / jumps, useless characters, unnecessary dialogues ... essentially unnecessary. (Is that a word? Well, it's just been invented by me, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to the practicality? (ie the car garage, the skin spray), the only tool that combines a futuristic and realistic function is the card sweep at the cafe. <br /> <br /> What happened to respect for women? (That is, the blacksmith character only degrades most of the film, but always "wants" it.) IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, good looks and no admiration or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective who detects? Smith did nothing but sit and feel sorry for himself, complain to other people, and when they said something that aroused a thought, he was leaving. it's a bad way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... it was good once, but not many times in a row. (speaking several times in a row, what was the "I snore and do not listen to a joke?" Twice in a scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to small parts of a movie that make sense and not just a tool to promote the rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith. ...... Of course, we should be concerned about him and whether he should hurt him or not, <br /> <br /> let's forget that there are people, women and children to be attacked everywhere by robots and selfishly save the only person who did not know me and why he had to get his bike in the air, arguing, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> do not get me wrong, i'm all for the show but i'm also for a dash of reality soul and meaning. <br /> <br /> I must say that I have never laughed so hard in a movie i n long time. so thanks Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray that the social clock will come back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and all that is simple in the movies ...... but especially to simpler techniques . <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Movies: "So You Must Die"
