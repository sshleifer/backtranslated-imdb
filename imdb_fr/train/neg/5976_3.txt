The rumor is true: girls love COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey Girl travels to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration of not being lucky, some girls are celebrating around $ 300 each they earned last night. She's auditioned at the bar where they work and is surprised! The place is completely filled with "two-year-olds" bursting at the sight of girls dancing. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (the part "coordinator of fashion" was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the start. Violet and her father looked way too ridiculous as they chatted all the way through the movie. And check that Violet is too stuck on this keyboard with the break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time, how could I think of such a terrible production? For a short while with this movie, Hollywood could stand up and show a new stock without any major public outcry without saying, "You've been warned!" Instead, it seems that COYOTE UGLY has the firm intention of trying to embrace all the major backs of the world. Baby advertising in a bar, but telling a paper story "keep your dream going" has disappointed all the male teens you've targeted! <br /> <br /> And finally, the music. I did not find any music breaks in this movie, especially when it was necessary (hospital scene). Each scene looked like a short musical video that you just wanted to stop until you opened the bar. But the highlight was an ultimate sneer: a song of the '80s genre that Cyndi Lauper would expect to jump on stage and play with Violet. Heck, I personally thought that Bon Jovi was going to jump with long hair and jam too! <br /> <br /> Other than some really smart camera work with coyote girls during the dance (especially the wet stage), and some cute shots, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed. Whether you were watching or watching the movie, it was like nothing more than killing time. Or lose depending on how you look at it.
