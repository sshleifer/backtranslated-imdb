If only to avoid making this type of movie in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but does not tell any convincing story. <br /> <br /> It can be virtuous to sit down there because it addresses a lot of important points, but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer does not escape with new perspectives (unless one comes with someone leaving his mind wandering, as he will invariably during this useless movie). <br /> <br /> It would be better to spend your time looking out the window. a tree that grows. <br /> <br />
