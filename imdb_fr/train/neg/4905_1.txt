I am generally disappointed by the movies on the network. Even movies that attract renowned actors are usually ruined by viewers. However, this one is the worst of the worst. The scenario is weak and the acting, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I walked hard to see the plays at my school for children and was treated to play better. Pollan acts as if she's reading the script as she speaks. When she tries to express her fear, anger or sorrow, it's extremely hollow. Because of the overall quality of the production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to brave this one, be prepared for a big disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel hot and confused and you'll probably be as anxious as I should see the end come. "First to die" says a lot about this film.
