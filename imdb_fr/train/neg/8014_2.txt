"Wild tigers that I knew." It will only be in big cities, of course. It's one of those films so artistic that it makes no sense, except for the director! I hate those! And all these so alternative / artistic people are desperately trying to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT Horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, no story, no morals, no timeline and nothing fun. or even touching. For me, it was a bunch of assembled scenes that had nothing to do with each other and were all meant to "show" to show how much they could be "artistic" and "visual". It was an attempt at at least one other teenage anxiety film, but she missed the target at all levels humanly. Then the credits roll! I was waiting for it to make SENSE! I was waiting for "the good part". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could probably be called "art house movies". It will not be among them. You will be very sorry to have paid to see this movie, let alone to have bought it on DVD.
