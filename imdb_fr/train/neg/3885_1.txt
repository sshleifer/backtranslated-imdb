This movie was not only bad - it was terrible. After looking at it, I really felt the need to take a shower to get rid of the dirt. There is a common 'gag' with an elderly couple having fun, it's not funny, but it's disgusting. The monster makeup was cool, but that's it. Continuity errors alone will make you angry - at least I was. The editing is really mediocre. <br /> <br /> Almost anything you can do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends likes "bad movies", this one is exceptional because of its incapacity, I could not even make up for laughing at it. You were warned.
