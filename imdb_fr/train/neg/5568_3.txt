Dolph Lundgren plays the role of a former policeman / boxer who seeks in the evil scene of Boston the murder of his brother, well known to the community. However, he discovers on the way that his brother loves sex perverts and a serial killer must blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good at this movie. In fact, based on his performance here, one would forget that Lundgren became famous through action roles. That said, the material does not help Lundgren. In fact, Lundgren is completely left to dry in a monotonous thriller both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good. In fact, the film works best when it is centered on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett. Indeed, if the film had taken the time to explore their relationship, the film would have been rather correct. However, the film is dull, the action is non-existent, the plot is not sufficiently explored (B. too boring around Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily bloody and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is really very good (like newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film only moves from one sequence to another, which makes it particularly disappointing. If anything else, it shows how underrated Lundgren is as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Out Of 4- (Poor)
