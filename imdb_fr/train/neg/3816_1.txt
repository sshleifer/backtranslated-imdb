He played very badly. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it on. TURN IT. Or you linger for the next 30 minutes. This should never have been broadcast. It's not great You should never see it. NEVER NEVER So now, if you want to watch this show, do not do it. Turn to the CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, these shows are much better for families. So believe me, I've already watched that. and honestly, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of television. So please me, and never watch this show.
