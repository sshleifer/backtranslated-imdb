The opening sequence must show that the Legion arrived in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops disembarked from the train - dressed in the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, went to war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war movie you are going to see will be a turkey. (The French army saw as early as 1915 that the war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats did not work.The French metropolitan troops were placed in the "blue horizon" and the colonial troops in the khaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp?) redo at least the more or less correct uniforms. It is a shame that administrators make these kinds of mistakes by trying to do something else.
