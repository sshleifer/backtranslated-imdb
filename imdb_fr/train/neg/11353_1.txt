Today, I visited an Athenian cinema with my two children (aged 6 and 8), paid 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US dollars in total), not forgetting gas, popcorn and sodas . the theater and was "forced" to watch what could have been a great 3D movie masterpiece but turned out to be a "cold war like" propaganda film, like none I've seen at over the past 20 years ... BE A FILM FOR CHILDREN ... IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The Greek working average does not earn more than 850 euros per month (about 1050 US $) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My children liked ... but they have not been more than babies> in Greek: mora, morons> like the one who wrote the script and the others who made this "shame 3d" happen. <br /> <br /> The PS 3 3D animation is fantastic ....!
