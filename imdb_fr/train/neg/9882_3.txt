There are exactly 2 good things to say about "Fantasies" (both have also been mentioned by another reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) The extraordinary beauty of Bo Derek, a source of poetic inspiration . She has blows in this movie where she even gives a run to Catherine Zeta-Jones for her money, and it's really a compliment. His nudity is brief and discreet, but it's enough to look at his face. <br /> <br /> b) The scenery of the Greek island, with its sun and crystal blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and sometimes involuntarily funny ("It touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a gooey fool. Bo exaggerates the naivety of his character, but once again when it is necessary to work with such a bad dialogue, it is unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she continues to pronounce the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is an irritant major). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently, everyone, from children to the elderly, speaks English all the time. (*)
