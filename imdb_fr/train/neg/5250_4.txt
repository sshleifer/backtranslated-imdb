I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein. So I was very excited to hear that a movie based on this book was being created. <br /> <br /> But the film terribly disappointed me when I saw it because it did not capture what I liked in the book - Erica, absolutely ridiculous, and his interesting way to see the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I realized that it's not what I imagined in the book. So, I just went for the ride. It was not so bad, I suppose. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I had imagined! I did not think she would be a person who smokes and drinks - Jean Kittson, who plays it, is hilarious! work, but alas, I'm so fond of the book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I could not help but feel disappointed = P
