Another comment called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he saw the same movie as me. "High Art" had to have the most depressing interiors since "Seven". Sheedy and Mitchell can almost be forgiven for the clich√© of going to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before you do that, you have to look at the opium nights that are inhabited by people who are apparently not gainfully employed, but who somehow support a thriving addiction. Not to mention the icy looks of these familiar movie types, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, who know they'll be upset over the next 100 minutes or so. The film also indicates that Sheedy's character has been retiring from professional photography for ten years now. What did she do, retired at twenty?
