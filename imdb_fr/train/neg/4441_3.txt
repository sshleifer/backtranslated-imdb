"Triumph of Love" is the proof that all the authors of the Comédie-Française using a disguised nuptial parade as Shakespeare are not worth the detour. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something has been lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a playwright inspired by Commedia Dell Arte which Brittannica says: "His nuanced feeling and his intelligent wordplay are now known as marivaudage. " <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino has fun throwing three novels in the air, her role in the pants is not even up to Cherubino in "The Marriage of Figaro". <br /> <br /> The editing of Herky-Jerk is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of shots were needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as a cute girl, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the audience we are seeing and the closing curtain that reminds all this is an artifice does not really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/29/2002)
