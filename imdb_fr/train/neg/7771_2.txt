It's a strange film, where you get the impression that the bond company had to intervene, and I'm not surprised that there is no credit, who would like to be associated with this film. The game of all the actors involved is terribly overheated and the plot jumps everywhere, it really makes no sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to enter because it seems that there were a lot of footage that had not been shot and that all the music was very bad for the library (cheap , I suppose). Very very strange. Maybe I could buy a DVD, if it allowed me to know what was happening and what happened to this movie.
