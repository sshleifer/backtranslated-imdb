This long lost film is sometimes available on the Web. So I bought a copy. Of course, the acting is terrible and the scenario is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who have searched this one also know the backstory. It was manufactured by a Grindhouse movie owner for an extremely low budget. But for me, he certainly did not waste money on accessories, but on makeup. Makeup is for this kind of film well done. The zombies are observable and the blood is intact. The only problem with this kind of movies is the quality of the film. It's terrible, thankfully, no hissing sound, but sometimes it's way too dark. So, you have to look clearly to see the gore. In a funny way, they tried to sell this one as really not for dummies. A voiceover indicates at the beginning of the film that you have to watch a sign and that a man appears with green flashes that tells you there is blood on the way. Of course, that does not work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, had that annoying bell when the red thing started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls had been made a year earlier. Do not go for the story, go for the zombies and notice a continuity error. When the girl and the guy make love first, she takes off her bra, then they make love and suddenly, her underwear is back in place ... try to do it, or is it I'm a little disconnected, ... eat it, corpses
