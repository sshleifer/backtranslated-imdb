I thought I saw this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews and they did not match at all. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I'm still convinced that this is the movie I saw, despite the differences in the reviews. Therefore, I put my criticism: If you like the film "B" occasional as I do, then the movie "Return to Boggy Creek" is for you! Whether it's setting the stop timer, knocking yourself out in front of your favorite movie bomb, or spending time with your friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you have a fun night of improvisation. Warning! Is the legend true? I think we could just find out, with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be equipment malfunctions at particularly important moments of the film? Does our young hero, young and virile, have hair on his chest? Technicolor, a cutting-edge technology, will it last the duration of the film? You will have to look to find out for yourself.
