This movie was horrible to say the least. I was hoping much better after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was a real scam of "The Simple Life", except that it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> The realization was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she was not so terrible. By cons, Alyson Michalka has been bad all along. Chris Gallinger, who played love with Amanda played the role of a Frenchman, but had a terrible accent. A very good thing about this movie was the adorable Michael Trevino, who played the role of Alyson's love. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been broadcast before "High School Musical", it probably would not have looked so bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give him a 2.
