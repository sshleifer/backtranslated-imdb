For the small minority seen here who praises this film, GET SERIOUS. I know it depends on the personal opinion of people at the end of the day, but anyone with more than two brain cells can surely see that it's hogwash. Too bad, that does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how great it is are friends with someone who is involved in the film and trying to give a boost to their career. Poor in all respects, do not convince people by saying otherwise Storyline is a summary of the previous entries, just like the script. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not hide the lack of ideas of filmmakers, and there is unfortunately a total absence of fear. Absolutely no redeeming quality, total shit. I attributed a mark to this pair of chanceller simply for having the opportunity to find someone to finance this shit. They had to make more effort than they did to make the film. Shame.
