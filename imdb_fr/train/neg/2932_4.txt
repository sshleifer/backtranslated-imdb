Not that it bothers him, but I'm not a friend of Simon Pegg. If I were, there is a good chance that we would fail if he continued to make such slags. The problem is that he found a formula that succeeds like the idiot dude guy in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but it starts to run out. Here, his character has no perceptible qualities, he is rude and heinous, and thinks he is funny when he does not. When he was transferred from London to New York (and I suppose this link is meant to attract viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he also turns out to be out of touch with his new colleagues. However, it is not surprising that in the middle of his pretty jutes, he hires a disguise stripper to participate in an editorial meeting, an act of revenge against his boss. Still, Kirsten Dunst is starting to warm up, even though he has not done anything nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, he falls in love with Megan Fox at first sight, perhaps because his character is as superficial as his. All of this leads to a predictable movie ending, although I can not see any viewers express how it reflected their lives. The shame is that on paper, this is a casting that is worth watching. Pegg, however, plays herself, Kirsten Dunst seems to be just taking action, creating no chemistry on screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. The only big advantage is Miriam Margolyes, Pegg's hostess in New York - now if she had spent more time on the screen ...
