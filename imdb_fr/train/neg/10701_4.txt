In London, joyous follies organize a treasure hunt. A young woman inadvertently prepares her married father to a married politician with a strong, independent woman who has never been in love. Intriguing vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, played by an aviator like Amelia Earhart, too involved to indulge any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the feminine point of view, but why are all the old clich√©s preserved like frozen artifacts? ? Billie Burke plays the kind of crying and crying woman who goes to bed when things go wrong, and the Hepburn final scene is another disappointment. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate's watchers. ** from ****
