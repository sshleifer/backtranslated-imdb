If I had the chance to write, direct, and play in my own movie, I would probably choose something about robotic women with guns. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make probably the strangest movie ever seen. "Slipstream" is a movie so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say, "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> It's a film where, in a scene, a man crosses the road in the direction of a yellow car on the right which suddenly changes into a pink car on the left. It's a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing on the walls. It's a movie where a man starts talking about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" only so that the actor of that particular movie suddenly appears as himself (and then disappears into the air). <br /> <br /> It's a film that decides to get out of the window the need for a coherent plot and to use fifteen different montages at the same time, as well as to go from black and white to color without apparent reason. at all. <br /> <br /> I must, however, congratulate Mr Hopkins on the choice of his actors in this film (some of which feature several characters). Everyone involved jumps into their roles, although they probably have no idea what they are really doing. My favorite here was Christian Slater's thug in the hat who was impressive threatening while babbling nonsense and singing the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins is reported to have made this movie as a joke and this is perhaps the best way to summarize "Slipstream". It's a joke on the public. You will look at it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come, but only to discover that the answer never does. What's the slogan of this joke, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a big fan of this director. I imagine Anthony Hopkins shares my love for Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as one of Lynch's movies, though he imitates many of his techniques (though I was surprised to find out that no one is talking upside down in "Slipstream "). It's way too chaotic and random - as another reviewer has pointed out, it's the filmed version of Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that a small number of them are able to look at this and derive something from it. Unfortunately for us, "Slipstream" is quickly becoming a disturbing and confusing experience that has only been realized through the participation of Hopkins. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
