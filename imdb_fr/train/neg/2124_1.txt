This film is about the story of Eddy mentioned in the title and his return to the country of old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends as he discovers that Eddy has left to deal with the death of a friend whom he feels responsible. But this is of no consequence because the choices made in production are extremely poor and are not fully realized. Scenarios do not always have to be talkative, but they should at least help the development of the story. Here, attempts such as "he just took off" or "I know you do not have love in your heart" simply conjure up something worth the public's time. Moreover, each time the writer does not really know where to go next, he goes on to a musical montage of the protagonist walking across fields to indie music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the type that gives quality and substance to style, then this is not the movie for you.
