Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First of all, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele stars in all of them. I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT IS A LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy without the raped girl. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is acceptable for television on popcorn, but he was not credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) The movie was supposed to talk about the rise of a young man at military power - not the slave ship captain who is waving with the English girl looking for her dad ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie, I should call the police - because it would be a crime!
