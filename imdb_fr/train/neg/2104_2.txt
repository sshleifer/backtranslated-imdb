I bought this video at Walmart's 1 $ bin. I think I paid too much !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi produced a long series of third-category films for small studios (in this case Monogram - those who directed most of the Bowry Boys films). Although the misery of most of these films does not approach the level of misery reached by his latest films ("classic" Ed Wood, such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space), they are nevertheless poor movies and should be avoided by everyone. but the most ardent fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie fanatic, so I tried it. In addition, some of these lower-quality films were actually pretty good - but not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his wife rather bizarre and violent alive with a serum he concocts brides. They never really explained WHY it had to be wives or why it was women or even the illness of his wife - so you can see that the plot was never really destroyed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a very boring reporter (like Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of things for all those apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! It follows signs until the threshold of Lugosi. Lugosi's home is complete with his crazy wife, an assistant and two strange people who are apparently the wizard's sons (an ugly and hunchbacked sexual demon and a dwarf). Naturally, this brave journalist fainted throughout the film. Apparently, narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Finally, all the maniacs die - mostly because of their own hands and everything is fine. In the end, the journalist and a doctor she just met decide to get married. And, of course, the journalist's silent cameraman faints when it happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was such a slow and heavy film that they fell asleep!
