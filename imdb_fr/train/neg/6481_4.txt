As the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious to know her sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (One) is a high-quality classic animated feature film, a grand music score, and targets a general audience. The Petite Mermaid 2, on the other hand, is primarily aimed at young children because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's self-image, the music is more vibrant and less dramatic, and the end feels like a break. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when baby Melody is introduced alongside Ariel's family. Suddenly, without any visual sign to help the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Ok, I'm going to stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity remove any potential drama to the extent that it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout this feature, Melody seems superhuman, what I defend is how most children conceive. This quality in Melody's character is clearly highlighted towards the end when she fights Morgana without fear of her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of problems with Ariel, except the other way around. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father by limiting her to the ocean, while King Triton limited Ariel to the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against their parent. <br /> <br /> The music is more moving at first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but not as much orchestral work went into it. It's good for little kids, because you do not need an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and uplifting. The rest ends with an inflatable song and everyone plays in the water. This is definitely more for children, because instead of the end is solemn and leaves you blown away, this ending lets you think: "It's time for recreation!" In the end, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have fun.
