If this movie had been worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This insane disorder makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen this pile steamed, but I remember I wanted to make serious personal injury to everyone involved. How anyone can give this movie more than one star surprises me with the kindness of everyone who has seen this tripe. I give it a star because there is not a lower note. All copies of this film must be burned on the ground, sown with salt and reserved for the most toxic discharges. No, a copy must be kept under ultra-high security and presented only to the filmmakers as an example.
