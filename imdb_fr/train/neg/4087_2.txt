I usually talk a little about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie, there really is not much to say. Just a mishmash of other FAR epics of better sword and witchcraft. The lack of cohesion reigns, just like banality. Even the main villain refusing to wear clothes other than a loincloth is quite boring, because she has almost the chest of a young boy. Slightly amusing in his unfitness at best and severely backward in his worst circumstances. Lucio Fulci was tearing the bottom of the drum and it shows. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: galleries Posters and photos; Lucio Fulci Bio; and theatrical trailers in the United States and around the world <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani does not have topless (some may think it's attractive, not me); various extras are topless too
