There are many problems with this image, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a cartoonist who escapes into a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately tracked by a local that seems rather disturbed (Craig Sheffer) and seems to attempt a third-rate imitation, Mickey Rourke. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman supposed to be there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience to find out who the really good guy is? Logic disappears after the first ten minutes and never comes back, and there are more questions unanswered than it should be. If you think that "Blue Desert" could be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
