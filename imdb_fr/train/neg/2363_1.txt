This film was just awful, the first movie was not so great that I mean, it's ridiculously stupid if they did not have enough with the first 5 movies, you had to add another, why not not to make a series like James Bond, I'm going to tell you exactly why, because bond movies are actually very, very good and those films smell bad, I do not understand, was that supposed to be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for the sake of good The niece would not be afraid of such a ridiculous horror attempt, of a gun at the head of people who at least want to be afraid at one time given in a film called horror. Please no more of these movies.
