There are people who want to know everything! This is the only explanation I can give about the existence of the film House of the Dead. And this is just a scary part of the whole movie. It's such a shame that you stop forever at the movies. I seriously wanted to turn off this feature and turn on the TV on the Paint Drying chain, but my word had forced me to bear it all. I do not know why I'm doing these bad things. <br /> <br /> As if that mattered, here is the basic story of "history". A twenty-three-year-old group is so desperate to go to an island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada in fact, because it's cheap) for the "Rave of the Century" (consisting of about 8 people and some crazy music) they pay some old $ 1,000 steep fishermen to take them there after they have missed the main ferry. It must be a rave to be worth all this dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Isle of the Dead (I thought it was the house of the dead?) And that they were all condemned to yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> First mistakes here. Why a little rave (of the century, my foot!) Would it be held on an isolated island? Why would someone willingly pay big sums to get it? Why pay even more to the old steep fisherman to bring him back when he could come back with the others? <br /> <br /> Once arrived, they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been broken, there is blood everywhere and nobody is here. What would a rational person do? Course for their life of course. But no, these blind people, obviously blind, decide to go and get them. Soon, they discover an old dilapidated house 50 times bigger inside than outside. Another half-hour of stumbling into the forest follows as a pretext for killing some of the less important characters. After a hard time, they come home. The characters, like the movie, do not come anywhere. <br /> <br /> The immense disaster is plunged into a plethora of chaotic dialogues, hateful acts, chaotic exhibitions and zillions of clips from the famous arcade game of the same name. Why this has been universally accepted as a good idea with filmmakers, I'll never know. Clips do not refer to any scene and only further degrade that recycle bin, if that's possible. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with the game, except for a cheap and disposable line at the end. This gives Resident Evil an air of cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems worthy of several Oscars compared to this junk. The only one who stands out with his dignity intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have taken his money and run, but he does his best with the horrible scenario and brings a little bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast is afraid, I'm afraid. The characters are fools and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you remove useless and swearing nudity, I see no reason why this film can not be broadcast on Saturday morning on television. It's not scary at all. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the wicked villains of this movie. Where do all these bad guys come from? There were only a few people on the island to start. I guess that justifies the reason why they chose to reuse footage again and again. I'm not kidding, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately responsible for this scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the film is nonexistent. You can clearly see that the actors have no idea what they should do and that the zombies do not really take it seriously. The actors seem to read memory cards as they stop constantly in the middle of long sentences and continue to speak as soon as they see the next card. All this seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is shot as a mini-series in two parts. I have actually seen better TV productions. And do not start me in the editing. The film is incoherent babbling with thousands of useless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put to use. It is really disconcerting to see how such unfathomable films can be made and that George A. Romero can not even convince anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes a foolish allusion to Romero in a lazy attempt to be "postmodern," but it only irritates to think that CELA is in the same category as REAL zombie movies. <br /> <br /> For what? It's worth it, the anamorphic image of 1.85: 1 looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is crisp but unimpressive and only serves to make the heavily overdriven ADR even more pronounced. The DVD comes with extras but why you torture yourself. Is this opinion not enough? Stay away! You are all doomed, I tell you! Condemned! Sentenced !!!
