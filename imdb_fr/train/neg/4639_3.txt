Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a very bad movie. The premise was really good but the overall performance was really terrible. I would have liked filmmakers to take their time with this project instead of launching it quickly into production. A blind guy has new eyes, which is good, they belong to a bad werewolf. Unpleasant things begin to happen when the guy turns into a creature that looks like a cheese. Can he find a cure before his girlfriend finds out? Who is this strange little troll who is helping him and what is going on with this policewoman? If you really want to know, check out Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to have spent a lot of time in pre-production before deciding to shoot the film.
