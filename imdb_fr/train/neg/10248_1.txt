The end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the box, but you must know that he is a big fan of the mega star actor Christopher Lee that I was fooled. like the tentacles (77), a good distribution does not mean that it will be a good movie.The beginning looks promising, then it becomes boring, many parts of the film are too dark to see what happens.The rest of the distribution is presented. briefly as Lew Ayres, Dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard.I would expect better from the Charles group who made good fun movies like the resuscitator and the dolls.I heard that Christopher Lee was brought to make this film. He was his co-stars were going to be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger. Dean Jagger is here, but the other two have never done it (lucky) if you make a film about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and better story. Jagger has made two good movies later: alligator (80) and game of death (79), continue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie without his pacifier.If you are a glutton in punishment, then watch the end of the movie the world I challenge you to say awake throughout the movie. 1 out of 10
