This film (with Rinne) is a minor jewel among the tribute to retreading images that have gone on for horror movies at 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And, yes, they are low praise. Because there is no worse in the cinema than potential writers who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. It's a movie that was done almost entirely in the director's head. Of course, it would have been nice if he had transferred it to film, but it happened instead. It's a very nice movie with some genuine frights, but the last reel is strictly reserved for the lazy filmmaker crowd.
