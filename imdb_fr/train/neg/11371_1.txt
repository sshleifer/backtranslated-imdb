The "documentary", and we apparently use this term roughly, summarizes the fact that Muslims are trying to conquer the world violently. Then declares that every Muslim who does not admit this ignores either his own faith or lies in the face! In addition, each person interviewed in the film found a market for its absurd vision of reality by selling the trap to the conservatives ready to let others think for themselves. What the West NEEDs to know is that this is only propaganda for the mental dwarves. If you are looking for a documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that offers multiple points of view from qualified sources.
