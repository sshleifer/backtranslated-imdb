Well where to start here? Straightheads introduces me a bit of the dilemma. If this film, released in Italy in 1975 for example, was directed by Ruggero Deodatto and played by David Hess, then I would get it up faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to Grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has produced a Grindhouse rape / revenge photo in England, and apparently with the same budget that would have led Rodriguez to transform Rose's leg McGowan in a machine gun. Because if you want to play Grindhouse bingo, let me remind you of the "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. A wealthy, wealthy high-flying woman meets a bit of the wrong side of the bad side of tracks in an improbable way and, just as improbably, waiting for him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Free plans of said high-flying woman in various states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Complicated and highly improbable plot development that installs characters that exist only to do what they do and that can not be imagined to exist outside the scenes where they are. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. Scene of needlessly graphic rape perpetrated by a group of men without perceptible depth of personality or background other than their identity. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Murderous and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to end Bingo! <br /> <br /> In summary, Straightheads is a fairly basic activity: Dyer meets Anderson and invites him to a party in a reserve in the country owned by his boss. On their way home, they vexed three Landover residents who took revenge by giving Dyer good service and raping Anderson. The couple began to take revenge. So far, so "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House at the Park's Edge", "I spit on your grave" etc. So why did not I think about this movie? A number of reasons: I guess Gillian Anderson's presence in the cast suggests that it's better, but it's the total lack of honesty here rather than the quarrels. <br /> <br /> Sit down to watch Hess and his ilk terrorize women and murder their men in these 70s period pieces, so they always know exactly what they're getting - quickies on a budget designed only to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The wicked terrorize and murder the treats, the treats reverse the situation and kill them in return, and everyone goes home satisfied, his desire to see some nasty violence extinguished and safe, knowing that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, as a screenwriter and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads has much more to say about the state of the human psyche than that and is desperately trying to immerse himself in his film. a philosophical depth that is simply not there. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a 14-year-old girl who is an object of envy for the two men with whom he hangs out. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he raped her only by distraction so that his two companions can divert their attention from his daughter! The flippant and daring way in which Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply breathtaking. It's almost as if he expects this simple reference to pedophilia to be enough to lay the spectator's foundation on morale and push them to leave the cinema thinking that I've just passed through some significant thing. To make sure everything is well understood, we are now shown a second sequence of the rape sequence, apparently from the attacker's point of view and his concern for his daughter, but Reed assures us that we will have many more blows. . Anderson's wrist brutally violated on the hood of his car. Free entry does not enter. <br /> <br /> After learning the reasons for his rape, Anderson hangs him over a table and shoves a sniper rifle at him (with a cumbersome muffler, in case not clear on phallic imaging), but lacks the courage to pull the trigger, telling Dyer (who does not have the same moral scruples) that "it's over". Dyer says the opposite and their moral dilemma is presented as a question that Wittgenstein and Russell might have discussed in their room in Cambridge at tea and cake time. He is almost unbearable in his ridicule. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, Ms. Anderson is courageous throughout the film. It is obvious that she wants to leave Scully far behind and, bless her, she certainly does; One wonders what Mulder could have done with his former partner who was squatting to escape from the side of the road and sodomizing a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he has done in virtually every film he has made so far, that is, he embodies a cock cock gor blimey chappie with a a mischievous smile, a cheeky line and a face that most people would never have tired of hitting. This is especially true on the closing scene where, after murdering his cold-blooded attackers, Dyer looks at the camera, which I'm sure I want, a look of existential angst that invites us to sympathize with the fate of fate faced him, as well as the moral dilemmas he had to overcome, but he reminds much more Oliver Hardy who casts an exasperated look at the camera after Stan has landed him in another brothel. Which, incidentally, pretty much sums up this film.
