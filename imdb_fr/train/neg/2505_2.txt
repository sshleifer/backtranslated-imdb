I've seen enough of Little Richard in interviews and performances and enough poor Leon pigeons in these 50/60s bio-music photos to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was so right that David Ruffin in The Temptations, but fails to capture the essence of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in "Why do crazy people fall in love?" was a much more appropriate choice, having managed to extract the powerful but effeminate character of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the film will be too. And that's what happened here. LR's incursions into homosexuality and voyeurism are ignored or totally ignored. What "The Temptations" has been so successful at capturing the band's rise, warts and all, this movie is missing a lot. <br /> <br /> What's going on with director Robert Townsend who started so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented and funny guy, but who has nothing to do with this first effort.
