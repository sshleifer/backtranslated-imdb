Good lord, whoever made this turkey must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other critic must not have seen this movie, he must look at something else, or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says what, it's as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Incredibly funny characters, incredibly incredible characters, absurd situations, it looks like the film was shot in Griffith Park (which works pretty well - MASH was shot at Griffith Park), a dismal scenario, just about everything which could possibly be wrong with a film all filmed in one package. Should be mandatory for all potential filmmakers to watch how a movie could be horribly wrong. It reminds me of something that a USC student can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Give him a pass unless you take drugs and you are in the high camp.
