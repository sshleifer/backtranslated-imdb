The original movie (dated 19 ??) did not show any "monster", he was content to suggest "scary" things. <br /> <br /> This version, however, presents all aspects of a "sick spirit ghost", including unnecessary elements. special effects . <br /> <br /> The "mystery", as presented in the original movie, was the scariest part: we just did not know what was causing the strange things going on. Showing the face of the "old man", this gentleman has completely disappeared. Even worse: the special effects (faces of crying wooden children) are ridiculous. It's a stupid remake, too obviously spectacular to be as close as the scary of the original
