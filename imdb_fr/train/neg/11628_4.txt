Wow, you are too nice! Corny, Corny, Corny That's how I feel about this movie.It started well with a good idea, a guy (Edward Asner) escaping prison dressed as Santa Claus, a group of children discovers him and believe it's the real Santa Claus, so the Fake Santa asks the kids to help him find a bag of stolen money. The film is like a Christmas version of "Whistle down the wind". The film starts well, but little by little, it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that in the end, it becomes ridiculous and you simply can not take this film seriously. For example, you get the character of type Scrooge called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a total Douchebag who treats his young son like a pile of garbage, he treats his son so badly that he does not even buy decent clothes, the poor child is wearing jeans with holes in it! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie, the guy all happy to sing Christmas Carol and give a hug to his neglected son ... yeah that's how Corny ... I'm everything to feel good, especially at Christmas and I'm a big fan of the TV movie season, but this one is far too exaggerated for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the second half of the film devotes a supernatural element to the film that just does not fit the rest. It's not totally bad, there are good actors, especially children, but there are many better Christmas movies.
