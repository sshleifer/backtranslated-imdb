I tried to watch this movie twice and each time, I still could not go to the final credits. The first time, I managed to pass the first fight sequence and then lose interest. The second time, I managed to force myself to digest over an hour of mediocre play, lame SFX and bad direction. Blades in comparison with the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old ETAtari 2600 fiasco? For those who did not let me inform me. It's 1982 ... AND is one of the biggest box office hits of all time ... Atari decides to launch a video game in their 2600 home console system. To summarize a long and painful story financial, the game failed and resulted in thousands of Atari 2600 games AND to be thrown into landfills because they could not even give them away, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at number 3.2 and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Dreadful movie ... IMDb forced me to give it a 1 in 10 because their rating system does not go as low as 0, let alone in the negatives.
