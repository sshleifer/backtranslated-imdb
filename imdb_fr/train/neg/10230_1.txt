Arrived on a copy of this. Not mine and if I had spent my own money for that, I would find those responsible and I would demand them! All I can say is a dreadful student movie. Any understanding of the medium of the film is absent. Acting is awful, the story would have been rejected by the original series of Twilight Zone as being unoriginal and lame, and the change of tone of the reaction of the main character to the "ghost" is laughable. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "complimentary" critics of this film are written by friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even entertaining. <br /> <br /> Amateur to the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! To avoid! To avoid!
