And that's all there is. This thing is slow. The actors have abilities, they just do not seem motivated to make the effort. The plot is not terrible and is still hampered by the slowness mentioned above. The accents, when there are any, are British. Many of these people are supposed to be Danes. Okay, all right, the accents are not that important. But the language is. I do not think they used words like "yeah" and "OK" in Beowulf's day. And what supposedly cool weapon that his king gave him? Has he already reloaded this thing? Has he ever seen it? Or was Beowulf such a bad goal? Well, his goal was at least the computer graphics used to generate the monsters. These were rather off. Bad special effects. Bright point? Just one that I can think of. Marina Sirtis has held up well over the years.
