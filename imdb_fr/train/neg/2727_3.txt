This quirk in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not really need to be included because it is in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What she does, however, is shine when she is on screen. The film about the quasi-plot is only an excuse to introduce some of the Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE is promising and it's a pity she did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN assumes the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if it was in color. The basics of the Travis Air Force with some rear projections work well. The best part of the film is some wonderful musical interludes. If you liked THANKS LICKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you'll love this one.
