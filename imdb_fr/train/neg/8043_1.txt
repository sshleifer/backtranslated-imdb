Normally, I have no problem getting away from a bad movie, but it was a unique case. This film was so bad that I sat down pretty much while praying that he would have a good movie minute to justify the lost hour and a half. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Located in a beach house where a group of college friends celebrate their holidays, this film suffers from many problems and is therefore not worth seeing. First, there are gaping ground holes. Secondly, very few actors in the C list (I do not even dare call them B) can play a vital role, so all the scenes that have potential fail miserably. Thirdly, the film's pace is very unstable and hard to watch most of the time, making suspense building very difficult, resulting in very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the end is completely anti-climatic in part because of the way it ends (definition / that turns out to be the killer) and partly because the dialogue is just awful. To the credit of the movies, it's the only film I'll ever say, it's the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So just like a bad joke, you'd have If you've been happier than ever to hear, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you're going to scream no you really do not do it while running in the opposite direction.
