I'm a guy who likes guy movies ... I could not wait to see a dragon fight with the army with cool special effects. All of this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was classic, but his performance was horrible. The scene transitions are the worst I have ever seen. Why would you go out on a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The actions of the dragon-snake were very poorly written ... and the dragon-snake's attack abilities varied considerably throughout the film. Many times, the main characters should have died. In the middle of the film during the most stressful periods, this film was obviously not watched after turning it. I love movies, but I had to force myself to finish watching it. . <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, just look at the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
