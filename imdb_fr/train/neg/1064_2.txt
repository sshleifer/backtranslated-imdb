be warned: this film tells many stories of love without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The only intention of this film seems to be to show love in different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a rough idea of ​​a plot. The writer tried to introduce turning points to surprise the viewer. However, it did not work because you never got to know the previous characters or that these "jokes" were just silly. <br /> <br /> This is a film about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
