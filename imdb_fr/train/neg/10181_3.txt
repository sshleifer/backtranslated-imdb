This movie is so bad that it's funny. He is played by Scott Backula as a coach, but it's not important, it's the big black man who plays at first. First, he must be at least 75 years old and yet play baseball in the minor leagues. Then he starts the film in the outer field despite his inability to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly by telling him that when he tries to run, he stays in one place for too long. Backula shows a brighter training strategy at the end of the film (SPOILER), he tells his star player "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly that the "downtown" sees a good shot . He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league team playing the Twins who were the class of majors in the movie. Now, if only Tony Muser, the Royals coach, was a coach as smart as Backula and asked his players to simply hit a home run each time, the Royals would never end a round, let alone lose a match.
