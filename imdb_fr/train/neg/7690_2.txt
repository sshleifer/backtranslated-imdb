Anyone who gives a good review of this film must obviously have been involved in its creation. This film is a painful suckfest. The acting is rigid, the generic soundtrack is laughable, the direction is bland and the strangest of all, the teacher is really not so attractive (making the blatant progress of the student all the more embarrassing ). Creative minds hiding behind this basket should dissolve and expand to prevent further exposure of such concentration. I am convinced that some hungry African children could have used the money squandered for this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened purpose fueling an addict; at least someone would be entertaining. For the only reason he did not give me a terminal illness, I will give two to this movie.
