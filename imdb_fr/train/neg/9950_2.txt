If the original casting idea had been retained (chasing Rutger, not Ice-T), this film could have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to enter (literally) the table and ruin it. The predominantly black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they exchanged the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. It was only the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's management approach to management only confirmed that this was another positive action task. Master shot, close-up, close-up. Gads, "Who has the same line as that" even uses a more creative camera work. Rewriting "The Most Dangerous Game" by Eric is at least an attempt to modernize the classic tale, but gives us no motivation to explain why the characters are doing it. We are never given the reasons, other than "nobody will miss these people", why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Aside from a sincere performance by John McGinley and a fair job from Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one. A little anecdote: there was a real drunk driving accident during the shooting that injured F.Murray Abraham and resulted in the death of the drunk driver who caused the accident.
