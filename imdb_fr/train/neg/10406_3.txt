Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> The writers of the first Tremors are officially running out of ideas. I am a big fan of the first movie and the first two suites are pretty good for the video rate. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie. Where the hell are the Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids in the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry in the series is supposed to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not an interesting character in the film, except for the character of Billy Drago who is given too few lines, too little to do and finally too little time to do it. screen. What saved the second and third films is the presence of Michael Gross in the role of Burt Gummer. Whenever there was no onscreen action, you can rest assured that Burt Gummer will be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this film, Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, when the Graboids (the dirt dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good, but it's about as good only that. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was registered at 101 minutes. Pretty good for the right to video. But after watching it, I'm sure this movie lasts 15 minutes too much. There are long dialogues that are boring and do not advance the plot. Was there a hurry to make this movie? I think no, more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I touched a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packed for sale with .... Tremors !!! How lucky I thought, pay for # 4 get # 1 for free. After watching Tremors 4, I think I paid the original and got this mess free, I can not imagine paying a single penny for Tremors 4. For the fans of the series, it is better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins gets a score of 3 out of 10.
