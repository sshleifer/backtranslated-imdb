This version is probably available on DVD on your local dollar store. The impression is not good, nor the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes to win, you will get your money (which does not mean much). Anna Neagle is extremely tasteless as Nanette. Whatever his charms, they are not obvious in this film. A large number of actors of character are part of this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material misses remarkably of their talents. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the best use of weak writing. The musical numbers (there are really only two) are quite horrible. It is clear that the studio did not feel obliged to take advantage of the rich musicality of the original "No, no, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be purchased for $ 1.00. It is worth saying that you have seen it.
