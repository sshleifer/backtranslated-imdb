After watching this on the MST3K episode, I wonder how many movies this movie borrows. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point, I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea of ​​the number of holes in the plot. like the fact that, even though gasoline is not available, there are many in abandoned service stations, which are close enough to one another to allow an F1 race car to cross the country.
