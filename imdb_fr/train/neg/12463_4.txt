OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm lying because it's true. I am a conservative but the policy that I will leave out of my opinion about the film. This film was anti-Bush, anti-Middle East, anti-big oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off, I will pay tribute to merit. I attended the opening night of the film because I like this kind of films and I am a major in political science of collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was to the extent that I could say very well. <br /> <br /> The plot was impossible for me to decode though. I was tested and my intelligence quotient is 138, but despite all my efforts, it was impossible to reconstruct the plot of the film and the characters where to do what. <br /> <br /> The story and the scene The sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless it's one of those movies he's supposed to watch several times to get the full depth of the story, that it may very well be, I'm I have no exact idea of ​​what was happening. <br /> <br /> What makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument without receiving criticism, make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not dazzle them brilliantly, baffle them with Bull S.
