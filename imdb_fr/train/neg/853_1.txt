Ok, honestly, I do not see why everyone thinks it's so great. It really is not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can take my hat off. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No one else has become stupid enough. And what did Stanley Kubrick think he had chosen Shelly as Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she was scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have had more respect for that if Kubrick would have ended otherwise. And, the movie as a whole was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So do not see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.
