I like the period, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like a bottle of coca gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were so blurry and fuzzy, I would upgrade my computer. This may be the look the director was looking for, but not so much that it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not brought someone with me to this film, I was out of there. Although it was a series and not a film, Band of Brothers succeeded. It looked like a World War II movie, with just a hint of grain, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real sets and real places; Use CGI when it's convenient, not for an entire movie.
