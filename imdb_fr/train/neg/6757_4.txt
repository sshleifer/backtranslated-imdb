Odd Slasher Film producer Charles Band. At the time of Full Moon's biggest hit, the band said it would never make "real killer movies" because it believed that little puppets and big monsters added a fancy element that improved the movies. - The killings is so real and less fun. It's a beautiful philosophy and a real shame that the band, after destroying the Full Moon studio through poor commercial relations, has become so desperate by the benefits of home theater that it has begun doing exactly what Blockbuster does. wanted, and therefore sacrificed his creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Birth Rite' - both equally bland compared to the full moon. Debbie Rochon is in her usual form as a novice in a gang of dudes and dudes who decide to create the story of a "murder club". As everyone knows, she does everything in her power to join her, then panic sets in because it was not a true and stupid story, Ms. Rochon believed. Now everyone will have to cover themselves with blood and kill themselves or maybe kill themselves. do not. The choice is there and, with regard to this film, it belongs to you ... not recommended but not entirely bad either.
