The movie was awful. The theater was dead of silence because everyone was embarrassed to be there to look at such garbage. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and asked him to run a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old. Martial arts are "ok," but when you put them next to Jackie Chan's movies and "The Matrix," you better see one.
