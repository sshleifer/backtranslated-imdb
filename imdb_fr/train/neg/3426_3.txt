As a fan of Go Nagai's manga and anime (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this one. I had not seen the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceived idea. Good thing too. What we have here is a series of stupid softcore movies of the type that appeared with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. Although it is docile compared to what we hear in the gorges of regular cable TV viewers (the villainous fragments of our hero are either elegantly concealed behind a strategically stuck scarf, or adorned with a ray effect of ridiculous sun), there are long scenes of bondage and torture lend to the procedure just smarminess enough to make it unfit for children. Although I have absolutely nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur-made movies (there are at least four in this series). On the positive side, there is at least one incredibly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I've seen. No wonder TESTICLE BOY from Nagai has never done it ...
