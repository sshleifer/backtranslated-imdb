If there was a scale less than 1, it would be -10, in the footsteps of Godspell. The acting game (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, the plot in disarray. And Rene Russo was incredibly sweet in his role, enough to make someone vomit. Ten inches for a silent movie. Salvator Grace: congratulations on the period costumes.
