I must say that I was really looking forward to watching this movie and finding a new life in it that would separate it from the dullest and most elaborate Mexican films. I do not know why, but I relied on Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to breathe freshness and confidence into our non-existent industry. This may be because the soundtrack (which I had listened to before watching the movie) sounded different, perhaps because it dared to include new faces (except for Demian Bichir, who is still one of the favorites of the Mexican directors) in his scenario, with a modern social behavior, perhaps because they are photographs that I saw in the trailers, luminous and realistic instead of being theatrical. The film proved to be a major pleasure for the crowd and a major disappointment. What Serrano actually deals with here is the very old "battle of the sexes" as in "all men are the same" and "why are all women ..."; blah, blah, blah Nothing new in it, not even that, he uses so many common points and clichés that he ends up making fun of himself without leaving any valid reflection on the feminine / masculine condition. Full of usual tramps on the public like gags about the clichés I mentioned before (those who always work, always) and gaudy performances (it's a well-played movie in its context) ... and by shouting, I mean, literally. The most fascinating characters at the beginning interpreted by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be, according to Serrano, the most pathetic. I completely disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated that way just to be puppets so that his lesson was passed on ... he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only story terrain could have stood. Anyway, it's after all a very entertaining movie and you'll probably have a good time seeing it (if you agree to be handled by it).
