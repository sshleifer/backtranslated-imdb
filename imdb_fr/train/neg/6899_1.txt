Have you ever wondered why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic background? Well, this movie will not provide an answer to this often asked question - but it will be an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this film is a sort of "old school" for New Zealand Pacific Islanders. which immediately raises the question of what exactly is the purpose of such a task. Is it supposed to perpetuate the entrenched stereotypes of New Zealand Pacific Islanders? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes without humor, and the end is expected. This film did nothing for the New Zealand cinema, because it is only an appropriate romantic comedy and devoid of any merit.
