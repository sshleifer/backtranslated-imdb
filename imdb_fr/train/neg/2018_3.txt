Do not get me wrong, this is a dreadful and cliche film, but it's a delight for Olivia Hussey fans - arguably the most intoxicating beauty that has ever existed on the big screen. A poster said it was unpleasant to watch - I wonder what does his ideal wife look like - Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster should really establish a subgenre for this type of movie, because the plot of Fatal Attraction has become a genre in itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the Adultry section? This will fit well enough between the drama and action sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered her ex-wife, who looks remarkably like Mrs. Hussey. This clever little pursues Olivia and makes his life a hell. I love Olivia Hussey, but I do not feel sympathy for movie characters who are cheating on their spouses. So I really did not want Olivia to bring out that vivid smell. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There's a bit of violence in the movie, Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get into a fight when Denison says he'll never stop seeing Olivia Murray's wife, because she's too good in bed Olivia must also fend off a shooter and he may have the opportunity to make a pass - I'll let you look.) NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen she has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - shot from a distance. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (We have already seen this plot - a hundred times, and often much better done.) What is true William Riead is the culprit who tries to understand why this film is a failure. is a sophomoric and stupid man who has no capacity for storytelling and does not succeed in human reactions to the intrigue.These people, from the upper layers of society, speak like college students - with the habit of sleeping during I have placed Riead on the Never seen (Again) list. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (The role of actor has not been "telephoned" as the saying goes the insiders, but was impeded Olivia Hussey calls Anthony Jonh Denison "weird" and "crazy" when he starts chasing her .. Hussey, who is still so handsome, delivers here the best performance but Denison was equal to Don Murray was essentially there : his character is not fleshed out, and Edward Asner, a great actor who re something substantial, is poorly used in this film).
