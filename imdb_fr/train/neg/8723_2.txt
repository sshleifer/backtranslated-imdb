Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but it's not worth looking for. This scam with the Italian mouth does not make much sense most of the time, any more than the rest. "The alligator" is not at all convincing, and many subplots are not going anywhere. If it's in the local video store, you can watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth looking for.
