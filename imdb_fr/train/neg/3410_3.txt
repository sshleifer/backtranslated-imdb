Yes, this film has children who go to the space camp and it starts well enough when we make them meet and learn the ropes. Then, they introduce Jinx, a robot that would not exist in 1986 because they have nothing with this kind of artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a buddy with a robot and the latter repairs his kindness by shooting at him, as well as a group of other children from this camp, with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach the 'space. This camp is not very fun either because these children are really trained and the instructors master them for failing in their missions or not doing things right. Rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts, just give them the experience of a space flight, not a military camp. However, you can see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather early role. So in the end a film that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you might as well make sure that the kids are fighting aliens over all the rest of the film, this film a little more pleasant at least for me. Probably for some others too, who else would want to see Kate Capshaw's face torn apart by a strange alien creature.
