What can you say about this movie? It was not great, but it was not good! Two days ago, I watched Lillies and it was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. It was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was silly and the acting was OK. It was not serious enough to extinguish it, but there were difficult moments and terrible stereotypes. The casting was not very good either. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this film? No, you would lose your time and money. I do not understand why films like these are made and who finances them. Spend your time looking at Noah's Arc on Logo instead. I think that's where this movie was trying to go but never happened.
