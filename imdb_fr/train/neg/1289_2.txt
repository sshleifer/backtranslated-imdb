It was a new historical record for westerns. The writing is atrociously bad, the characters are impossible to point out and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically unconvincing. And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, somnambulist of his expressionless eyes and his hoarse voice, which betrays only Mannerism. 'Ride With the Devil' is one of my five worst cinematic experiences, a western never to be exceeded in negative respect.
