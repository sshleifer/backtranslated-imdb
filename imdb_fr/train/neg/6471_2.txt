It's a movie that's bad in every way imaginable. Of course, we like to know what happened 12 years after the last film, and it works at a certain level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is horribly horrible! Alas, while the logic that humans can not stay underwater forever is maintained, other basic physical logics are ignored. It's cold if you do not have clothes for cold weather if you're in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the reviews here are not so good, I thought this one was more horrible.
