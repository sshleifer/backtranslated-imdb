I love the music of Clash and the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this film hoping to learn more about the man behind all this. But I left the theater not knowing much about Joe that I had already done after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The film never really reaches the person, his thoughts and his feelings. They simply collected the little material they had, blurry and shaky videos, and interviewed people about Joe Strummer at a campfire. It turned out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director only wanted them in the film to allow other celebrities to say, "Oh, he was such an inspiration for all of us". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (to whom they apparently would have asked to keep his pirate costume to take advantage of his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director can not even wait until the body is cold before launching to sell his version of the "greatest punk rocker and hippie bottom" who has ever lived, sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him. <BR /> <br /> Of course, as a fan, I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the band, hearing the stories behind the songs, and so on. -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie if you're a fan, if not listen better to the Clash's music or better yet the unduly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, basing all its rich influences in an incredible sound.
