It's almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the rug under this one for me. The accessories are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis". It seems that the spatial scenes were made in a power station of the 50s, just before the demolition. The music is really bad. The actors play is in wood and ham. The characters they describe are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately obvious to copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of management is a distrust. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if only to experience what must be one of the biggest messes of a small budget to date. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
