After watching about half of that, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I persevered to the end. It's a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is mediocre - much worse than the T & A movies of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Several attempts at humor fail miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Maybe if you're a teenager, this movie will have some appeal, but for those who have seen a lot of movies, you'll know how the movie will go after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony while waiting for the end credits. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking at this.
