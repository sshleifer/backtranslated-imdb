SLASHERS (2 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> This is not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... had to work with it. The film is apparently an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several candidates to a closed "danger zone" and three costumed ghosts were sent to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, gains fame and fortune ... everyone eventually dies. The main disadvantage of this movie is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seems real. The actors who play the killers are quite amusing, as they portray careless and exaggerated cartoons of popular types of modern horror movies ... and that's exactly what would happen if it were a real show. The film claims to be complete: there is a cameraman who follows the competitors around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the light continues to blink constantly (to hide the "cuts" from one take to another, I imagine).
