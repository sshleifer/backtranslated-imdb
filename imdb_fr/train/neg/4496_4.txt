This film is a grimace of bad actors and mediocre settings, as well as pure lines and lame intrigues. But it's so much fun to watch. The basic plot is a group of scientists of the future time travel to capture their evil colleague who is determined to destroy them all. They join him in 1146. The "futuristic" scientists' laboratory of 2033 is an 80's style room with a group of flashing "futuristic" buttons and a control capsule resembling a lawn. The actors deliver their lines with a low enthusiasm, which is not difficult to understand given that the lines are usually earthquake-like, like "I checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice? He checked four times? Not only that, but they feed you from the premise of the film in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid rate of fire until they reach the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop traveling through time and therefore different sets. The medieval ensemble is a comic mishmash from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess the coats were not part of the budget because the guys are all wearing a glitter shirt pretending to be armor. Battle scenes are laughable, men casually flinging on cardboard swords with surrender and dying in death blows that seem to be really terrible, but I appreciate them every time I look at them. The lines alone are enough for you to have problems and everything else is together to create a fabulous movie B that, if you are a connoisseur of nerdy movies, I would advise you to see it. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love to hear them highlight all the fun and terribly horrible elements of the movie.
