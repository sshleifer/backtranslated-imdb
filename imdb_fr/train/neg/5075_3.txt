The animation was good, the pictures were good, although not entirely original, however, the story was too long, much too confusing and dramatic. After about an hour, I could not wait to finish. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute and who complement elements that come from nowhere or go nowhere, this movie was not really a film and would have been better as a short series or maybe two movies. If you like that kind of typical story, you may like it, but frankly, I've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have a message to tell. Rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you'll come out a lot more.
