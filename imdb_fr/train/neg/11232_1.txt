It's so sad. Even though it was shot with a movie, I think it stinks a bit more than movies like Blood Lake, There There Nothing. The music they play is the funniest music I have ever heard. I like brother and sister in this movie. They are not trying to sound sarcastic when they say things like, "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, why does the killer just wear his mask at the beginning? It's delayed! I practically ignored the second half of this. What I like most about this film is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. The same exact sound for each chop!
