Just think that it cost $ 250,000 in total to make "clerks". How could they spend $ 45 million to make this glorified music video? A virtually unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I can see ... I know, it had to be spent on this cleverly designed, economical and energized scenario. Shoot, this set of bars must have cost a package. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer would not be surprised producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he did not blow anything up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not a horrible film, I suppose. The female lead roles seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a shame that this rather mediocre project could have been done for $ 5 million without any loss of production and that 6 other $ 5 million merit films could also have been shot.
