Randall "Memphis" Raines is a large, retired car thief who is forced to return to "play" when his younger brother is about to die, for failing to execute an order from British crime chief Raymond Calitri . The job is to "lift" 50 cars in 24 hours, otherwise Calitri will execute his punishment. So Raines quickly sets up a crew he can trust and tackles the task. But the police are watching him and some of the cars on the list are not easy to pick up. It would seem like a job almost impossible to accomplish. <br /> <br /> He has a whole cast left in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Christopher Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. All deserve better. Sufficient interim power to power a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that it is many cars that clutter the parking lot, characters, not enough zest. At first glance, there is no doubt that it is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a crazy script with loud noises and a cheese whip, an edition of a shotgun, and a sledgehammer staging. by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a remake of H.B. big budget. Halicki's independent film, dating back to 1974, bearing the same name and offering the potential of an automotive-based film powered by adrenaline. Potential that unfortunately never comes true. There are one or two moments of high impact, silly, but nice anyway. But if you forgive the pun, the movie never goes into high gear, it is more than happy to work with its many characters who are grieving to try to run the crude scenario {Scott Rosenberg}. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something {cars look good}, as fans of unintentional comedy movies {check out Ecclestone Carpenter's Mourning Moment}. But no, it's really rather poor in everything. 4/10
