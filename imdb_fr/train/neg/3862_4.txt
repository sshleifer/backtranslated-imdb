I just watch it. A few bursts of laughter, but nothing writing. Jason Lee seemed to be having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel consists almost exclusively in uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be hitting a clock, but again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played the role of Julia Stiles's (hilarious) father in 10 things I hate about you is also funny here. It's great, but the best part about this movie was Julia Stiles' cast. I could spend two hours watching her bend the laundry and I feel like I just did it.
