What a fantastic premise: a film about the Berlin airlift. He should have everything. The tragedy. Suspense. Camaraderie. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and the tough American pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of it. Heino Ferch tries to personify John Wayne, but he fails miserably. It is so much wood that it should crack at any time. He tries to play hard, instead of being a tough guy! Why would the character of Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with him? Because they threw stones in a lake? Because he brings him charcoal bricks? SFX is very, very well done. Too much though. Hundreds of planes over Berlin look like an attack-formation training squadron rather than an organized airlift ?? as it really was. It is interesting to note that the White House, the Kremlin and the office of General Lucius D. Clays all seem to be one and the same dark and dusty ensemble. Notice the same curtains hanging from the bottom of the windows as a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, appears as a little insecure general, unsure, who trusts his noble idea, the airlift. He was really the opposite. So you combine all these individual blunders and you get a movie that does not build any passion, suspense or historical precision. Sad, it started so promising ??
