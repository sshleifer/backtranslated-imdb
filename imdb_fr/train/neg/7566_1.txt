Before the release of this album, Neil LaBute had said about the 1973 original: "It's amazing how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack, I'm like, come on! may not like the news, but if it's your favorite soundtrack, I do not know if I want you to like my movie. "<br /> <br /> Neil, one word. You may want to sit down for that too; As Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with bent knees. You see, Neil, the original is that the soundtrack of Paul Giovanni is one of the most famous things about it. Filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. With Richard, Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, he practically launched the New Wave Folk of the 1970s. The sapper is like imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or the story of Buddy Holly without Buddy Holly. This is the most arrogant and astonishing remake of a British cult classic since Get Carter by Sly Stallone. <br /> <br /> The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks". So disturbed, during this two-week period, he had the idea of ​​reinventing one of the most nuanced films on interfaith struggle ever imagined by a screenwriter-director previously known for his utterly subtle representations of chauvinism male. It's like a board game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah played against Bambi? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Noe has redone the love, in fact? (Actually, I'd like to see that) Unfortunately, someone took this board game seriously: all that LaBute has managed to do is tear the guts of the original while associating it with his own insignificant concerns in Sex War. <br /> After failing to save a little girl and her mother from a fatal car accident, the Cage policeman on the highway turns into a medicated torpor. Then, he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (who swaps name tributes for congratulations), who now lives in the private island community of Summersisle ?? this extra 's' means 'superfluous' ?? and wants Edward to help locate the missing girl, Rowan. <br /> <br /> Summersisle, is it obvious, is a female-dominated commune, conceived as a haven for oppressed women and refugees from the witch trials of Salem. Here, the matriarchs observe the old ways and the few males are almost mute mules. It's like Lilith Fair on a large scale. The main export of Summersisle is honey ?? a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he is allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" Edward screams. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well, it's probably because the main export of Summersisle is honey. <br /> <br /> While doing his research, Edward hears an impending Mayday ritual called "the moment of death and rebirth". He discovers that the harvest of the previous year has failed. almost dies of bee stings; and finally comes to the conclusion (a conclusion that obviously could not be more obvious if the inhabitants of the city had tattooed a calendar of events on the back of the hand) that Rowan would be burned alive in a pagan rite to ensure an abundant harvest . He also meets the queen bee of the hive, sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who herself has plans for him regarding the eponymous character of Wicker Man: "The drone must die." <br /> <br /> First of all, the good news: any worries could be raised at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters. That's about all for the good news. "It's a story whose chapters have been carefully written," writes Burstyn with sublime irony. While retaining the basic premise of the cat and the mouse (and typography of credits), what remains assigns the original to a scorched earth policy. <br /> <br /> Shaffer's original script was crucial: his Christian copper, according to ritual, came to the island of his own free will ?? and above all, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. By reducing things to a sexual struggle, as opposed to a religious power struggle, LaBute presents the most fragile of the qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage realized he was the bait, honestly, you did not care. <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things in this area; a dragging and dragging donkey ?? an arsewit whose tongue seems just too big for his mouth. "Good God," he moaned after hallucinating a drowned Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who woke his alarm clock half an hour too early. We hope that it is the frequent dependence of his character to the pills that reduced him to this state ?? alternately tired, then full of vim. If this is the case, it is a very good portrait of an undifferentiated IQ plus antidepressants. Otherwise, do not think about it. As Willow, saucer-eyed Beahan is just as appalling, presenting her lines as if she were competing with Cage for the "shyest" delivery. While Burstyn totally misses the mercurial threat to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Every element that made the original great ?? the detailed descriptions of folk customs with love, the ingenious partition, the dialogue (the majestic "You did it admirably!" of Lord Summerisle was replaced by the less attractive "You did it excellently!" Whoah, dude! ) ?? were replaced by a sinuous thriller starring the battle of the sexes, with occasional blows in the crash-bang. Namely, women who sway; It's a LaBute movie, after all. Sister Beech Bash by Cage is just one of the most embarrassing episodes; helpless little men will be excited at the joy of seeing how their affluent hippie girls finally got what was coming back to them, hyuk hyuk. <br /> <br /> The final coda sees all the mess collapse under the weight of the genre cliché: in a bar, two guys meet two or three girls from Summersisle on leave on the ground, looking for fresh martyrs. By the time they succeed, they almost expect the women to turn around and give an exaggerated wink and congratulations to the camera. <br /> <br /> One more thing: savvy credit watchers may have noticed that movies with an unusually high number of producers (up to 10) are more like real buddies. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.
