Although this seems like a fairly old series (2002), I watched my very first episode last night and I must say that it must be the worst series. . . Never. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to put comments, but I was so shocked that there might be a show that would blatantly try to please, and I guess it was only their target audience, children under 12 years old. seniors or whose IQ is below average. <br /> <br /> The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed stories, trying to include ALL the possible plot summary and while trying to preach about friendship. , family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> Basic story they told in the episode: Frat House went wrong with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be the son of a senator who wants the FBI to investigate him . Death is actually a murder caused by a peanut allergy The senator thinks it could be his nemesis and his best childhood friend who did it because the senator was taking money for his law votes but finally got the conscience and said "no" to mean mulit millionaire. Everyone is suspicious but all have the usual alibi (the ex-student marries a married teacher, so she had to lie, a disgruntled student who was reported by the victim had an experience that changed her life, l Senators' enemy did not pay a desperate student to kill his sworn son, he gives money freely to many broke students). Meanwhile, the heroine of this dribble has her niece who is "the same age" and has a crush on a boy, to whom she finally has the courage to speak with the help of her aunt, but only to throw it away. because 'in' girls say he is not good enough and so stay with them, she lets him down. Do not worry, she returns with her boy after learning the truth about life and girls 'in' let go, Aunt also explains that God is the only person she can really count on (I was almost sick at this moment) . <br /> <br /> This "drama" is still improving when Sue and her FBI team discover the murderer. . . you'll laugh at it, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> This is one of the fraternity brothers who, barely a year ago, discovered that he had been adopted and that his real father was an international terrorist and that he was trying to awesome real dad by killing a boy and placing a bomb at a funeral. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, the acting is cardboard, the continuity is cardboard, the story is cardboard. Anyone who says they like this show has a card for the brain <br /> <br /> Why the authors of this show tried to group EVERY eventuality in the same show means that they obviously have no confidence in the development of the character nor in the ability of the actors to realize a simple plot. Watching this show is like watching "Last Action Hero" with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a toothpick, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, I never thought there would be a day when I say that !!). <Br/> <br /> To use the words of the beloved Simpsons, "comic comic". . . . <br /> <br /> THE WORST SHOW TV. . . . . ALREADY.
