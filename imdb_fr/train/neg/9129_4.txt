There is no way out, this movie is terrible. I've seen Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu's old movies, I'm familiar with the characters and their serial origins, but it's just ridiculous. However, Peter Sellers' genius always shines through in his rendition of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy, and strength running through a stoic facade; This is a performance that I compare to that of Van Helsing by Peter Cushing, but performed in one-tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Cushing's "Dracula" movies. If the film had been shot in a more sero-comic vein than BUBBA HO-TEP through the 1960s AVENGERS TV show, it could have been special. If you're a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers the most complete, it's something you have to see, but it's a pass for anyone.
