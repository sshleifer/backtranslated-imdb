I found it was a waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always has a lack of creativity when shooting movies "straight to the video" - but going back to the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is at its lowest ... coming out soon the original movies with new animation and new songs and call it a "new version of the movie we all love." Surprisingly, Nathan Lane resumes his role of Timon. Timon and Pumbaa, animated animals from the world of the "Lion King" of origin, embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story of how it really happened ... as they see it . <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are lame and the animation is of the shit. The vocal talents are impressive for a feature film, but again, when was the last time you remember that Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane had really commercial content? Overall, if you liked the original, you'll hate it. It is insulting because it is unfair to children and adults. And that, that summarizes.
