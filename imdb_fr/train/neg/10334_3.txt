An incredible selflessness story kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and the plot are totally uninteresting (just like Fulci's crazy camera work, which is usually a redemptive factor in his films), and there is nothing to suggest suspense. It is unbearable - in the end you will not be exciting, but bored (and, like me, perhaps an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves to be busy in a better movie. Gorehounds Fulci, beware! There is simply not much in "The psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
