Body Slam (1987) is a dreadful movie. The budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and the game is lame. But if you like old-fashioned wrestling (from the 1970s to the mid-80s), you'll be more entertained than the average spectator. I must warn you, this movie stinks on the ice. I gave him a two because I wanted to be generous. This turkey was "directed" by Hal Needham, the stunt master. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a group of wrestlers and actors on the list (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The synopsis of this "film" speaks of a promoter who wants to combine "the hair". "But there are other people who do not want him to succeed, there's more, but I do not want to ruin this for you." If you endure the evil and senseless scenario, there are some surprises towards the end for fans of the fierce fight. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend that to my worst enemy (and I sincerely think so).
