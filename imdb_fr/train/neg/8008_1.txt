For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments came from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and` A World Apart 'can not even be compared to this one), and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same musical theme of `Queen Margot' for this film (Watch out for the end of the film). If it was an American pop movie, I would not be surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach to child abuse without any original idea is very simple and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the miners. There are those poor children who hate salespeople and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is this great hero who kills all the wicked and saves these poor children from the wicked. Each character is presented in simple terms in black and white: good against evil. Moreover, from the beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I think the difficult issue of pedophilia and pedophilia is much more complex than the way it is described in this not so original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
