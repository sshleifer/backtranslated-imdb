I should issue an alert everywhere saying that the film should not be watched. It is lacking in a tribute so magnificently that it is almost an insult to the memory of these brave men. The special effects were horrible, I did not expect the director to have totally failed to appreciate the military technology. How can a machine gun that normally fires at a rate of 600 rounds per minute shoot at 1 / 10th of the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when artillery shells fall about 20 meters away? How is it that artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did this lack of respect for weapons terrify me, but also the clichés made me scream murder. There were classical dialogues such as Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, la late mat maro and Pakistan musalmaan jyaada to Hindustaan ​​me hai and cross mats LOC karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without script and it shows. There is no stream in the movie. There is no progressive progression from one battle to another. It is only one fight after another without any connection with the general pattern of the war. The explanatory scenes are dreadful. The chief of staff of the army does not seem convincing. To make matters worse, the theater had cut scenes indiscriminately to adapt the film from four to three o'clock.
