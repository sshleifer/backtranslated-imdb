The "One Leaves" and "Newspapers" campaign suggested (as often) a text much darker and more violent than that presented on the service screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has worked in the cinema for years. This one is quite difficult to find; I'd love to see it again to compare it to the other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember being particularly impressed at the time. Chances are it's a chopped version that was introduced to American theaters and video. But oh, this sheet ... remains a jewel of my latest horror collection.
