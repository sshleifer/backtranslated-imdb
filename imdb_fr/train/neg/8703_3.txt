Primal Species (1996, Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised by the fact that their cargo contains live dinosaurs. Army commandos must now think quickly if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species rather than reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and you get your first impressions of the movie. That is just about everything. The acting is only acceptable from a few characters. The story is poor, with all the film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film was released three years after "Jurassic Park". Instead, this movie seems to have come out 13 years before "Jurassic Park". The dinosaur costumes are so badly made, and I mean costumes. There are obviously people dressed and this film does not try to hide that. A scene where a dinosaur runs down a hallway is created to look like a person riding the creature. The is a good thing, coming out of this movie. The short run time. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not waste your life, but still try to avoid it. <br /> <br /> "It's like a 13th Friday nightmare." - Officer (Brian Currie)
