I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway. God knows how many times and I felt that passion, despair and joy came from this live theater experience. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine "Chorus" for the screen but never figured out how to do it. If the man who proposed the show is puzzled, this should answer your question. Some shows are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough, fresh out of the musical work of "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle", ended up making this film that did not look like the scene. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which made no sense). Michael Douglas has been misinterpreted. People who did not know how to dance tried to play and there was the sexy woman "Landers" who could not sing, play or dance - I guess she had just been Ghandi's wife. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances look like nothing more than schlock of "Flashdance" rejects and nothing works. I was stunned by the way something so captivating and emotional could be drained. If you really like this show and come back to Broadway in 2006 - see it, but do not think that the long-running musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this movie.
