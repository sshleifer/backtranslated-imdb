The French film "Extension of the field of struggle" directed by iconoclast filmmaker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by the controversial writer Michel Houellebecq.He also worked on the script of this film.According to the British magazine Sight This film was hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema because of its unusual theme of sexual politics and its implications for two stupid IT workers. The film is tarnished. by his voice too obvious that introduces us to the main character. It makes us feel as if we are looking at a book that has to read. The basic premise of loneliness problems due to chronic sexual drought is good, but the film disappears as soon as the hero begins to tell the misery he is facing, as well as his friend. Instead of sticking to its main subject, be careful: some viewers might find not only the movie, but even its two heroes as stupid misogynists.
