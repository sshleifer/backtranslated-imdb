Basically, take the concept of each Asian horror ghost movie and crush it into one and you'll get that movie. The story is as follows: a group of students receive voice messages on their own phones that predict their death. There are ghost stories that, if you've seen a movie of Asian ghosts, are not scary so far. This film was quite upsetting because it is very clich√©. It's the same movie, different movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors find themselves in a very delicate situation, so this is something we have never seen before. The two main actors have done a solid job though. <br /> <br /> Regarding gore, there is not much to do. We get a nice sequence that includes an arm twisting head (I do not know how to explain it otherwise), but it was cut off so that you see nothing but the end result. You sometimes see blood, including decapitated arms and a zombie (it looks really cool, I might add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The fears in the movie are sparse and spread out and it's really not so scary. You will sometimes have scary images, but that's not enough for me to consider scary. It's no different than Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of those scared me either. It's really the fall of this movie (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it does not produce scares, it's just not so good. <br /> <br /> Regarding the realization, Takashi Miike did a very good job. employment. He seemed a bit tame in this film compared to his previous films, but he still portrays a lot of his wasted style for which he became famous. Many of the pictures looked a lot like Miike (including a scene with a pile of dead fetal jars), and the last 15 to 20 minutes seemed much more like Miike than the rest of the movie. Nevertheless, the film is vitiated by its originality. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend it to people with a huge passion for Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend it a lot better) or big fans of Miike. Warning to those who want to enter Miike, it's NOT his best job. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 because it's mediocre. Maybe if it came out 4 or 5 years ago, it might be better to have a higher rating. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to quickly talk to you about Asian horror movies. How is it that if it's an Asian horror movie, it's automatically supposed to be good here (US)? MANY of these films are the equivalent to Japan what Scream, Urban Legends and I know what you did last summer were here in the 90 If you've seen one, you've seen them all. And many of these films rely too heavily on images and scenes scare that if they did not produce the alarming effects that they intended to do, simply would not be as good and nothing would change that. More Asian horror movies are more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films which, if they do not scare you and do not be terrified, at least have great stories, theater, setting scene, cinematography and so much more. . Two films that are not just big horror movies, but big movies in general. Most Asian horror movies should be like that instead of the photograph: "A ghost just wanted to be found, then it kills people by phone / tape / home / electrical / water pipes / search engine Google / vibrator / grocery / etc. "
