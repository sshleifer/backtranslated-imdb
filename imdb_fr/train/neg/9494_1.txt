The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I greatly admire. The tracks had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second, I could not believe there was anything deeper than the desire between them. The story did not sound right. Add to that an overheated conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow intrigue that basically leads to nothing, and you have a real stench. Kay Lenz's nude scenes could be worth it for those looking for salacious food, but otherwise it's a colossal waste of time. When I watched the movie, I thought it should have been called "Cheesy".
