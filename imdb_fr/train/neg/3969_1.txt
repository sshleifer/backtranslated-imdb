I write this because I felt like I thought Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst I've seen, it's certainly not good. <br /> <br /> A weak scenario, weak actors and a weak staging. Even if they can not afford big-name roles, is it too much to ask a more attractive main actress? It was painful to see an unpretentious actress throughout the film with her drab interpretation. The story was a clich√© and poorly written. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks used repeatedly here were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the Masters of Horrors episodes. But not quite at the same level as quality movies. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss a movie of this kind, even if it is of poor quality. As with anyone, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
