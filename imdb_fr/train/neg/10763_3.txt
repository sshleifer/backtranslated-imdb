First of all, what is good about the movie? A beautiful actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh while playing (I would do it if I had been in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: a Catholic priest who makes abstract painting seeks to know who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let a little think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "profiling" (the series) with alternative actors and incredible coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives at another victim could have a baby with the priest, etc., etc.).
