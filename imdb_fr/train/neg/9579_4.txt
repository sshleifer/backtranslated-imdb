Here is a horrible version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish it!) With Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke in the role of Candy, a resident of the desert who makes a bank robbery with her boyfriend Johnny ( Jason Durr). He ends up in a prison south of the border headed by the sadistic chief Screw (a Robert Englund overactivated in a forelock). She and her poodle darlings end up hiding in a convent of petrol stations until they are transformed by a recently fallen meteor. Dogs turn into despicable dragons and Candy develops a VERY long, talking and deadly tongue that she can not control. Thugs in search of stolen loot and other matching numbskulls add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and does what is best about this movie. You look at her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including a stunning latex body and tight skin ... and you will wonder how this actress could not have a huge star. It is unfortunate that the rest of this cult attempt is not up to his promise. <br /> <br /> Sciamma, the director / screenwriter of reproaches, thinks that the unusual premise is enough to sustain laughter ... but her vulgar jokes, boring secondary characters and stupid dialogue can not replace a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, many gaudy colors and sets are strangely suffocated by muddy photography and desert and dusty places. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clarke is in her movie because she is the only one to let you watch.
