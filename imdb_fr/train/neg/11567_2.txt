I decided to watch this series after seeing the countless commercials on the BBC in the weeks leading up to its launch. I watched it despite the fact that I do not like the pretentious kind of things written by Alan Hollinghurst (sorry for his fans but I think we have a case of new clothes of the emperor with the work of this author) . I admit that the acting is excellent, that the shooting is beautiful and that it distracts me - but I found that the scenario was extremely thin and after watching the three episodes, I felt very dissatisfied with this production rather empty. The "explicit" gay sex that the media has been talking about has already been filmed on television - many times - I'm afraid this is not very shocking. Fear for the production values, but low for the scenario / content, I'm afraid.
