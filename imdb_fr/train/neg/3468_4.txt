A student filmmaker asks a B-rated actress (a delicious diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror movie that her mother (a terribly dull Kylie Minogue) attempted to do 12 years ago. This is at least a curious plot choice, as any fan of Australian horror knows that the genre is sorely lacking female directors. The movie has a spell, because Molly had to kill a psychopathic murderer on the original board. But she is back because she needs to be exposed. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start to die on the "plateau". Cut is an Australian attempt at the modern slasher, but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, he tears half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Many movies in the world that sound like a "Scream" (except that it's an Australian name - Jane Campion ... see how not so funny) and a lot of "is it real or is it from a movie "the" New Nightmare. " The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl on the camera crew tells the owner of the house she's filming: "Do not worry, we'll treat your house as if it were ours, "he replied," it does not mean anything to me, it looks like you're living in a garbage dump! "Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret have rented this one. "Do you have diet coke here?" (as she gets into the movie teacher's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" ( The first thing she mumbles on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Oh wait, that's what I thought for her.)
