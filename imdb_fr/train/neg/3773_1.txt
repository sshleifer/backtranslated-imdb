When people ask me what is the worst film I have ever seen, this is this one. It's not even close to the MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing in a theater, or even as a late filler of the Disney channel. The only time I always wanted to go to Disney World (or in this case to Disney / MGM Studios) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the model, tear it to shreds and put it in throat saying, "Eat this, eat this dark layer of darkness !!!" I've never been so angry with a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". You want pretty colors and a cinematography? Is not here baby. The critics keep saying "oh, but it looks too much like a comic", well, for me, it's the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. About as nice. Beatty wanders around this landscape hopping and talking with his watch, himself and occasionally with the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the next filming begins. To be fair, I have only seen this film once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a God.
