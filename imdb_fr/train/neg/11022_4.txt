In his own way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, entitled Hallam Foe (I do not see how to describe his main character as "mister")) is a tribute to good acting. Jamie Bell, in the role of Hallam, attractive voyeur and in the creep, and Sophia Myles, in the role of Kate, his perverse partner in the sexual and fantasy novel, are convincing. The problem occurs when you try to link their roles to everything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of the lives of people like Hallam would be legitimately beaten to death. And a woman in Kate's situation would be repulsed and scared - she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> These things however are not what happens in the movie. Poor Hallam's mother passed away and her father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his mother-in-law and lets him know. She slept with him. Kate is a kind of job that places Hallam in a china job and plays sexual games. She looks like her biological mother. All ends well when Hallam "solves" his "problems". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, the piece and the brilliantly interpreted film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, had a similar ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after torn apart. The problem is that it does not always work like that, especially when it does not interest them. In Virginia Woolf, the end is plausible because of the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation never really comes.
