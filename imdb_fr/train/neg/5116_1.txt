I rented this film today thinking it might be a good movie about football, because I'm a big fan of football. Boy, I was wrong. This film is far too religious and preached and is REALLY unrealistic. This movie pretty much says that if you are a Christian, you can easily get everything you want in life, like becoming a great football player! You do not become a great football player by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you anything ... puh-lease. That's not true at all, duh. I laughed a lot because of this embarrassment. The only thing that was funny was when they were stupid (the designer Shultz? No, the guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc. etc.), but this movie was really not great. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
