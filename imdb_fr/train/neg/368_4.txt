This movie is really awkward! I saw him as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this movie to children under 12 years old. I really do not care, but I think it answers some very good questions that kids need to know, such as: 1) Is the money bought? happiness? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things that I think they would not approve of? 3) Does money buy friendships? 4) Is money everything? 5) Should not I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? While these are very unrealistic situations, I think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, perhaps they should also watch this video to show / scare their children that lies can hurt you.
