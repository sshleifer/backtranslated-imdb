A lot of horror fans seem to like Scarecrows, so I would not be very popular saying that I found it rather boring. The idea behind this idea was interesting, but it seems to be dragging on. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies in the dark can work (as in Humongous), but Scarecrows is in the dark for the entire movie. Very often, it is difficult to understand what is really happening, and although some scarecrow shots were frightening, most were hard to see. If I had used a little more light, it might have been better. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, there are not many movies about deadly scarecrows, except Dark Night of the Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend this on Scarecrows every day.
