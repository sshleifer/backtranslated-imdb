Warner Bros. made many boilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, economical and very entertaining. I really like how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. It's one of the few Warner hardness melodramas that just does not work. Edward G. Robinson embodies a ruthless editor of a newspaper that revives the 20-year-old story of a murderer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a live performance but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad role of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the lead role really hurts the film. Starr is particularly bad during his big dramatic scene towards the end of the film. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of the Hollywood pre-code. LeRoy's management is full of innovative visual touches, but it can not overcome bad actions and unintentionally fun situations. The work of Sol Polito's camera is strong. In one way or another, this piece of dreck was nominated for an Oscar for best film (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
