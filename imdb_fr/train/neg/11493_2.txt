Störtebeker is really one of the worst TV miniseries ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is unbearable and the historical context is mostly absurd: two examples: Visby was presented as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a big city at that time, it's already the best of days gone by. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been the city taking care of the pirates of the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the main city of that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all that: the staging! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single credible scene, the fighting was ridiculous and I could not help laughing in the most severe scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not understand at all how much a big TV channel could be so incompetent.
