Anyone who might find a reductive value in this shit should have his head examined. We have the submissive woman subject to heroin addiction and part time, which has lacerations all over the body, lacerations resulting from repeated beatings by a violent son. Now she pours breast milk on the kitchen floor. This version has been learned so much that it looks like Helen Keller who put her hands in running water. We have the husband who begins to associate with a prostitute who happens to be his daughter (she is angry at him because he came too fast) and ends with the murder of his colleague, the sexual relations with his corpse, then the torn. We have the kid who is ruthlessly bullied by his classmates and comes home and beats his mother. You see, everything is circular. Deep, huh? The only propitious moment in this horrible heap of guts is when the father murders the executioners of his son. It's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise, what a waste of expensive film would be. If this guy who thinks the artists should be interested in this slop is really serious, it's no wonder most people think the artists are crazy. We saw this ugly film, then put on "Zero Woman, The Accused". Oh my God, it was to determine which was the worst. What is happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
