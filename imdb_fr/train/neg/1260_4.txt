Yes, CHUNKY is the nickname that the romantic song of Donna Reeds, played by Tom Drake, attributes to him! So let's see that right now. Since her first role as an ingenue in THE GET-AWAY (1941), her last role also, DALLAS (1984-1985), Mrs. Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim actress. Which roles in M.G.M. rarely live up to his talents. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Reed is supported by a cast of competent actors of character, who must unfortunately struggle in this so-called "ball comedy". Clearly M.G.M. was out of their depth doing this type of movie. A better type produced on COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the "touch" of Ernst Lubitsch nor the spirit of Preston Sturges could save this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that bore all the marks of a pre-war effort. <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg had always been alive, the scenario would have been reviewed or not. daylight. This was part of Louis B. Mayer's "safe zone", where no family entertainment was a challenge. A form that could not withstand the post-war challenges of the "DeHavilland decision", the loss of their theater channels, television and would contribute to the decline of Mr.G.M.s. Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are coming, culminating in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
