Everyone at one point, Disney makes one of those movies that surprises everyone. One that makes you wonder until the end. In the tradition of the Pirates of the Caribbean, this film will surely become a ghost, kill and violate your village. It's terrible. If you want a stupid, insane and predictable action movie, go for it. I believe that young children could enjoy it, as they love when the good always wins. But I like movies where you have to know who will win. This film never lets the bad guys take over. In the end, when the heroes are left in a "must" well, you KNOW they can go out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he never has to think about an enigma or a clue for more than 10 seconds, whatever its complexity. Watch this film if you want to see impressive sets, not if you want to see a good acting or a good movie. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like it more. For example, the scene where Cage is fleeing from the gunmen, and the bullets are all deflected by the ramp of an emergency exit. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, but ON ONE SIDE) This film shows the decadence of movies and the film industry as cheap gags and boring and unrealistic actions, that this film provides in huge quantities.
