My god, this movie is terribly boring. I am a big fan of Gina Gershon. When I rented this film, I was expecting a romantic drama and Gershon's excellent performance. Gershon is great, as always, but she's not the right actress for that role, she's too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzija is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated the character of Serbedzija (a winner organizer), it is by no means charming in the film. How Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) goes beyond my understanding. Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford might have done a better job on this role, but they do not look European, I suppose. In any case, I was so bored watching the movie. If you're looking for a good movie from Gina Gershon, check out Bound, her best movie so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so underrated and she deserves a better chance than that. I wish him better choices in the future.
