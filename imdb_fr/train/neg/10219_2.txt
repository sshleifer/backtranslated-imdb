Soldier Blue is a film with pretensions: pretensions to be a kind of profound declaration on the inhumanity of the man towards the man, on the exploitation and the brutality of the white man towards the autochthonous people; a biting, flawless and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but that is unfortunately not the case. What Soldier Blue is, in fact, is pernicious garbage, banal, badly made and dishonest. <br /> <br /> Another critic is absolutely right in saying that it was a hybrid of two completely different films. In fact, they are lame, clichéd and badly played "strange couples" - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the lifestyle of the other and falling in love (ah, blessed) - corrected by two disgusting massacres that would have not been revealed. of place in a splash film of Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the disgusting, prurient and gore climax, in which cute little Native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled and graphic close-up, and Native American women to wide breasts are molested, raped and tied up - no excuses, that is, except at the box office. (The massacre itself, although disgusting in its misplaced intention, is very poorly organized, a group of actors dragging with a bright red paint is stained on it, interspersed with some sequences with special effects of decapitation / dismemberment - dismemberment, incidentally Now, that's what I call exploitation.) <br /> <br /> Forget everything you've heard (including ridiculous comments that start and end in the movie) about the fact that this a "protest". ", an indictment of US brutality towards indigenous peoples This film does not speak of the plight of the Cheyenne, if that had been done, it would have involved some Native American characters and allowed us to get to know each other worry about the nameless, faceless innocents who were slaughtered at the climax, instead we get the silly novel by Bergen and Strauss (both unhealthy at least), with lots of blood, entrails and sliced ​​heads to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame, because there is a film to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real-life massacres in the United States (and the Great Britain, and all the so-called "civilized" nations) have participated over the centuries (Iraq?) This is simply not this movie.
