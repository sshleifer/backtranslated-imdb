The original book of this film was created in the 1950s, but that does not suit the television series, because most people look at the fashion of the 1930s. Ironically, the metro near the end was a train of 1950s painted to look like a train from the 1930s so that the subway could also play this game. Suspending the plot of a plot on the Jarrow March was weak, but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them. I suppose that making them think about the poverty of the protesters is pretty much the same thing. Everything about Japp's self-sufficiency was also weak, but something had to be done to fill the time. It would have been a decent half-hour show where they could have filmed the book and made a better feature film. It is obvious that this episode is victim of style rather than content.
