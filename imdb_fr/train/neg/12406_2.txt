The Treasure Island DVD should be viewed in all film production courses! This is a classic example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the film and listening to the writer / director's comments graphically shows the big gap between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience. Call me old-fashioned, but I think movies are a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the public does not know what the hell is the director talking about. The avowed goal of the director is to make a film empty of "Hollywood conventions". Unfortunately, these conventions include consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that the public often does not understand the points where he deliberately avoided a "Hollywood cliché". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are a shortcut for quickly and clearly conveying complex ideas. It's good to avoid them, but they have to be replaced by another way to communicate the same idea, not just eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich in potential. Two puppets are dedicated to the making of the personality and background of an unidentified corpse to be used in a misinformation mission during the last days of the Second World War. Soon, everyone begins to populate his personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes more and more real. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood Convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful movie with this idea. This film certainly is not! The puppets do everything in their power to bring coherence to these characters, but they are too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I am more and more impressed by Gonzo, who plays the animated corpse. In several muppet films, he still stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
