I do not want to make a speech here, but ..... it's the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than the Avengers. An incompetent leadership, a disjointed writing and a terrible game are the only coherent elements. Shot on video very cheap, it looks like a high school project, but without emotion. The lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a microphone on the camera, but everything else is horrible. The plot unfolds in strange directions, without foundation or subsequent resolution, the technical elements are obviously absurd and editing seems worse than a simple cut. It's not even serious enough to be funny. It's just bad. BTW, the packaging is intentionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
