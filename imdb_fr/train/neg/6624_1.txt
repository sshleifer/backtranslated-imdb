This movie was absolutely ... well I can not find the word oh wait ... shit! I mean when it started, I was like yeah that looks good and after that it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and it has nothing to do with the fact that I caught a late projection because it was a total filth. Ram Gopal Varma did his best, but the cast could never match the original Sholay. I wanted to say what was he thinking about doing a remake? What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year as he did for Black? Ajay and this other guy were good, especially the guy who played the raj because he was one of those to watch. What was Amitabh doing? He destroys his own dignity by making all these stupid movies. First Nishabd, then Cheeni Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now, I mean he has to get some of his money back and get as far as possible from Bollywood before he loses all his respect and I will say he's already gone by half. I mean, all of this is really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who is now a very good name because of the recent fall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and I just knew that Abhishek was going to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend money, go watch Heyy Babyy because it's the funniest movie of all time and it's number one in charts!
