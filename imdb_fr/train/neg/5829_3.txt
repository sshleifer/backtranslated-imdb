I watched this film as a preview of an art exhibition by Matthew Barney. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibit and, in retrospect, I should probably have it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good score (Bjork) and the rich and colorful photography, the content was generally tedious and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone wear pearls to understand what pearl divers were preparing. The film was mainly a stupid mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial plans of modern whaling technology used in a hunting / harvesting simulation. The film "culminates" with enough shock-free art to turn your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the film? While others might argue that this is an anti-hunt argument, it could also be said that it also justifies whaling in some way. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "sparkle" the public with his anal, fecal, self-mutilation and cannibal fetishes. No need to watch this movie. The message is obscure, the pace is slow and the cultural references pretentious. If you like shocking art, you'll do better at one of the many "Undead" movies or looking for an old copy of Hustler and catching a cartoon.
