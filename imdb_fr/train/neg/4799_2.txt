I myself am a big fan of the 1980s low budget horror movies. It's not the worst but not too spectacular. The line of the plot is decent but lags far too long. You finish half of the movie before you even see a zombie action. The victims are not very creative and the zombies are not too smart. I really think this movie would have been better if they had left out the zombies and made it a mafia movie. It's watchable, but I feel that this movie stole me at least an hour of my life. I will give the film the merit of being a little original. If you really like horror B movies, it's worth watching, but if it's not the case, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for it.
