I'm really beginning to believe that Seagal's mission is to see how badly his films could become. This film in particular was a total waste of time to see. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they tampered with his picture. and made him look slimmer and younger when in the movie he looks like shit. He has his big flat stomach and his double chin for him and the most miserable and boring look on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous at first and was way too long. The film as a whole led to the final where Seagal and his team had to face a group of people under the influence of a chemical and top secret adrenaline activator. unnecessary dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals' voice even in the middle of a statement. The doubled voice looked like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> fight scenes in the movie were horrible.Malf the time Seagal foug We could not even see what was happening. He would have tight pictures of him beating his arms towards the camera, then the person crossing a wall or something. It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. too slow for combat scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it's the worst Seagals movie to date and I'm glad I did not buy this movie. Otherwise, I would have been very upset because I'm a big fan of Seagal, the aikidist. The action star disappears quickly and seems to worsen at each performance.
