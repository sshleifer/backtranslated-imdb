Bad acting, no scenario, no scenario, no convincing murderer, no suspense, no original configuration, he uses the same closet / under the bed / the person behind the mirror, again and again, making it repetitive boring, and NOT in a prefiguring way either, and the fact that NONE is never "really" killed (at least not on the screen), which cancels any suspense that he can invoke and makes everyone feel even more deceived to spend money on their admission ticket .... it's a horror movie without any horror LMAO. The BEST you see is what looks like someone who took a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it on a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You must be a teenager sitting, screaming at the theater and fearing to have enjoyed This, or you were intoxicated at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and do not bother to write reviews unless I really hate something or like it a lot. <br /> <br /> But this film is AWFUL and I feel that I have a duty to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage that kind of shoot again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to hire a "bad" blockbuster movie from the Weinsteins, it's another matter when you have to sit in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, if you want remake of nostalgia, forget it! This is not a remake nor a re-imagine. It's not scary, attractive, or satisfying enough to be "funny" as others have claimed on IMDb ... it's just reassuring and crazy. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll remember about this movie: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST have a sexual affair with JS Cardone's "The Forsaken" had another role of assassin (because he is as scary as my poodle and too cute to kill anyone) and for some reason (duh) all those who return as a result of the hotel is coming back. What kind of person would not care about prom when they decided to announce the candidates to the king and queen prom and the extremely competitive girl does not show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste your money as I did. The "original" is also bad, but it is rather a guilty pleasure for the fans of Jamie Lee Curtis, even if it is not as serious as this piece of shit (sorry to appear vulgar or coarse, but once you see that, you will understand why I say what I say).
