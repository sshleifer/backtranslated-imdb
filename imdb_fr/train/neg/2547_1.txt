I have not seen him for more than twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo looked very much at home like the bad guy, a natural. I think I mostly watched it at the time for OJ, who had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little annoyed that Johnson was so serious. <BR /> <br /> And yes, that moved the parcels. Reading other articles, I remember it was a plot that they wanted to kidnap a rich girl, but the priceless business of the stamp market appeared as if by magic. <br /> <br /> I was going, a stamp? If the movie came at the end, I would probably record it to check it again, but I would not be nostalgic for the movie. Not yet. <br /> <br /> There are better movies of the seventies like this one to discover.
