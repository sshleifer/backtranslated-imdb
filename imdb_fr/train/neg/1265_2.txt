I did not want to watch this movie first, because the trailer sounded like a common and overdue movie ... but as I recently had the pleasure of discovering the amazing "Lies and Betrayals" and more if affinity "" beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (scriptwriter of "lend me your hand"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "lend me your hand" was also worth Although "lies ..." And this is not the case The scenario is not bad, but it is not as well directed as "Lies ...", the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually is) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac And also, honestly, I still do not understand how such shit can be so successful, even with such a cast ... Whatever however, the story could have been used as a pretext to create as many interesting topics, but it is not so good as "Lies ..." of Tirard, even if he also wrote it. Easy work, unsurprising and lazy. Totally overestimated!
