This movie is just bad. Weak history, weak leadership and below-average role play. What really pissed me off was the blatant advertising - permanently - for a well-known Internet service provider. It is obvious that some scenes are written to do exactly that, advertising. This film is a slap for all those who pay for it. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, it's not worth it.
