This movie lost me with the RPG (rocket propelled grenade) crossbow. It was as if someone had cut and pasted a Robocop scene. I was almost expecting Beowulf to exclaim, "I love him!" <br /> <br /> I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV show "The Dead Zone" and he played his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it for the entire movie - unlike any of his teammates. They continued to slip into all sorts of speeches, from Old English to Modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source document. However, even in itself, the plot of this movie is not good. It's just boring, that even the small budget does not excuse. Having a small budget means that you must at least have a good history, dialogue and decent actions. These things are cheap. Instead, they spent their money on computer graphics, costumes, and decent sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
