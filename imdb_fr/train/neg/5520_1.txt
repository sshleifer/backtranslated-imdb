This film was featured in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick. I hated. I think if they want to make a film like this, they should be human enough to reflect the movie's true intentions in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I had known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I'm fed up. I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It's been several days now and I still have a bad taste in the mouth of this movie. I have never been so disappointed by a film, nor ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that this trailer is a real deception, because if they showed the true intention of the film, nobody would have seen it.
