Flee this movie. Even the standard B-movie, this film is terrible. He is also insidious in his theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and respect nothing are cool and worthy of admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a film that speaks for the poor much better than this film, see it. <br /> <br /> No normal child would do what Trent does. State Troopers does not work like in this movie, etc. Seeing this movie, you understand why the authors use the clich√© hooker-with-a-heart-d'or. Mija is a completely unfriendly prostitute who, yes, had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the public can not relate to her. <br /> <br /> It is generally recommended to recommend a movie. It's such a ridiculous film that it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate according to B-movie standards and the production does not present anything new or interesting.
