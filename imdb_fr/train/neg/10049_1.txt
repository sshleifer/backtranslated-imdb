I like the series "Masters of Horror", often badly named. Horror fans live in a constant lack of food. Projects like this (and the similar project "Greenlight Project" with "Feast") are fertile ground for creating wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of filmmakers who have the horror of developing and nurturing children I love to dine on horror. <br /> <br /> This one started with a really-kool-idea kernel and ran ... just on the verge of "where am I going with that? !!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to ruin the spoiled but "SPOILER AHEAD" All of a sudden ... no, there was this light that drifted through the night sky earlier ... we have long Des Luminescent extraterrestrials to the hair (huh? ... HUH?) that is boring their brains and ... yeah, I understand, but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a catchy and promising setup with no rewarding outcome. </ b> <br /> Remember the storytellers ... your set up should generate a gain that exceeds the accumulation. Not the opposite. Mathematics of Tale 101. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
