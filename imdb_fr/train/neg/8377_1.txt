This is exactly why many people remain homeless. . . because stupid producers pay their money to make terrible movies like this one instead of making a donation if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white girls! Little Man has a lame excuse to pose a character as a baby. The story is horrendous, considering that it was written by six people. The idea would still not be too bad though, if it was original and was not the scam of a cartoon episode. there are fun times but some are too complicated and others just stupid. The acting was really bad. So was the staging. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of itself. it's racist and very offensive to the dwarves. I mean, instead of showing them sympathy, the filmmakers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see dwarves looking like babies. And for a character who is a dwarf, claiming to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. It's his lame excuse to show something like that. It just was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
