Nick Millard, aka Nick Phillips should have stayed pretty alone when he made "Criminally Insane" 10 years before the publication of this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" lasted less than an hour should have made him understand that he had probably exploited this scenario for everything he was going to get out of ... sequences of the original in this one. Also, to the point of recycling the initial opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, bringing back the old and fast Priscilla Alden did not save this one. What a little piece of original film that was in this movie, it looks like it was filmed with a camcorder held in hand rented! If this film cost more than 100 dollars, I would be very surprised and I would be just as surprised that it produces a result close to this amount! Avoid this one and look at the original instead!
