I finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago..WoW, I still can not believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie of all time. If I list all the flaws of the film, this criticism would take a lot of sentences. (Very funny faults, because they are so bad) <br /> <br /> We must be impressed by the talent of the commandos assigned to the rescue of the plane. they did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and what I do not understand is that the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he is of course an asset. . <br /> <br /> Of course, the main fault will be the landing of a 747, it will need only 3 or 4 tricks from a guy in transmission to land on the plane ... amazing .. as well as dead bodies that had almost no blood at all .. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend watching this movie because it's very interesting to see how much something can go wrong
