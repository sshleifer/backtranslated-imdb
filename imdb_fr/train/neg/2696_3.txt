I know that John Singleton is a clever guy because he created Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and realize that? It's like the pilot of a bad "first-time teenager" in college, a parade of boring stereotypes and clich√©s with gratuitous violence to make a commercial proposition, I suppose. Who could have guessed that the victim of rape would have thrown sausages for seafood? A group of neo-Nazis would attack this lonely angry (and end up with a Jew and a Jew - just to laugh!) Even the scary story teacher Laurence Fishburne irritated me and I love this guy like everyone involved in this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.
