It's an extremely boring movie. If you grew up during Vietnam Was, as I did, then you have seen and heard all the movie sequences and all the arguments here a hundred times. But what really makes this movie boring is the narrative of director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood speaking directly to the camera about his opinion of this conflictual period in the history of our country. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, you will not find anything new here, no new evidence condemning John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary about The youngest viewers interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a job for John Kerry, but he failed miserably for that purpose.
