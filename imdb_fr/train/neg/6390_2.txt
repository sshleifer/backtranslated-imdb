I saw about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite type) This film is among the worst. For me, an idea leads a movie. So even a badly played and cheap movie can be good. Something weird is definitely made cheaply. However, he has little to say. I still do not understand what the early karate scene has to do with the movie. Something weird has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
