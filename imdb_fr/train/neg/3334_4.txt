It scared me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than terrifying, but with rather disturbing moments and with a kind of fishy quality that I like. And, to think about it, the plot is rather disgusting ... but managed with a kind of taste. If there is a problem with this film, it's because there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting is happening. In addition, the end lasts indefinitely, making a potentially tense climax that seems silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster", once exposed, is unfortunately not very scary either. The dull look of the film also goes against this one, making it appear as a TV movie rather than a movie for theaters. But this is an example of movies that are rarely made today, so I encourage horror fans to look at it and feel a little nostalgic ...
