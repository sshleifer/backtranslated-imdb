As a longtime fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found this episode disappointing and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" featuring Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and in largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and the death of a crew member) was a money-saving device, as were many of their "bottle shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place in the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this one for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. The faithful viewers (in the world of Star Trek, is there another?) Were also traded. It was the last episode of the second season; thus, the season ended "not with a bang" but with "a groan".
