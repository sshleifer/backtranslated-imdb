I just rented (yes, I paid money to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer, Ms. Colagrande, said, take out movies, PLEASE! Please never do or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, it's not fair for cantaloupe, which probably has more. She does not know how to act; it affects a disgusted look ALL the time (reminded me a lot of my sisters-in-law always disgusted with Europe). She is not charming; she is not pretty There is no real story. And the editing! There was none, that I could see! It's a real shame when you watch a movie and, just to get through, you press "Forward Forward" on your remote, and STILL nothing happens! I want to say! ..... I continued to shout involuntarily: "Cut! Cut!" What were they thinking? Of course, they thought to make a movie together and get paid to make love on the screen! Very good deal for them. nice raw deal for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw up now ...
