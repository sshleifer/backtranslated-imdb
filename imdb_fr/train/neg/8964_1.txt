Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube films know about what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in a pile of booby traps, paranoia, bad action games ... This one is however a little different. About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we watch the audience (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I guess Cube Zero aspires to explain what The Cube is, but you really do not know more than what was covered in the first two movies. Of course, there is some kind of explanation there, but it is rather ridiculous compared to what was suggested in the first film. <br /> <br /> Zero cube seems rather cheap (just like its predecessors), and the fact shows more than a few empty rooms only highlights this feeling. I am also confident enough that there is no risk that either of the players will win a prize in the foreseeable future. However, they brought back the traps of the cube 1 (I mean that they are almost the same, which is a shame). <br /> <br /> I know a lot of people I really appreciate this movie and its connection to the first one, but I think it's a totally useless contribution to a franchise that was not not terrible at first.
