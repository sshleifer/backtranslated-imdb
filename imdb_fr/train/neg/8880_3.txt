This movie was o.k. but it could have been a lot better. There are some phantasmagorical moments but they are not enough to make me want to see this movie again. There are scenes in which you can fast forward and not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it's so predictable, and that's why I've rated it so low. It is observable but do not expect much.
