I commented on this fact when he debuted for the first time and gave him a review of the "thumbs in the middle" type, noting that I would give him the benefit of doubt beyond the first episode. To date, I have watched six episodes in total in June 2006. And, Batman's longtime fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this series is a shit. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with her. All. Turning just to lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously complicated and without character development or apparent interest on the part of the authors of this dreck to give any substance to any stories. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake ... is it just me, or is the Joker in every episode? Is Gotham a revolving door justice system? Or is it a total disinterest of writers to try to interest other villains (see "Character Development" above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, each Joker narrates it is the same formula in 3 parts. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker puts people on gas. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker begins to gas the whole city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode in which I saw that it was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was this evil Cluemaster ... the episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the quiz show. It was the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard, or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement". <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I think about this show because it is probably against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardisation". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. bat era, back from the days Fox and Kids WB. It's so good, and I should have known, I could not have lasted forever, unfortunately.
