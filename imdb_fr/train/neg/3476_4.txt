I liked it, I really did. Please do not think I'm an idiot, but I must admit that I enjoyed this movie. I was expecting it to be shit, it was shit, but sometimes it's OK to relax and watch a shitty movie that you do not have to focus on do not you? I did not expect any hidden meaning or moral sense, and there was none, but it did not matter, I only watched it for entertainment, and it made me always entertained. Movies like this are why the Ben Stillers (excusing "there's something about Mary") and the Vince Vaughns (regardless of the last name I spelled, I do not have been disturbed to check) have jobs. It's good to watch a crappy movie as long as you do not expect too much, and I have to take a stand, jog, maybe run, but not drive because I do not have a car, at Blockbuster Video, or even Choices, and rent a bunch of these humorous movies on the toilet and spend the night watching them. Good day to you reader. P.s if you do not say that this comment helped you so I do not love you, if you say it helped you while God bless you, you will go to heaven.
