When I saw this in a store, I found it really beautiful and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets the chainsaw massacre in Texas, and I mean it only costs three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it was worth it. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the administrators - the "Boucher brothers" could not decide if they wanted to do some kind of artistic horror or a bloody horror slasher. This resulted in an hour and fifteen minutes of bloody and bloody clich√©s with all the characters being one-dimensional and we did not care what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters, they added a useless monologue to the end and the beginning of the film which, to be perfectly honest, was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is really the middle / the end, I will not spoil it. But it was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Overall, a useless watch. It looked like a two-hour movie but only lasted 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, do not worry. If you want a slasher movie, do not bother, the movie moves so slowly without anything happening.
