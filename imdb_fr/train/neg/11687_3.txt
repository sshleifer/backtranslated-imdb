Deception causing a yawn and a snail, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation because of his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and the hostages are held against their will by a brain thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is responsible for compelling the thief to surrender himself. his only blow to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intentions of her own, sent to retrieve an item from the safe of the bank owner who is stored in the bank, and you end up with a dilemma to three. Unfortunately, everything is set up in the movie and nothing brings in at the end. Denzel Washington is at his best interest-free in an inefficient and egocentric performance with disgust. The only grace that saves the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, far better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most surprising and high-caliber performance by playing against type as a relentless and ruthless villain. Clive Owen does not have much to do besides hatching and posing, but the depth of his presence and his acting abilities have largely outweighed his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted in this film without impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee thought when creating this movie. The most disturbing aspect of Inside Man, however, lies in the unjustified praise he has received. For a film that seemed to have all the ingredients of a blockbuster before the summer, it falls flat.
