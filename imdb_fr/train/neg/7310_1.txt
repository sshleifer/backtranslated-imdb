** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is my best film for the movie of the year ... that I have already seen. This movie is straight There are so many problems with the movie that you can not help but be amazed. This film had so much potential to be good, but finally did not do it. The characters were as stupid as possible. for the whole movie, you're just wondering "why would you do that?" or "what is your purpose in doing this?" ... it's just how illogical and stupid the characters are. We do not receive ANY background, so naturally you do not give a rat a story of his destiny ... you can only laugh at his stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The "slut" (Marcy), for example ... was she so excited that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? It was useless. It's almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give him the virus, so you're done! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would anyone really want to go into the woods and drink tap water from a booth WITHOUT looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert just shoot the patient from the beginning? The film would have been finished that way .... by the way, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk it? 'No, I'll wait until 2 of my friends get infected (one to two steps from death) to finally choose to get out of here. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the reasoning behind Paul's fishing attempt out of the Hermit's body, to fall into the tainted reservoir and become infected with the virus? STUPIDITY pure! <br /> <br /> I swear that common sense was not a friend, let alone a knowledge of these idiots. I do not think the end of a movie was worse. At the beginning, the children asked the cashier of the shop like "what was the rifle", and he answered that "it is for the negroes". At the end of the film, 3 young black people (dressed in loose clothes, one of them dressed like a cloth) enter the store ... come to discover that the cashier was cleaning it to be able to use them for the hunt. THEN he gives them all the weight and handshakes and jokes with them as if they were his boys at home. <br /> <br /> OK, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT ?! Like what taste can we have, what did filmmakers think to put that in the movie? As a black man, of course I was offended by the initial comment "Nigger". It was an insipid and useless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the purpose of the end with black children? Did that make me forget the initial racist comment made earlier? To arrange things with black viewers, making a joke? For my part, I did NOT find this pathetic attempt to humor fun. The whole movie was a joke ... a PATHETIC shooting attempt that should not be given on time. Peter Jackson really thought this movie was so good? What movie was he watching? <br /> <br /> ZERO * on **** stars .... if I could give it a lower note, I would. Please, dear IMDb friends, do not waste an hour and a half of your precious life watching this abomination of a "movie". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
