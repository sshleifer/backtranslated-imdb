The film had a beautiful opening, I really thought I was in one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while ... there was something "alien" in the way the movie was mounted, realistic but somewhat abstract and mystical. But then, the scenario began to become less and less realistic. To say that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement ... The most typical romantic ending where everything goes well for all the "nice" characters. A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and pursues the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love to a crowd of friendly spectators. Come on. In the end, the "good" win, the "bad guys" lose ... You get the picture. A WASTE of a potentially interesting film.
