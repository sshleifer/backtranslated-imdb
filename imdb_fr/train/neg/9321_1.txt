I rented this movie about 4 or 5 years ago and was instantly disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a slasher movie, but I ended up with fecal matter for the eyes. The game was similar to watching the dry grass. I saw better play in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere leaves me perplexed. How was it a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was at best laughable. There was no fear. It was as if a high school student had received a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if existent. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better B movies there.
