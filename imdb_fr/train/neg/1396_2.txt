This film about the experiences of the secret government's mind and the corrupt use of citizens by secret and vile characters could be a really interesting film. But for me, it failed. I will not dwell much on the plot that is confusing, but if you search a detailed explanation, the comment of the user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description. <br /> <br /> But that's not the case. work for me. I thought it was slow, which would be nice without the fact that it seemed to be going nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark about too many things to truly understand this movie. Some films can say as much as the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. I do not think that's the case here. <br /> <br /> Regarding the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users ... I see they have a point - they give the viewer time to take a another glass without forgetting anything about "the action". And I suspect that many viewers would like to have the opportunity to have several drinks on board to get through this one.
