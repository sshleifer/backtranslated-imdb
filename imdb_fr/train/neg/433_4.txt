This film is predictable. it's more predictable than Vinnie Testaverdi's pass when he plays the ball for the Jets. We saw the end come midway through the film. Politics reminds me of my return to the east. Many people know when the fix has arrived. I gave these four questions because of the acting, but the story is lame.
