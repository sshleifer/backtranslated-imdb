It was yet another big-screen release for a 60s American TV show. It's pretty fun but it was really a lot to the formula. Intelligent Martian landed on Earth and met, in his opinion, not too bright humans. <br /> <br /> The usual delirium ensues with the human, Bridges, eventually bonding with him and helping him get home. Along the way, he also receives the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice outing for some nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Enough to pass. free time if you have nothing better to see.
