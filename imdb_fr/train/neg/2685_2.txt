I have never screened a movie online, but I felt compelled to do so after seeing this one. One does not show up for someone's funeral and does not say to the bereaved, "My parents are dead, so why should I care about yours?" <br /> <br /> Less propaganda, be called "art". As a daughter of deaf parents, the use of deafness as a gadget particularly bothered me. Any deaf person feeling a vibration of this immensity would probably have investigated and would not have ignored it. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are few topics I would like to avoid: the holocaust is one; it's another. I hope these filmmakers have not been so arrogant (and incompetent).
