I do not really like the work of Sean Penn, and this first film, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no heart, it is colored with a kind of bitter anti-authoritarian who, in all honesty, defiles most of Penn's work, his last work even more than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, all this seems to produce such a fundamentally mundane product, apparently in allegiance to honesty, but which ends up being for the most part glorified by professional wrestling matches if Hallmark cards had developed a line of greetings from the Hell's Angels, and made me dream for the day of Deliverance, which is a good movie The game of Viggo Mortensen is much, much more credible here than this ridiculous thing he did with Cronenberg, and is almost everything. The film has no meaning and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Congratulations to Charles Bronson, however, who proves that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's character. A ugly 3 out of 10 for this shit The Indian Runner.
