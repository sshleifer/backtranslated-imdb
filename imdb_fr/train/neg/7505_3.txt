This long film does not deal with Berkowitz and its effect on New York, but more with the painting of caricatures of a certain group of Italo-Americans, locally nicknamed "Guidos". The problem is that the "Guidos" are irrelevant, regardless of the type of story or the scenery in which they are immersed. They are already living cartoons. Lee is only amplifying them, rather than describing them. <br /> <br /> When someone caricatures themselves, he does not go home and does not say, "Hey, make your ears and nose bigger!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. Complete it with an uninteresting scenario for the characters, especially that of John Leguizamo, and you'll get a nice movie to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Another hit: for someone who proclaims himself a fan of the Yankees and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is misspelled in the closing credits.
