Anyway, it's an amateur film, an exhibitionist - or an effort at a time - that's as interesting and audacious as the composition book of a shattering high school student, full of " poetry "of death. While this will bother viewers prone to being disturbed, the success will be attributed to themselves, not to the director. Putting yourself under the skin of someone requires sensitivity, discipline, technique, talent, as well as the eye and the ear. The film contains an evocative image, shown as a still image (and also used in the video box), but no development has preceded or distanced it. If the director had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - that is, a movie.
