I went to get this movie thinking he had good ratings. First of all, it's ridiculous that they released a film originally shot in 2001, seven years later in 2008, here in India. Everything in the movie seems dated. Even in 2001, the film seems to have been created with a budget of shoe ropes. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to explain how you can get a budget. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during this scene, I missed it because I slept in my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a heck. She wears mismatched clothes and frowns randomly at the children. As for Alec Baldwin, do not miss a scene where he meets Webster for the first time. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said: "Go home and write better!"
