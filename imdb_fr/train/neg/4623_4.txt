If you have not seen the TV series gong show yet, then you will not really like this movie, knowing that the series makes it an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10 because some things make it fun, which helps to compensate for its obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) This is a funny snapshot of the time it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos of people you saw in the series. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he does not make his personality on TV. 4) You can see a lot of weird people doing all kinds of strange things, as you see in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because they are numerous, but here are some of the most important ones. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show movie contains many excerpts from TV shows that are tired by the length of the movie. 2) The story line of the movie outside the segments of the clip is very small and consists essentially of a single plot point. 3) Chuck is actually pretty decent as an actor, but most of the other actors have a typical behavior on the flatness of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you do not have an hour and a half, you want to watch all at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. But even then, it's not so good either. ;)
