Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simply referring to movies, as Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The film begins quite well with a scene of strikes with whites fun and excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The film collapses unfortunately from there. The game is terrible. Tori Spelling seems and acts completely irrelevant. The film looks hacked and its pace is surprisingly slow. Some of the longest gags in this sneak-paced movie, involving joints and a Tom Cruise movie already mentioned, were funny to no one in my theater. Fortunately, the film stops abruptly in the 83rd minute in a shocking end. (I say shocking because the end does not even try to end humorously) I do not know what to say except that it's a sloppy sequel to make Miramax a little more money on the backs of stupid teens . Overall, a movie very badly done.
