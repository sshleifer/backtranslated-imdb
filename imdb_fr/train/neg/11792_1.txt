This film must be the cheapest of the 21st century. It is of mediocre quality, but in the end, it falls below ... everything. All the cheap stuff - like blinking and darkness - are used to hide these shitty computer effects. All actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne is asked: "Why do you look so careless?" The correct answer is because it can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid smile on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the movie that's B-quality. This is also the description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray-vessel, Capital-vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description looks like a different movie, featuring a character called Fletcher and sea monsters.
