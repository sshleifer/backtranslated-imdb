Hello, I come from Denmark and one day, I had a movie night with my friends. We brought this film with him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely horrible. After watching for less than half a minute, we decided to make a quick lead by stopping at laughable "highlights" or should I say "weak points" in the film. In fact, I was especially surprised to discover that this film was produced here, in my country, Denmark ... it must be the biggest mistake of this country.
