Frank Tashlin's "The Home Front" is one of Snafu's lifeless private shorts, a series of cartoons made as educational films for the military. Rather than allowing Snafu to take unintended steps leading to disaster, "The Home Front" focuses on his loved ones back home and all they have to offer for the war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. This is a concept that offers few opportunities to make good gags and Tashlin plays the risky card louder, long jokes involving strippers and lightly dressed dancers instead of a very effective comic relief. The result is a well-intentioned short film that has little significance or entertainment value today other than a historical artifact.
