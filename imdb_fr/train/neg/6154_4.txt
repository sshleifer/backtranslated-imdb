A nice guy falls in love with a luscious blonde; she likes him too, but not for reasons you might think. Pat Proft's little-known black comedy features some very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, without having a lasting impact. It's just a quick effort, led by Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedies, "eating Raoul", a bit similar, is a better bet. There is certainly a fun setup here; unfortunately, the photo has nowhere to go in its second act. An interesting test, but one that fails. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
