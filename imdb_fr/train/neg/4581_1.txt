Pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new age. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the subatomic world, it is impossible to predict with certainty the location of a particle at a given moment. You can only give the chance to be exactly one place at a time. In addition, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through the barriers. So far, all this is correct. But then they say it means that if you honestly believe that you can cross a wall, you can do it. It's complete poppycock. Instead, the theory says that at our level, you can cross a wall, but it's just by chance and it has nothing to do with a belief. Also, you should continue walking in the wall for eternity to have the slightest chance of getting through the wall, chances are so astronomical as it is. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how they denature science. But the story involving an unfortunate photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan, is much more annoying. In the middle of the image, the confusion is such that it is incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hatred. There may be something real about it, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is the most popular novelty in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this moron, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA on PBS that presents a history of Newton's physics and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours episodes. Quantum mechanics is very well explained if you want to know it without the fog of a metaphysical appropriation.
