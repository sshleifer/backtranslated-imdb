In one way or another, they summarized the sixties, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivialized the main events and events and they "claimed" that they were two families, but you hardly saw the African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed to spread such garbage. What was amusing was that this merry family you saw at the beginning was tortured in many ways, but managed to attend all the big events of the 60's across the country. And the second family was such a factor. They may have spent five or six scenes in total on this family. This poor son ... Please NBC, do not make movies on other times .... leave this to PBS and History Channel
