I read articles about this movie somewhere on the Internet and many have criticized the fact that this film is bad and nil. And I could not have agreed more on that. Then, after seeing this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it, then the advertisement of this film on television. Fortunately, I saved my money for those pieces of shit. I had sacrificed my sleep for this movie and it soon turned out that this movie could not satisfy me. So I can not judge how the film was shot, but still ... it still sucks. For those who liked this film, I would like to apologize for setting it on fire and explaining how bad this film is. I do not know what you think about this movie
