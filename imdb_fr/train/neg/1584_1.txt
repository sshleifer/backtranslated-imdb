I read the man who ran in Kings books like Bachman and I felt good for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been so much more. The problem? It was during the great madness of the action movie. I watched the movie and felt pain during the whole process. I did not feel anything for the character and less for his cause. Yes, there were funny (or laughable) scenes, although I think it did not save the movie for me. If you read the book, you will feel the climax and fire in John's heart as he takes his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this film a low figure. It might not have been so low if I had not read the book.
