A murderous and cannibal rapist is killed by a mad policeman at the scene of his latest murder. On his grave, a cult met with the intention of resurrecting it by peeing on the grave. Of course, it works and he wakes up ripping off the guys penis and he finds his old ways of killing with a brand new zombie look. The two policemen who are a little crazy about the scum of the city and have a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original sect members are also trying to stop the killer by resurrecting another type of dead thing. Thinking that they have classified, they leave, but come out of the grave a plastic baby used during the original resurrection. It sounds a bit confusing, but not that it's hogwash. <br /> <br /> The acting game is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the gore series and he's as terrible as the boring cop in this movie. The other policeman is fighting to get out his terrible aftershocks. Now, I'm all for low budget cinema but this movie is terrible. If the ladies and their nudity were not very easy to look at, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of composure but it is never more than animal casings placed on the belly of the victims. The zombie makeup, for its part, looks great and the long penis of his foot that he uses to rape his victims is quite funny at times. There is also a half-decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the voice of the chipmunks is the most stupid thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to fight a lot more than him. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
