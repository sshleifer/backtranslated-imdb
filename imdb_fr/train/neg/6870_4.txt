A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), wife of devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. The brother of Mendel Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees it and hires her to work in the field where she is already an expert in jewelery. He also begins an affair with her, and when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he drops it and betrays it for the family, which blocks it. There is a secondary plot in which Sonja's deceased brother speaks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but the reason is unclear. Unfortunately, many things are not clear, including what is happening with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe that there is a fire in her and maybe not of God, and what that means, and what the beggar woman tells him. To a certain extent, the story addresses the fate of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly released. The notion of redemption by the love of a man of another race is also not well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman - and yet it is the bastard Sender who quotes it to Sonja. Zellweger fights with the role; she is supposed to be a West-Central Jewess, and sometimes her accent is accentuated, and at other times, she resumes the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is tough and she takes things in hand, but ultimately the film is messy.
