The most embarrassing moment of this film is when Brady Corbet said "You have bloomed" towards the end of the film. I'm practically dead. I still do not understand why the writers have put this line. Was he supposed to create a romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do the same. This film does not do it. If he had not had the big Thunderbirds branding card, he would have gone straight to television or canned in post-production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits end and they play Busted's song "Thunderbirds are go". I can not believe I lost $ 7 by watching this through pay-per-view.
