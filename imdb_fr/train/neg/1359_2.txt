A good cast is dreadfully wasted in this comedy slower than molasses and at random. Peter Ustinov does his best to bring something to life, but the result is a hard boredom that lacks all the good rhythms that could have made it visible. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is awful. Misdirected. Badly edited. Badly acted. Badly written. You have to watch a hundred movies to find one so bad. <br /> <br /> The confused and horrendously delayed plot is about Ustinov, who is making his way to an American insurance company to hack his computer and hijack millions of pounds. It goes beyond lameness and credibility (apparently acquiring computer skills overnight by reading pamphlets and having computer expert Robert Morley travel to South America and steal his identity ). <br /> <br /> conspiracy side, Ustinov romance his lonely compatriot Maggie Smith, who happens to become his secretary by chance after he had an apartment in his building. She ends up sharing sex scenes with Bob Newhart who are not going anywhere, while Ustinov tackles money and tries to stay one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has become the centerpiece of almost every British caper comedy since (Nuns on the Run? A fish named Wanda?) <br /> The surprise turn of a denouement is more laughable than anything that preceded. In the end, I thought I had to be really out of my rocker to hold on like that. Even a CÃ©sar Romero cameo did not help him. One of the funniest and least rhythmic "comedies" I have ever seen, and certainly the worst of the capers. Do not waste your time. If you like that, you have to see better movies.
