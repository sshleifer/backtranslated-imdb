Unless you are an evangelical Christian, do as an Egyptian and avoid as a biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Horrible - why oh why does IMDb list the most favorable reviews at the top of the list? that I just spoiled the end of what started as a good evening on this claprap. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot started strong enough - I was drawn into the film and I was interested in the purpose where sermons from the Bible resumed. Such a waste. <br /> <br /> I was so angry with this movie that I signed up for IMDb for the first time to complain - I hope at least that by doing that I'm saving someone's night out 'other. <Br /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act from me ;-)
