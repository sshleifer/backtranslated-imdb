** Spoilers possible ** <br /> <br /> This direct mess combines an overflowing heroine with weapons, Z-rated effects, Nazis, a mummy and countless lesbian scenes, and it's always boring; The video only lasts 45 minutes and looks like Eternity. The only good thing is one of the blooper jokes: the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist to sit on a chair - and a villain's foot is almost crushed under the chair's leg. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch golf, bowling or tennis on TV instead.
