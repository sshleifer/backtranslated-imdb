Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was good in Goldeneye and made a very good bad Bond in The Living Daylights and appeared in various other films. One of the things he can not do is take a film at the head of the film, which he does in this very bad revenge film in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so he kills the killer's brother and the escort in Italy, but some make him pose in Malta and the killer flees. The rest of the film sees Joe Don chasing the murderer here and there, Joe Don being arrested several times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted, etc. The film is pretty bad and you will not find exactly to shoot for Joe Don's character. You'll be surprised how many times Joe Don, the hero, is punched and incompetent. The film's coronation occurs when Joe Don pursues the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest's robe, then they board boats and he chases them all around Malta. This film also features one of the worst lines of closing a movie.
