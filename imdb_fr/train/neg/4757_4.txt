Some time ago I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors, Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he is now the husband and Jude Law in love with his wife. The story is always the same and it's a fantastic piece. <br /> <br /> During the film, I always had the feeling of watching a play. This is one of the reasons why I do not like this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted to a play, I must still feel to see a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan has done wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed it. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern, elegant, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never felt that anyone had ever lived in this house. The photography was not bad, but the lightning was awful. Sometimes there was a blue light, a black and green light, to surround him not very pleasing to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The acting game was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law are at their best. I would really like to see these 2 guys play together on stage. But I must admit that I have never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the central part. I remember that in the original, this part was still very mysterious and just wonderful. I tried to watch him twice and always in the middle part, I fell asleep. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more a film for critics than for the public. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
