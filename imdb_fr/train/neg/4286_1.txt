It's about the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot, because I also saw Soldier, in which he plays the bad guy ... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a film by Jason Scott Lee. This, however, is. And if that indicates the quality of such films, I will not see them. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist ... as a leader, he is awful. He struggles with random nameless characters every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter can not find a way to lengthen the film to the minimum required for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he is certainly crazy, he seems hardly like a villain. The majority of the film is essentially Lee chasing the bad guy through time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I certainly would not look for it. The effects are not completely horrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. One way or another, the movie messes up this interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pace is poor. I can not think of a positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can not. It's just too theoretical and useless. If only I had a machine to go back in time, I could go back and prevent that film is never realized ... no, it does not matter. I just hope that as few fragile minds as possible are exposed to this. Listen to the negative reviews. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee's fans and no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. It's certain. 1/10
