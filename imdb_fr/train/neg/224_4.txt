The worst thing about Crush is not that it has been misinterpreted, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and that it's not even so bad that the filming could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst This film has some absolutely great moments that make you hope that there will be more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a lover of violin music and cheap tear-watering scenes of more than 40 women crying, taking in their arms and talking about babies and marriage, then do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I'm not myself I'm really excited to see the things listed above in a movie and, as a result, I've had a pretty awful time. The absolutely brilliant jokes can not compensate for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
