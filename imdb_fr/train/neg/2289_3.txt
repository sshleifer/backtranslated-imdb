Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to face her own problems with men. As is typical in all his work, every major male character is described as being weak, chaotic or twisted. To add to her fiction, she offers ideas and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not leave the company because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she was born again later in life, under the influence of her third husband, a minister). She left the post because she was in her thirties, her acting career had failed and she felt like she was losing her appearance. In Bettie's own words, allusions to molestation and rape are neither validated nor refuted. This is the director's attempt to pretend that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron omits to mention that Bettie created her own clothes in almost all of her sessions (she was not given to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also fails to point out that Bunny Yeager, who has made many famous shots of Bettie, also made many "naughty" shots with Bettie and that he was not the morally honest professional photographer described in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves is that Gretchen Mol looks a lot like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other more accurate and honest films and documentaries about his life and the people who make it up.
