It's very rare for me to be less laudatory about a show or movie I do not like on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is so terribly awful that it's awful. <br /> <br /> I would not have been bothered if it had been an animated series would have been better as well, I suppose, but as a live show, it is characterized by the terms "cheese" and " campy ". Of which Power Rangers. Five multicolored teenagers dressed in spandex fight evil using their martial arts skills. The costumes are awful - they look like something reminiscent of what athletes and women athletes wear. The acting is lamentable, and the choreography of combat is so shocking and so lame to watch that Jean-Claude Van Damme has the same appearance as Bruce Lee, which is a euphemism in itself. In fact, they seem to jump and dance; as if it was a version of 'The Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. In addition, there are drawings that highlight the martial arts and yet they are made in a fun way, but not so old, which makes it look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Children's and non-children's programs are so nil and on the verge of absurdity. And even if this version is located in the United States, you might think that by looking at certain combat sequences, they were not filmed in the United States, but in Japan. Thus, the "fake" fights and sequences were borrowed from the Japanese version to be juxtaposed with the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of thing, stick to the equivalent of Sentai, the Japanese equivalent.
