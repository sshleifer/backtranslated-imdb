This film is rightly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simply pathological and, worse still, it becomes almost credible for brief seconds <br /> <br /> by its pure repetition. The fact that something of this crude works, even <br /> briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You must have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself in order to get out of it, and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
