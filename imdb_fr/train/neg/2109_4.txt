Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also get used to collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, sort of. I find a casket much more comfortable than a bed. <br /> <br /> Interesting vehicle of Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) where he embodies the mad scientist. I was particularly scared when he appeared in his guests' room when they slept. <br /> <br /> Luana Walters (girls in prison) was really attractive as a sensual journalist, Patricia Hunter <who was to be a Victim, but the female power always wins over a malicious scientist. <br /> <br /> 2'11 "Angelo Rossitto and the frightening Frank Moran, who loved to fan women's hair in the movie. <br /> <br /> Interesting look at a horror movie of the years 40.
