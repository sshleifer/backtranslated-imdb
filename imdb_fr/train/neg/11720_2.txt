I read in the newspapers that W. Snipes was bankrupt and it was no wonder he was involved in low budget projects like The Contractor. He is the next star of action to join a growing club: the stars of the penniless action of the 90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays the lead role in an inexpensive action film shot in Bulgaria (we are supposed to believe that the location is in London, as only a complete idiot would buy that). The story is that of 1000 other movies: Special forces retired well A guy gets hired again by the government to do a difficult job - after the government wants to get rid of him - a good guy walks away after killing villains (was it a spoiler? guess not!) The star of the film: the girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses all other members of the cast! A star is for her more than a star for candy eyes, Lena Headey, two stars. Only for the fans of Snipes! All others: to avoid!
