The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And although I know that the suites are generally not as good as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The romance was flat, the sight was old, the spoken humor was not. It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's getting closer.
