Okay, not at all, honestly, the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It made absolutely no sense, there was no conspiracy, no characterization, no acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I saw it for the first time May 28, 2003 ** Warning, this is a spoiler alert. it is also a lot of me who complains about the bad state of the film: <br /> <br /> ok, the film begins and the characters are introduced, but it explains no explanation. As far as I know, the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. he also seemed to be living alone ... while he was a foster child ... while his mother was a raging alcoholic who still lived with him. moreover, all her friends apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> we come now to an essential point of the plot: this insane guy has left the lunatic asylum and is unleashed. now, our main character is obsessed with this guy and focuses on him to take into account the eventuality of the film. I think I must have missed an element of the main plot here, there was no REASON for the main character to become addicted. even if it is, having no reason, why all his friends, who are skeptical like 5 minutes ago, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> so that the film continues, and he gets it right. they wreak havoc on the school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... all of a sudden, everyone knows that the main character is directing the show here. wait a second, did not the madman specifically tell the main character NOT to do that? it was supposed to be anything. <br /> <br /> ah, another important element of the plot was omitted ... the insane guy was supposed not to be crazy ... everyone said he was not. but as the story continues, he is VERY CLEARLY OUT OF HIS SPIRIT. but I thought the news was saying he was not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> the movie is coming to an end. THAT WAS THE FARM? WHAT WAS THAT? not only did the end not answer questions about the main character, but she did not answer any questions about the insane guy. Are these people in the same situation? If so, then there are some basic stories that do not tend to that. if not, then what is the point of saying "it's you in two weeks"? ?? <br /> <br /> * end of the thing ... * <br /> <br /> that's what I thought then. that's about what I still think now. In 6 months, if I can get it for free, I could give it another chance, but I doubt it. I doubt it strongly.
