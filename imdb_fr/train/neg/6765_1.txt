* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critic of the media's obsession with violence. But this assertion ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers vicious and inhumane killers of innocents and contrast that with a morbid media fascination. Instead, he gives them a justification. The film describes just about all victims as people who deserve to be hurt. Engaging vicious stereotypes, Stone presents the victims in the form of unpleasant caricatures - silly idiots, broken English speaking immigrants, fat sloths. The only person that homicide lovers are also a stereotype. Of course, they make friends with the old American-Indian using hallucinogens - because they are fashionable, dude? Let's make him an admirable person. Fat, Chinese clerks and "hicks" are not cool, so give the impression that we deserve to die. Instead of crooked, hateful ones who are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and the surreal visuals attract more impressionable people. We make fun of justice. Police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scornful of GQ's murderers. Once again, this is not in the media reports in the film but in the "reality" of the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just exaggerated performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in its real reactions in the real world. Some impressionable young people who saw this film cited it as a source of inspiration for the murders they committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrible results in real life. The smart message can not be found.
