Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went to Italy, tired of the glamorous treatment in Hollywood. In the first place, he suffered the torment of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. And now, it's EUROPA 51, another tedious exercise of soggy feeling. <br /> <br /> The story does not do much for Alexander KNOX, in another ungrateful role as a long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death. of their young son. At least this one has better production values ​​and a more coherent scenario than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is always attractive here, but evolves to a more matured appearance as a woman of the rich society. She is never able to cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a friendly friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going out of my mind," she says to her husband. Prodigal statement in a film totally devoid of humor and grace, but which gives us an idea of ​​the direction that history takes. <br /> <br /> Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve his emotional health and, as a result, the plot deteriorates. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to make this project a project. for a big star like Bergman. The film loses its rhythm in the middle of the story as Bergman is more and more upset and her husband suspects she is doubling it. The story follows after she heals a terminal illness in a street. The last thread of the plot asks her husband to place her for observation in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobly from all this (excessive compensation for the loss of her son) but it is useless. Not one of his best films, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Anecdotal Note: If she wanted neorealism with a mental illness, she might have been better accepting the lead role in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! That would have done more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> In summary: another gloomy indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
