To be honest, I knew what to expect before watching this movie and I must say it's the worst acting I've ever seen. He has his moments, and at the comedy level is very entertaining, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is brought to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is everywhere. I do not know why the extraterrestrials were evil and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (I mean who would go there anyway?) But I did not care at that time because the costumes amused me and the bad CGI. As for the B-movies, it deserves the title of "being so bad, that's good," and congratulations to the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. That these movies continue long .....
