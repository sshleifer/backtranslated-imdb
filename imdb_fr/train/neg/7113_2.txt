THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This film features a rather cool opening credits (an off-screen narrator warning that movie guests will be offered a free funeral if they die of fear while watching this movie. ubiquitous scary music), but, unfortunately, the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new wife to his isolated mansion ... reprimanding his servants and friends for the fact that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy of her past. In no time, she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures him that everything is in his mind and ... well, you can probably see where all this is going. You will understand what was happening well before our hapless heroine ... because you have probably seen the same scenario in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and you did better). To add to the myriad transgressions of the movie, most of the excerpts from this movie (on many cheap DVD compilations) seem to miss a few key scenes. You see that the heroine walks slowly to the window ... she's going to open it ... you know she's going to see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts her sobbing into her husband's arms. So what did she see ??? I guess we'll never know.
