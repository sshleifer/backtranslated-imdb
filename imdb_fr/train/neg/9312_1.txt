The worst film on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can stop another person from punishing themselves with this movie. As far as acting and lighting are concerned, this film is like a bad porn without sex. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and could not have been worse even if they tried to make fun of this movie. The film had to have a small budget record that was wasted almost solely for the cover of the film. This film has now become a common joke among friends and has become the standard for comparing other films. I would like to point out that no other film even begins to compare itself. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to a friend and me to watch this film and I am surprised that she still considers me a friend after the torture I suffered. Do not see this movie!
