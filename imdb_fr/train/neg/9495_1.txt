It's a terrible movie, and no scene has an ounce of true emotion. The characters are without influence, visibly drawn, predictable and the scenario is obvious and the typical realization of Hollywood wishes. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when this film was shot, but he plays against someone in their early forties and it looks like he's 60 years. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was written to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic bond. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally - is set with obvious signs of cool 60's pre-hippie: the band of single, the hi-fi swing, the lunches in Yamashiro. But the movie is ridiculously rude, a resounding band of old fogies desperately wanting the free spirits they saw at Sunset and Laurel Canyon to find them with their big, crazy, sexy cars. The culture of youth has never been so desperate. And I shuddered thinking that Bill Holden was so desperate by the youth that he took on this embarrassing role.
