I can not believe the same guy led this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written, even if it was misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> This stack can not even claim that. It starts with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then, ignore the story that then describes what happened next. Following the story correctly could have made it a good sequel, but Craven chose to adopt the style of his older films, not having a good tie, but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor playing Dracula was different (passing black hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
