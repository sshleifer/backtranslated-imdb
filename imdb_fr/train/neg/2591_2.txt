To begin, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Even if "the naked mile" and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the fall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. First of all, the story has a very spread bow structure. First there is the introduction of the characters, then the promise of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which is exactly 25 minutes in length. Aside from the general lightness of the plot, there is little or no character development, which is a double setback of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I deeply hated the stereotypes of this film. That is to say, to show sportsmen as extremely cool guys, thinking only about sex, and to explicitly show geeks as inferior. In addition, it shows that women are only sexual objects and that men only want to treat women as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was also mediocre. With the possible exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, a generally horrible film, seen from a critical point of view. From the point of view of teenagers, I guess it's better, but this film is rated 18 years and over in most countries, so it should not really be seen by minors.
