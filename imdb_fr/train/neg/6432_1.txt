The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a label given to the senator who relied on public ignorance about World War II planes. The rear-facing mobile guns rested on a lock that would prevent the rear gunner from pulling the tail of the aircraft by preventing the gun from firing when pointing toward the tail. One day, while the senator was training on the ground, he managed to pull back from the plane. He could not have done it if the gun had been properly aligned. The artillery officer responsible for this act admitted in public, before a camera, that he was responsible - he had made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how far it is unilateral. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was the special PBS made on him. He was a hard-working, intelligent and ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to reach extraordinary heights. He made mistakes, serious mistakes, but did not shoot him in the back of an airplane. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public loves simple stories, one-way stories, so they do not have to think.
