Okay, the story - a simple-minded idiot enters a life of young chick bored to death and his little brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is slightly interesting. In any case, ideas are nothing (everyone has ...) - the execution is everything. <br /> <br /> That's what bothered me with this movie. And it really bothered me. The pace (direction, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the expected climax. We saw these huge highways five, six or seven times - why? Norton's character problems were seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / blah and take root for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a madman? The references to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and useless and certainly not favorable to this film (or to E.N.). <br /> <br /> And in my humble opinion, he is executed with the coward. Cheap emotional tips for teen lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy should have killed the kid, blame the father, create chaos. Or so the kid should have killed the father at the end, etc., but no, now we have a lame ending where kids miss the hogwash, the father is puzzled about his own life and his relationship with them and the madness, of course, dies. The happy and dysfunctional family stays safe and bored so we can enjoy our popcorn without being disturbed. <br /> <br /> And this scene where the madman enters the movie, oh my God, I would have to think long and hard to find something more stupid than that! You do not realize such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden crew. The creators of this movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than embarrassing. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas, nowhere or anywhere, and you dream of having sex with a crazy man twice as old, then you might appreciate this movie and his "message".
