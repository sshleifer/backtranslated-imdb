Oh just what I needed, another movie about 19th century England. It sounds a bit like normal England, namely that no one vandalizes football stadiums. In this picturesque setting of lords, ladies and other titles chosen at random, Charlotte Gainsbourg goes aimlessly like Jane Eyre, of this novel that no one has ever read of her own accord.Jane is used to hanging out in the cradle from Mr. Rochester, where she tries to teach a Frenchwoman to look at an empty painting all the time. but there is always the problem of his wife with the fruit cake which is locked in the attic.Oops, that was not in the brochure.After people were thrown around and that shots carefully extended (they have probably rented the set), the film finally comes to an end. Everything seemed really authentic, it's something I suppose. But again, nah.
