There are so many things that do not fit in this film, but in summary: Terrible acting - so bad that it had to be done on purpose. bad scenario - they may have good ideas but that was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad end - in some cases, the end manages to save the film - not in this case. if you manage to watch the entire movie, you will want to put yourself in the end, because the end is not even worth the wait. It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture through this movie, I would have appreciated someone warning me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then, you will regret being subjected to unnamed torture.
