Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, focuses on three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start for me. Interesting. The couples are divided into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual friends and a heterosexual man hunted "harmlessly" by a homosexual man. <br /> <br /> The couple "het" does not have much of a role to play in the film. Some scenes show how much they like to be aggressive when they have sex or having fun with each other, but do not seem to have a real goal because they are so marginalized. My hypothesis is that they represent a more everyday example of how gender and violence are integrated into the life of a couple. The couple is not very aggressive and it's not even filmed erotically. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in a gay beating by persuading a homosexual to have sex with them in an alley. It degenerates into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had was that the violence is not convincing. Never once did any of the characters seem to be in danger. It does not work. Since the whole theme of the film is about character relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help either. Sometimes it's ok, other times it's very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had smeared his face. Confusing. <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is the "harassing couple". Here, Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more consistent storyline. This may be because the characters seem to develop further and have a resolution at the end. Shiner might have been a lot better if he had stuck to those two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to do a lot with this movie. It is admirable. Most low-budget films do not aspire much. I do not think Calson realized the desire he was aiming for. Myself, I did not find anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was not convincing. This does not mean, however, that the director can not achieve something with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to have something to say.
