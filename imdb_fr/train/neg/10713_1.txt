Come on, let's be realistic. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the Templars, as they are more commonly known, did not even exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so laughable that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked really bored. And then, if you want to have a real Templar, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who still exist in Portugal. At least they should have taken history into account. The only reductive quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts seemed authentic enough to be used for medieval or Gothic works. The acting was bad, the dread scenario, the horrible action, and the props were good.
