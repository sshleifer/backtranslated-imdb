I was intrigued to see how a little seen film of 2008 had somehow won the Oscar for Best Picture of 2009 and so went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got during the two hours invested was the sad confirmation that this film had won awards only for off-the-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this film are among the weakest. you will never see. When not busy being another Bourne Identity tribute with terrific and annoying visuals of "shaking cam", it shows all the features of a second-rate daytime drama in terms of focus. The intrigue is worn out, the characterizations are about as well developed as the rejected ideas of the comic Beetle Bailey and the dialogue - in cases where the film renounces being "minimalist" and gives no apparent reason to turn one or two soldiers into gossipers - one of the worst ever recorded - in fairness the actors do their best under the circumstances, but not enough to hide the seriousness of the project. <br /> <br The whole film gives the impression that it is conceived as a kind of "fake documentary." They lacked humor and were therefore reissued as they could in order to pass for a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours on this movie, you will never spend two hours, come home and two hours lost that you will regret for the rest of your life.
