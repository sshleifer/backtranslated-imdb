Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to keep his wife young and beautiful. To this end, he looks after wives at wedding ceremonies to make them feel like they are dead so he can steal their bodies. I do not know exactly what he does with the bodies. I do not remember that it was ever fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from it and injects it into his wife. (I guess it's cerebrospinal fluid.) Cerebrospinal fluid was a rage among crazy scientists in the 1940s.) You can almost guess the rest of here. <br /> <br /> There are two (well, really more than a couple, but I will only talk about two problems I have with this movie, one is the way Bela is used. Of course, he does a pretty decent job in his own way, too aggressive (BTW, the rest of the cast is just abominable.) But, hide it in the hearse or slip it into the reporter's room, do nothing, it's silly, so why did you beat him and / or kill all his henchmen to make him look bad? Well, a person who kidnaps wives in a coma does not really need to be forced to look more perverse. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​drugging brides.Why brides ?: No woman under 20 would she do it Looking at Bela through these gyrations to find her victims, I remembered the fisherman's idiot in I know what you did last summer. that it would seem easier to achieve your goal than using a seemingly impossible plan that depends largely on circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, another title for this film is The Case of the Missing Brides, I guess that partly explains the need for "brides.")
