Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. It's a kind of bad showman that can make you feel sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made TV commercials, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the ad was about a CD Mc Carney collection). <br /> <br /> This little film looks like an advertisement for Nacho: bad story, bad staging and terrible performances. I can not believe that a disgusting movie like this is in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho was able to make this film thanks to his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with the businessmen of the Spanish television.
