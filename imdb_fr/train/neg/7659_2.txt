Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I wish it were ALL I had to say, but of course, the IMDb stipulates a number of words and all that. <br /> <br /> I'm not very optimistic about the type of bad movie that's worse. A shabby budget like Cuba's Red Zone, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director does not have a clue. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid idiot who worries about money and mocks his audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (the brain behind this shit has real waste in his belt) created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The horror movie really terribly bad. Everything is messy. A cheesy CGI, a bad script, random camera cuts and a dreadful soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a horrible movie that should not be watched by anyone. Woo hoo! Review more. Give me a bud, get started in 2006 and I will NEVER come back to it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
