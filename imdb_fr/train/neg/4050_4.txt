It is a rather outdated film that aims to show the desire of the youth of freedom in a dehumanizing British school. Oh yes, it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you are asked to do. Yes, the young dream of something else but it breaks his dreams and carries his optimism to the threshold of life. Awesome. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is how we could summarize the beautiful intentions of If ... Beautiful intentions that do not cause any cinematographic challenge: the result is a declamatory film. Do you see how boring I mean? <br /> <br /> At least, this old man helped Kubrick mount McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a really powerful social satire, without self-indulgent sentimentalism.
