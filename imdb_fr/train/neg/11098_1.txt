Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the aspect "attacked by the filmmakers" that the case seems to highlight, it is with the photo on the Cover of the filmmaker pursued by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> Then, to watch the film and discover, oh, what they mean by "filmmakers have been attacked" is that children have thrown stones on a panel and a number many people complained loudly and beat both of these children. "The photo on the cover," the hunt "so to speak? Total fabrication. Which, I suppose, is related to the theme of the film, lying and manipulating to satisfy the vain and stupid children with more money and time than meaningless. <br /> <br /> I have no idea of ​​the great truth that the viewer is supposed to take away from this movie.It's like "Roger & Me" by Michael Moore, but if "Roger "I was Moore, mocking Flint's people." "It's completely misguided and totally stupid." Hou la la! Can you believe that people who have suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets? full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and the Western media blah blah blah" because it was not fair that their fake market had prices comparable to those of their competitors was that, as many people in the movie say, prices were absurdem Someone said they should have known that it was wrong, how much they wanted duck. That does not prove anything, except that the poor people will go to a shop where prices are low, congratulations guys, how to stick to the people below. <br /> <br /> Way to make a stupid joke about the elderly. You should be very proud. How about making a documentary about Iraq for your next movie and showing how people there are going to be very excited about a house without bullets in the walls, then say, "HAHA! NO OF THESE BUT N 'EXISTS! YOUR STUPID AND STRONG TO BE BOUND BY THE MEDIA!' <br /> <br /> Morgan "Please Like Me" Spurlock unleashes this wet fart of a movie and it's no surprise that Spurlock as One Wonder, the documentary world's prince seems to throw all his weight behind any idiotic idea of ​​staying relevant in a world that really does not need him. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
