A scientist and his girlfriend drive when his speed has caused a car accident. He survives unscathed but is beheaded. He saves her head, brings her home and keeps her alive (!!!!). He then goes in search of mannequins and strippers to find the perfect body for the head. His disabled assistant watches the head begin to speak and holds a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a deformed monster in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's pretty stupid, but I had a certain penchant for that. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local TV channel broadcast this film about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoon on television - not cut. Seeing this on TV at the time was great! Explicit and bloody blood with a macabre monster and a suspicious sexual exploitation - who cares whether it was good? Seeing it now, I realize how ugly it really is. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is perfectly miserable, the production values ​​are non-existent, the scenario is rather stupid and (apart from the gore still quite disgusting). There is also a sweet cat fight between two women and the big monster at the end. Also add an end that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. On the other hand, it is a total bin. Anyway, it's not a good movie, but it's a must (for once only) for horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> Also, the laughter of the head is rather terrifying. Note the end credits to which the title is wrong (call it "The head that would not die")!
