Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I AM A CYBORG BUT THAT OK is jam-packed with little technical fun wonders with some ingenious ideas sprinkled between the two. Trying to walk in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (City of Lost Children, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful and light narrative that is a radical break with his usual morbid rate. There is really nothing wrong with his ambition or vision, but it is really unexpected to see Park's efforts add to so little. <br /> <br /> I AM A CYBORG BUT IT'S OK seems surprisingly subtract you as you go, the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the gags are hearty and the offbeat humor abounds, but it fails miserably to create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and weird and played with enthusiasm by the cast, but try, I could not bring myself to take care of it. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, perhaps indicating that Park overestimated a bit, but he still managed to highlight some of the director's unique traits and as a result an impressive filmography, he was easily forgiven. None of the confident confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. Vengeance is evident here. I AM A CYBORG BUT THAT OK left me so free that I instinctively took a quick advance from time to time (more regularly as the film progresses). I gave a LADY 5/10, and by this measure, it probably does not deserve more than a 3. For the sake of the good old days, I will be generous: 4/10
