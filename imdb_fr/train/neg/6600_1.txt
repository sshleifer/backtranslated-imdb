Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good, you're better than me! This film, although trying to imitate Laurel and Hardy by their appearance, their sound and their routine, does not allow them to honor them, nor even to be a movie of any substance whatsoever. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from the old L + H movies and unrealistically planted, the plot is confused with useless characterization of other useless co-stars, Pinchot's focus was weird for Stan, and while Sartain did a great job with Oll's accent, he was also trying hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) music number? The editing is jerky, the game is stiff, the lines are horrible, the physics is -mplausable- (even if maybe they were trying to give him that feeling of cheap sets?), And overall, it's is a terrible thing to watch. It's even more painful to watch than at ATOLL K, where the legendary duo shot their last film in the terrible writing and photography of the 1950s. Do yourself a favor and look as much as possible at the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies, and find out how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not always answer with half-feeble quips in every sentence. <br /> <br /> I pity those who think this was a decent update / boys' honor. Where was THE SONG OF THE CLASSICAL THEME?!? Why ruin 'Here's another great mess'? Why skip 'the wisest'? Why was there a bunch of useless co-stars ?! WHY MISS GULCH OF OZ ASSISTANT ???? WHY SHOULD LARRY HARMON BE IN? WHY BOZO!? And did the learning network help finance the project? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for the sake of God. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
