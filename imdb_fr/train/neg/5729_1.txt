It must be the worst movie ever !!! The acting is more scary than the movie. A lot of blood, but no idea of ​​where it comes from, because they do not even show you the cuts. I can not believe I lost my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. It's a shame for horror movies !!! For a person who lives in Asia, why is there a white policeman passing Waste Management's garbage cans ?! There is so much in another language that you do not even know what's going on half the time. The editing of the movie is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to the movies and that bad old man was working at the window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! DO NOT EVEN SEE HOW MUCH THIS IS BAD, YOU WILL BE SORRY OF YOU!
