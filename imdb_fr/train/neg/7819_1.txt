... It would be the worst movie I have ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Terrible, really ugly. <br /> <br /> I had few expectations and he did not succeed in satisfying them! Honestly, I can not think of a good thing. So here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. THE ACTION 2. THE FIELD 3. THE CGI (The Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. THE FIELD 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. THE FIELD <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, did they shoot a movie of 2:32, then realized that they had not put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the minute of play or did they really think that no one would notice that the main hero and the villain have less time on the screen than the son of Superman and the henchman he kills? !! <br /> <br /> Was half of the budget spent to persuade Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why do not doctors ask, "What the F *** do you want us to do ?! It's an alien F! Ing! We do not know anything about his anatomy! "? <br /> <br /> What has happened in the 5 years Superman left to advance 28-year-old technology? <br /> <br /> Where do people who have written good reviews watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, Why? Just why? BTW, for those of you who are wondering why Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, I think I understood it ... <br /> <br /> ... since Superman is not affected by the kryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, it's clearly in his head. therefore, the mainland thing, it's just him who removes his fear of the bright green rock .... <br /> <br /> or the writers are half-wits who did not think that c was a pretty obvious mistake.
