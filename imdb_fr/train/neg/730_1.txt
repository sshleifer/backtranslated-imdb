I did not see the first film and, if that happens, I do not really want to do it. <br /> <br /> I just watched it a few hours ago and I can not remember it. <br /> <br /> According to my recollection, her main plot seems to be a group of very boring people staying in a house with this shady old woman on Friday the 13th and being followed by a wooden man's board . <br /> <br /> Some people die, the film ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold me this film because I want to get compensation for the time lost in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this film out of my hands ...... oh, wait, I've already given it to a "friend".
