Entertainment Tonight, the shows have been going down for a few years, but since last night (August 17, 2006) they have reached a new low. <br /> <br /> To try to hype their show, they decided to post real photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers last night ... saying "Pictures of the case you do not" have never seen before. " Both photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of his face and his head / neck and one could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle him around his neck and make bruises on his face. It was so horrible that I could not believe it. How does this relate to anything remotely connected to Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing!! They dropped their level of dignity and values ​​to a new low level ... and it shows. It was once THE first show to watch ... and it's just unpleasant now. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch Access Hollywood from now on.
