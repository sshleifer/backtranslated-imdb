Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never finish, would have been better if all the characters had been neutralized in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need him? As depressing as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR DREAM and as nightmare as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not as entertaining as one of the aforementioned dark movies. Although free cannibalism could make the hearts of aspiring Jeffery Dalmers run a little faster, he was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it as interesting as late night infomercials and as exciting as a dentist visit. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to bear that, if not, for anyone. I was really surprised that this one was not made by Brain Damage employees because it was the quality of the dead creatures.
