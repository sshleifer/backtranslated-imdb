If the screenwriter / director reads this (and I imagine that is the case since you should now be unemployed), I must tell you that I saw bad movies in my day, but this one has the peculiarity of having the worst premise I have ever heard of. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total loss of time. I burst out laughing at the end. <br /> <br /> NOTE OF SUPPORT - (If all the film was in a coma, does the scene where she sleeps with this guy mean that someone raped her while she was stunned? ?) <br /> <br /> Ultimate waste.
