I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was anxious to become hooked on another great series of channels (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but this one was slowly eroding every episode of season 1 that I watched. (did not survive the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was neither original nor artificial, and the depiction of blacks was embarrassing. The dialogue was forced, as if writers were trying too hard to be smart and trendy. It was a rare moment when I actually made an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been taken to To Catch A Predator) and the removal of Hodes' daughter, Quinn, from the cast by sending him to Mexico's boarding school was so original and cliche. I had to conclude that the writers were testing the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode after episode, the characters I liked less and I could not overcome a lot of the technical flaws of the plot. <br /> <Add to that I heard that Season 2 was not so good, so I lost all motivation to keep watching this piece. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of good castings and good writing, I think this show will be a challenge for you, unless you get smashed and all the bets are open.
