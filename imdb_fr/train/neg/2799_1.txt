Anyone who wrote the screenplay of this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (he does not even live there), and these actors have to find another job. The most terrible time and minutes of my life ... and I was just watching to see if it would improve, which unfortunately was not the case for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credits have me worry. I guess there was not a lot of people behind the movie, so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is really an excellent guide "How not to make a movie". Too bad I can not give a 0.
