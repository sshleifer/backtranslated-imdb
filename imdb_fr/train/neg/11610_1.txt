There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra was both a talented actor and a talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays can get a scene in one take, and that was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on set. the movies really started to go away. The Tony Rome police series was meant to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series, which was released at the same time. Maybe even a James Bond contest, but nothing really worked for Frank during those years. His personal life in ruins, his music fading ... Sinatra was more like a return to the 50s. The last great Sinatra movie of this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
