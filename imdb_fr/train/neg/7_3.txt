It's really a new low in entertainment. Even if the movies are much worse. <br /> <br /> In the genre Gangster / Drug scene, it is difficult to have a convincing scenario (this film does not do it, I mean for example, the motivations of Sebastian could not be more A clich√© far fetched and worn out.) Then you'll also need a framework of character relationships that's credible (that's not the case.) <br /> <br /> Of course, Tristan is attracted far of his family, but why was it still? what's the problem with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture however to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of children in the family of the upper class. But this film does not go in this direction. Although there would be a potential to judge by the random Backflashes. Was he not already on the ground, why does he still? <br /> <br /> There are some interesting questions raised here for a solid socially critical drama (but again, this film just is not, because it focuses on production techniques "cool" and characters a moment of reflection and especially to force the story along the path they wish to make and not pay attention to what the story breathes and evolves naturally.) <br /> </ br> > That wants to be a drama to not glorify substance abuse and violence (it would be wrong policy nowadays, is not it?), But on the other hand, it's nothing more that a cheap action movie (as there are so many), with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who manages not to totally ruin what remains of reputation by doing what he always does . <br /> <br /> So, overall, I ... do not ... recommend it. br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
