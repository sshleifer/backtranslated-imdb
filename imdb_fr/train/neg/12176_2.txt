The first film of Trancers is by no means an excellent film. There were huge holes in the plot and very little internal logic. However, it was entertaining, better done than most low budget B movies, and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is none of that. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from the same problems as most flop suites. The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is tasteless. It seems that the people behind this film felt that bringing back the familiar faces of the first movie would be enough, without worrying about anything else. Even B-level actors such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs failed to get the film out of the mud. <br /> <br /> Brief overview of the plot: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop of the future who was sent in 1985 to save the ancestors of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first film, and both live with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent to protect him in the past. We discover that Whistler's brother (the villain of the first film) is back in time to create an army of Trancers, people transformed into unscrupulous zombies to kill Ashby. Jack's mission is complicated by the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack traveled to the past, was also fired to arrest Whistler's brother, and Jack now finds herself working with her. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. The first is that the method of creating Trancers in this film is radically different from that used in the first film. What annoys him is that, in a rather mediocre example of Soviet revisionism, they act as if it is still the technique. <br /> <br /> The other thing that bothers me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) has very little time on the screen. It bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the plot of the film. It was like it was just something that had been thrown to fill the space in the movie. The character of Alice in particular seems very indifferent to the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find that he is remarried, which makes it very superficial or very poorly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of watching this movie is if you are interested in watching the whole series Trancers (currently six films in total). Otherwise, even if you are a fan of the first Trancers, stay away from this lukewarm suite.
