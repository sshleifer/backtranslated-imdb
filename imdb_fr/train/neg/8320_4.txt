After watching Awake, I came to a conclusion: director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the viewer, for the simple reason that the movie is full of ridiculous elements. Awake has many absurd elements and ridiculous (for example, the hospital uniform used by the spirit of the main character ... did the ghost of a doctor leave him on the ground?). The concept of this film is slightly ingenious, but all the intrigues and movies are stupid and crap. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen has no expression and so does Jessica Alba. It's a ridiculous and absurd thing that you can not take it seriously. My recommendation is this: skip this shitty movie.
