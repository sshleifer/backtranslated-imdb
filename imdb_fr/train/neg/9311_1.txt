The cover on the DVD and the disc is really great, you'd think they made a movie about Sweet in Black Twist Metal that's still a good idea, but the actors in this movie are worse than Ben's in Pearl Harbor , porns have better quality and better actors. I was going to buy the DVD, but luckily I rented it first, the plot and the screenplay are also horrible, nothing seems to go together so the movie really does not make sense. Bad attempts to scare you by using flashback scenes are much worse than those used in the 80s sitcom series, and in the end, it will leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house.
