"Cut" is a film about film students making a film. It's totally in the mold "Scream", an ironic and self-referential horror film that, for me at least, falls because, despite its irony, it's still a bad horror film , just like the movies he refers to. fr /> <br /> But it was not without its charms. Good, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as a bitchy and spoiled American actor hating every minute of working with the Australian amateur film crew. She was so convincing that it's tempting to believe that it's not an act, although everyone involved in "Cut" says she was delighted to work with her. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of his pouting, pouting, or snapping was great. Everyone, however, hesitated between being OK and being terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, some buckets of gore (some are surprisingly horrible), and is finally .. only another bad horror movie.
