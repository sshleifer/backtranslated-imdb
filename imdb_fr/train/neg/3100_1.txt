Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where to start?!? <br /> <br /> This film offers Manos - The Hands of Fate and the War of the Future, the worst film of all time. It's fun to laugh, while Manos was painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the ideal movie to describe the term: "80's Cheeze". The acting game (and I use this term vaguely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you'll ever see, and the battle of garden tools must be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and the bots a lot of ammo to shoot some of the funniest one-liners they've ever made. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and bots ..... God help you !!
