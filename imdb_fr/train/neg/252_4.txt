An uninspired direction leaves a decent distribution in a beautiful but faded adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than sincere, and ghostly ghost appearances fail to conceal the slightest respect or magic; Edward Woodward, as Ghost of Christmas Present, wavers on stilts and seems to make an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As a Scrooge, George C. Scott is too ironic and he never really seems to believe it, which deprives his effectiveness of his performance. The scenes in which he shows his past have as much impact as if he flipped through his family album without enthusiasm. No one else seems to be doing anything except Frank Finlay, who over-feeds chronically.
