Overlong drama that is not able to make a real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love. There is a certain eccentricity among characters and in dialogue and situations, but it is the kind that is bad for the film, making it seem often absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, who plays the main role, who speaks as a semi-retarded, so there is no choice but to watch the film as a retarded girl who evolves in the world of theater - which was clearly not the goal. We are told very early (in this narration in the manner of "Barry Lyndon") that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the film suffers. She walks essentially like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely believable given her lack of emotions. Sometimes the movie had that boring and sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie. Is this one? I would not be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism only works very rarely. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my list of Hollywood nepotism, with more than 350 photos / entries, contact me by e-mail.
