In an interview, David Duchovny said he was not able to watch even the first hour of this movie - and you should not do it either. The scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could have drawn his performance from any episode of X-Files . He is in autopilot for all the film. Brad Pitt exaggerates dreadfully.
