Another film about a tortured, selfish, arrogant, insensitive and self-destructive protagonist who should interest us. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm very open to all kinds of things, wall movies that have a strong self-destructive character as their main character. What I am opposed to about this one is that there is so little background on this type. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script had treated more, they might have been able to generate sympathy for him. As such, he presents himself as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, but only hateful. <br /> <br /> After bothering to make this guy as crazy and anti-social as possible and make his fate so dark The writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending. /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but that's where he puts up a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
