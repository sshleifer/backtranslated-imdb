The only buyout was the small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be "Something about Mary", but I did not even like this movie and it still did not respect those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her character Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father felt he was trying too hard to be Randy Quaid's character from National Lampoon's Vacation movies.
