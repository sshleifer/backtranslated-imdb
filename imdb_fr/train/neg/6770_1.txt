I went to see this film with my 17 years. girl. I insisted that we go up in the morning, not because I'm a boring runner, but just as if I had done it. In the NASCAR spirit, it's the sponsor's dream. So much blatant publicity that she is almost called info-mercial, if there was no so-called actor. Faithful to tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its narrative lines, the car is only a "vehicle" (no pun intended) for this corn ball of a film. The first Herbie payments (although cheese) have been produced during more severe periods, which makes them a little easier to digest. Mrs. Lohan, Queen of Disney's reigning theater, has a weak ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon were involved in such a project. Only the snack bar, was a bigger scam!
