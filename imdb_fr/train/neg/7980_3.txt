This comedy of service, for which Peter Marshall (the brother of Joanne Dru and later animated by The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were put forward as "the new Lewis and Martin" is just shy fast and nothing is going very well - there is a scene in which Noonan throws grenades at officers and angry politicians; they are about five feet apart, Noonan throws them between the two, and the reaction is that everyone cracks. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a horror relieved only by the fetch, Julie Newmar, there are some moments of clarity: Marshall and Noonan engage occasionally in a double conversation and argue, and their timing is almost perfect - obviously, it was a well-honed duo of comedies. <br /> <br /> That's not enough to save this turkey, alas.
