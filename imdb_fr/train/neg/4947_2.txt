Dieter Bohlen, famous German composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits such as "You are my heart, you are my soul" felt the need to tell his story - and he graciously decided to appeal to a ghost writer. The result was a fun book about his life. Well, more or less a blurred image of it. He did not deny that he is a selfish jerk, but the whole story has been distorted to match his image of himself. No word that he probably beat his ex-wife and she ended up in the hospital. However, it was written in a fun style and was a great success after appearing as a jury member for the German version of "American Idol" - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned TV show "Idol" titled "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS), someone must have had the terrible idea of ​​making a movie of the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a film that tries so desperately to be funny and that fails so completely. None of the gags really reaches the point. Naddel's voice and his style of conversation immediately irritated me, although the voice of Verona should have done more. Obvious, childish, predictable and long-winded gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie all the way through in minutes. The film's content is a sloppy film adaptation crushed by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's idealized botched memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost anything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that Bohlen is the background voice is the guarantee that the whole film has nothing satirical at all. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder he was considered too bad for a movie. The probability that this thing rotted in some archives was quite high until recently, when the current DSDS season proved to be a poor success. With the "friendly" help of the biggest German yellow newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation in which the RTL television channel has something to add, the program "Wetten dass ...?", Always unbeatable is Screened on Channel 2, the film has finally arrived on television - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there certainly are better cartoons with a lot more fun and a story that really deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
