A series of painfully funny skits that seem to last forever and one day. Not as abominably abominable as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but it does not in any way constitute endorsement in any way whatsoever. Features the worst clown that ever rhymes. At most if not offensive to anyone, if not the most prudish or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody ever put on the film, Arnold EVER's worst identity theft (not just the worst filmed, literally the worst ever). I do not know why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would be on the bill (the reasons I looked at this in the first place). The only thing that was slightly amusing was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this film to anyone, but the people who commit to life to make sure that it is at the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you, live people. Moreover, if it is true that the Church of Scientology is hating it, it can not be ALL bad. <br /> <br /> My note: D
