I am first and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a "parody". Crispin Glover is very serious about his movie. He personally introduced the film during the screening I saw in Chicago. He worked on the film for years and is the first in a trilogy. "What is it?" This is Crispin Glover's attempt to make an art film like those he idolizes of Herzog, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I had heard about this movie years ago crispin glover. "When he finally came out, I watched the trailer online and read the synopsis ... I'm went to Chicago to see him and it was a big disappointment.If he came out of the shit, like the potty-smoking grandmother and the dancing dolls, he would have something much better, but about ten minutes barely. <br /> <br /> In other words Just watch the trailer, be entertained and stay there.There are striking images and juxtapositions and fantastic phrases, but his lack of concentration is a disappointment.
