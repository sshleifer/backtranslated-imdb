I gave him a four purely out of his historical context. He was considered lost for many years until he appeared spontaneously at Showtime in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Moe is a straight man and Larry and Curly introduce themselves as duets. Spade Cooley has some numbers. I guess it has something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal that nothing really stays in my memory. I vaguely remember it was a Western musical. Even the Stooge seem to take action. Overall, there is nothing really to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of Stooge, do not worry. If you are a fan of Stooge, stay with the shorts.
