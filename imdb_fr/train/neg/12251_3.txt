Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. A sin with is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is misused in this Jaws scam. <br /> <br /> Okay, whoever read a number of my posted comments probably noticed two things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If there's a cute guy in this low-budget movie, I'll usually make that point. So, let's withdraw it now. It's a low budget horror movie that I did not like. The acting is mostly horrible, the effects are laughable, and the scenario rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've seen this year. As for the cute resident boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins this award hands down. This boy is hot! And, surprisingly, he is not just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a nice ass ... he can actually play (well, as much as possible in this odious film). Now that the chores are over, let's move on. <br /> <br /> In the version of Cliff Notes, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to give anything away). ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a distant island to film a documentary about two surfers (a well-established cute boy and his boyfriend) who are surfing with sharks. Unbeknownst to them, a rather large saltwater crocodile hides around the island. Croc appears, chaos ensues and people are eaten. Generate end of series. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie is rather staggering. Everything started well, but he soon became stupid and stupid. A main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heroes declare injustices at the expense of the victims. Moreover, if this crocodon is at the top of the food chain, both on land and in water, what is there with all the sharks? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think a few skinny sharks would stick around. The FX is among the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. The CGI is horrible, and they even managed to screw up the animatronic fangs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The fang hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. Obviously, you have not referred to any of these things to judge by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film. And what about the gang of pirates / drug pushers? Do you just need another reason to rip off a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny to see how we get small sub-genres in the world of cinema. With Alligator and its suites, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it seems now that "oversized crocodile / alligator" movies should now have their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought that Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My note: D-
