(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to take seriously. In some places he is so stupid that I can not help but laugh at all of this. Try me for the sequence where the Stallone character jumps about 20 meters with a complete climbing gear or (and that's really my favorite) chokes a villain by sticking it on a stalactite. Yes, what impious force has he mobilized to accomplish such feats? I do not know, but it really gives a chance to reality.
