I just did not have this movie ... Was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and dances in it ... <br /> <br /> Was it a serious drama .... no, the acting was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a serious actor and quality .. Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> I struggled to stay awake during this disjointed movie. The message about apartheid and the "tribute" to students who died during a student rebellion is noted. But as entertainment, it was very mediocre and as a documentary film, it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but honestly, I hated it
