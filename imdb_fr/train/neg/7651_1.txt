This should not shock you when I tell you that Alone in the Dark is a shitty movie. To put it bluntly, it's as if a manure monster had defecated, eaten the result, and then vomited. The final product would still surpass this movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on an old video game Atari (!), The film has something to do with a portal on the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations. Something about the existence of two worlds, darkness and light. (Guess which ones are ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago, an advanced civilization really super-duper opened the portal, the demons passed and exploded, then wiped out the civilization. That's why we have never heard of them, conveniently enough. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps regretting the time of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old . He is on the trail of one of the artifacts of the advanced civilization. Carnby was part of a secret institution called 713, which tries to understand what happened to this long-standing civilization. But Carnby thought he was not going to be able to find the answers he was looking for and so left the group. <br /> <br /> But you see, these creatures are out and their preys are done in different ways, such as cutting them, dividing them in half, implanting neurological control devices or transforming them simply murderous zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's about as distilled as I can do the plot. It's quite complicated and incomprehensible. In similar films, one could see the intrepid seeker / adventurer understand things one step at a time, and when we are onlookers mentally with the researcher, it's very entertaining. But when scenes go from one attack to another without perspective or context ... it's not so much fun. <br /> <br /> The acting game is terrible, except for Slater, who (although he seems almost embarrassed to be in the film) has shown that he was able to carry the charge by interim. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is chosen as a museum curator! Honestly, I thought I saw the cast of a life when Denise Richards was chosen as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here is Richards, shit emitter for shit. Among the highlights, Reid pronounced "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land"; Reid gave him most of his lines in a monotonous, dazed and dazed tone (a bit like she'd spent all night in front of the camera before filming), Reid - a museum curator, notice, spend most of the movie in a top with a belly and jeans low waist. Oh yes, she was as credible as Jessica Simpson who was giving stock quotes. Oh, why should pretty girls be so stupid? (Note: I do not think Tara Reid is so beautiful, she seems to always need food.) Almost all the other actors are completely forgettable, with the possible exception of Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders. The character of Dorff was not very developed, but nothing in the film was, from the sets to the characters through Tara Reid. But I am moving away from the subject. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the disconcerting and completely absurd scenario is hard enough to follow as the film moves at such a dizzying pace, but director Uwe Boll launches into a stunning soundtrack and deafening; it's so loud that you can not hear what the actors say in certain scenes! It can not be right. However, given the level of actor, thank you to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a funny note. The opening moments of the film include narration ... words that crawl on the screen at the same time. Do you remember the first Star Wars? You've heard this familiar Star Wars theme as the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need something to read what's on the screen for me? Were producers just looking for blind people? This may also explain why the soundtrack was so noisy - they were also looking for hearing-impaired people. In addition, the narrator inexplicably got a soap opera for the first lines of the crawl - and then lost it. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark is a dodgy and powerful hodgepodge, a dreadful scenario, an incoherent scenario and a laid-back staging. Hardly a note sounds right. There is so much chaos that the public just stops worrying about the characters and the roots of their disappearance. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can not quite ascribe this mark to the lowest note, because I had little hope it would start - and because it never attracted me enough to get me excited about it. It's atrocious, although Slater is buying himself a little bit.
