Ok, let me tell you about it ... IT'S HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a sophisticated job during the first cruel intentions, why did he do such a bad job in this area? I'm sorry but this movie is stupid, it is true that he could have improved if his series had already been broadcast, but let's be realistic ... this movie has a pot! Many bad actors * NOTE The shower scene * "Kissing cousins" ?????? What kind of line is this? "Slipery when wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This film has made efforts, I will give you that, but it was too silly! They even tried to make it funny by giving the servants of the house stupid accents that, in fact ... was not funny! It was pathetic. Not to mention the fact that they gave everyone involved an absolutely unique look. It's as if they make them look different on purpose or something! I like to watch when I am really really what is not happening from time to time. For those of you who loved it ... Okay, what were you thinking? Could you possibly choose this film in relation to another film that had an excellent performance and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A film is gold if Sarah Michelle Gellar is there, DUH! But this movie does not do it, no offense Amy Adams. Oh yes since when does SÃ©bastien have a heart ????? UGH!
