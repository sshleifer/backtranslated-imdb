If you ever hear those three words ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a low-budget action film based on a sheriff of Geronimo in a city of Texas. (pronounced as Heronimo). He is an ugly, gooey and rude character in search of a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner collapses twice in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere. Plus, he shoots everyone like the Wild West. I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. A policewoman is responsible for showing her around Malta (which looks like Elaine de Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can handle the redneck. She must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The bar strippers are the most amusing characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I started to bond with the sordid women. At least it was better than watching Geronimo try to get out of something. The end is imperfect and somewhat predictable, and I was happy that it was finally over. You'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker's film. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how it was in THREE Bond movies ... very weird! Anyway, if you want to laugh, check this one on MST3K from time to time. In addition, I heard his other bad movie (among many others), the "Mitchell" version of MST3K was released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
