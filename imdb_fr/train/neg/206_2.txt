I gave 2 stars to this film only because Dominic Monaghan made a lot of effort in his acting. All the rest of this film is extremely amateurish. All that was associated with the making of this film was very poorly executed. The director should not only rethink what she does for a career in life, but maybe she should watch some movies. Dominic Monaghan being a very credible actor, placing him in a movie of this caliber makes him awful. No matter who played, Jack's best friend should never have been in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be devoted to the characters and their environment. Do not waste your time and money on this movie (as I did), you will be deeply disappointed.
