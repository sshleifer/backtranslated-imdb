I liked the movie a bit despite its frantic pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was called Montana North. It certainly is not Montana North and never will be. Americans are wondering why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that's one of the reasons. Stop teaching children in the United States of America that they own the planet. Such a centrist worldview is not becoming one of the greatest nations in the world. Even jokingly. I would never talk about the United States as "Alberta South". Walt would never belittle us, so why start now. Other than that, the movie was pretty bad, better luck next time.
