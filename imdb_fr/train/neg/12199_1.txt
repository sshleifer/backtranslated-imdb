me and my sister have now watch this movie. we laugh at the deaf. can you imagine on the covers there is nomination for Oscar ?? --your musician has to mix about 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- the main character Silvester do not integrate it there. it looks like the Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- The Russian soldiers are everything, but not the Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. A plane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What's an idea when Rambo will jump off the plane, but he stayed? rope rope 3. a girl? the best scene is when she dies. She is very important to him. he's known it for ages? he cries for her, ... o my samurai god 4. how many arrows does he have? his arrow bag is always full of arrows? I did not notice a scene where he retrieves them - but I saw the scene where Arrow stays in Vietnam - it's very important 5. How many rockets can the helicopter hold ??? (the real one) I saw 4. but the Rambos hit about 20. <br /> <br /> 6. the main part. What does the Russian special army helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. first scene when he enters the Vietnamese camp ... his first idea was to release the refuge that is standing on the tree, in the open air. What idea to redo: 1. With the knife, you can cut the cable iron? can only be made in Vietnam? 2. mortar - use to hit a man running? o my god, u Americans really need to learn about guns! do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer has watched too many films from the Second World War)
