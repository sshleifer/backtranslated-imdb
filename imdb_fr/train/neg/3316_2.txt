It was Ewan McGregor's first film I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then, I have become a huge fan of Ewan McGregor but I still can not forgive this film for the existence of this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and because of that, has been subject to various classics, Emma being one of them. I have always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible interpretation, I was forced to admit that the first Emma was charming and charming. Ewan McGregor is useless in this movie after hacking and mutilating the role of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is insipid and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone interested in the British drama of the time ... go see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... trust me, by skipping this movie, you've missed nothing except five minutes together with him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
