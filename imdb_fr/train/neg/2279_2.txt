Damn it, that bloody mess was. But it only lasts an hour and I only pay the money, so I'm going to live ... unlike the whole cast of this 1933 clunker that's all dusty now. <br /> <br /> In any case, a small village begins to have corpses found emptied of all their blood. Local thugs start talking about vampires, of course, and a little louder after each corpse is found The sheriff or police officer of the city or whatever, played by the impressive actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them the opposite. When he mentions that the dead have a big hole on each side of the neck, instead of two close-quarters, the locals say The police officer insists that there are no vampires and that must be a human culprit who kills the murders. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not seem too bothered anyway.He spends most of his time trying to get into his darling's pants, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the simpleton town, played by Dwight Frye, who still scares the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood.Lionel Atwill plays the role of the city doctor who apparently tries to help the policeman solve crimes. And a boy As an actor, he always feels the same actor. In this role, he is as close to the cardboard as he could. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this business .... a lot of big names to be such a bunch of guano. <br /> <Apart from the terrible false title that this film has, the alternative name, "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this film is also dull and scathing and just silly. <br /> <br /> For me the top The point of the film is to watch Frye, he nails the weird strange city but apart from him this movie did not offer much. And then when you discover the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect that demanded all that blood I will really be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least it was fun and interesting to watch. Think If you can not make a good horror movie of the 1930s, put at least Lugosi in the skin of Lugosi. <br /> If you can not make a good horror movie of the 1930s, put at least Lugosi in it.
