I just saw this at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival The synopsis of the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check it out. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being poorly written, it was boring. I will not hold the actors because they could not do much with this bad scenario. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without irony, too serious without being funny. The movie would have been better if Hunt Hoe had gone with a campy horror sensation. Instead, he took himself seriously and this resulted in a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. It was too long and all weak.
