People who have loved Problem Child (1990) must have their head examined. Who would agree to watch a little male boy wreak havoc on others and find him funny? The movie is not funny, anyway, from start to finish. It's meant to be a cartoon, but the writers do not realize that the slapstick is not funny when people are attacked by bears or hit with a baseball bat. It may sound funny in cartoons, but not in movies. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver), who, since his childhood, was placed in front of the doors of adoptive parents. for adoption. Families reject it because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes the nuns and writes letters of correspondence to the culprit of the murderer Bow-Tie (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child to look like all the other parents in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family and "Little" Ben is interested in him, despite destroying a camping trip by drawing a bear to the site or casting a cat on his father "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), a sectarian politician. <br /> <br /> I think we are supposed to worry about Junior so he can catch him off guard when he gets revenge on others. Her new mother, Flo, is a bitch, her grandfather is completely selfish and a little girl - who despises adopted children - is such a spoiled kid. <br /> <br /> But what does Junior do to get the latest laughs are not funny - it's mean, cruel, and sometimes deadly. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the film? That children must solve the problems of violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to condemned killers? They certainly do not do what it's like to be a bad kid. Junior is not one - he's just a little sadistic twerp. There was a time when it was difficult for children to hit others. Now, everyone laughs when Junior beats kids with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that this film was presented as a "family comedy". The worst thing is that Problem Child is PG rated. What did the MPAA think when they saw this? There is a lot of blasphemy and petty farce here, one can wonder about the division between the PG and the PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will appreciate this, but parents will be shocked by what is happening. represented on the screen. And for most people, Problem Child will be considered a classic of "guilty pleasure". a film that someone will shamefully admire, even if the prevailing opinion, put forward by more serious viewers, is that the film is a shit.
