It seems that the brilliant Shonda Rhimes team has outsourced the writing of this one somewhere off the coast, perhaps in the MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of David Kelly's many tedious films (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal), tedious at the beginning of the season but predictable. The crazy cases they encounter are so bizarre that they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what really motivates good medical dramas: dramatic situations you're afraid of, the feeling "maybe it's me". They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are good enough, but the intrigues are dead and can not be brought back to life. I am a therapist and let me tell you that Amy Brennan is the most incredibly incompetent, unethical and untrained therapist. Anyone who wrote it missed ethics and transfer / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give them a code of ethics to read (the episode with the bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). No therapist is so bad. <br /> <br /> Women who yearn for men who have gone - were beaten to death, we all graduated "Sex and the City". Addison in her young assault on the guy she loves - very inappropriate for her age, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 and this otherwise talented actress does not believe herself and does not succeed very well. The only successful / enjoyable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to Los Angeles, the "Dr. Voodoo" and her adaptation to widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept could work with a brand new editorial team.
