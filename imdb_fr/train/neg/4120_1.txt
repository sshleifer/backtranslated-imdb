Absolutely horrible film. Ameteurish and it's not funny at all. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. The edits of E.T and Star Wars are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good reflex about this film. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal, this movie is a garbage can. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is his worst work ever written. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's music is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac is also present. The actor who plays the three sons has no talent, anyway.
