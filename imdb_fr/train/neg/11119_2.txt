Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up to play basketball on the basketball court. Ok, that sounds good there. This leaves a lot of room for a good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in the many boring minutes of this pathetic attempt at a film. This film became redundant, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite movies. Woody from Cheers, and I could not wait to see it in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance", I came to the conclusion that he should continue to play idiotic peasants who bartend. His playing was as drab and poor as the movie. Rosie Perez is another actress of this unreal film. I liked the movies with Perez before, but I decided that I liked the other works of her career, it's because she was not a main character and she did not have a lot of Conversation lines (Do the Right Thing). But now, in White Men Can not Jump, she has become a central character with many aftershocks, which means the audience has to endure her incredibly annoying and moaning voice. So, having seen this film (term used vaguely) and heard Rosie Perez much more than appreciated, I can now say that I am a white man and I am preparing to jump. . . out of a building of twenty floors.
