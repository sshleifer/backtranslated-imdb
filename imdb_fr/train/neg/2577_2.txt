This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a VHS viewfinder never seen before. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a great story - about seriously disabled people in a hospital and their various personalities - quickly became a very secular drama with inimitable characters. <Br/> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe), the stereotype of a white person who tells the f-word every two sentences and is so despicable that he did not give her the first name of the movie. It is very fun to be around. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-paced womanizer. Snipes must have liked these arrogant and "arrogant" roles because he played in many of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump". Then the sweet Helen Hunt plays "Anna", this wonderful caring and loving person who has an adulterous affair with the main character of the film, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yeah, that's comforting and reassuring. It makes me hot to watch these nice guys. But, if you are one of those who loves the shabby characters portrayed by lousy people in this shabby movie ..... you could really like that! Add a dose of politically correct to Hollywood and voila! What more could one want?
