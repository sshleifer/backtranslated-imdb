Bangville police reportedly marked the beginning of Keystone Kops, after the name of the studio they were working for. In this one, however, they do not dress up with the foolish cops' outfits and do not drive the fast-paced car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl who begged her father to give her a calf. She later sees strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. We answer and the pursuit is launched. Then Mabel slams her door just as someone enters. It turns out that it's his mother who jumps to the conclusion that thieves are here! So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, the father and mother try to make their way! It was perhaps the most amusing part of the short film with some explosions of the policeman's car. It was 7 short minutes that went by so fast that it's over before it starts. Mabel is the only real feature developed. She breathes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so cheerful with optimism here, except, of course, when she's scared. It's easy to see why she became a star. It was largely because of her that I recommended seeing this at least once and why I give her a 4.
