Since most of the critics of this film are projections seen about ten years ago, I would like to add one more recent, the film is opened with archive footage of the bombing of B-17 in Germany, the The film was cut by the character of Oskar Werner Hauptmann (captain) Wust and his assistant who runs to cover himself as he heads for Hitler's Fuehrer Bunker. Once inside, they are debriefed by the bunker staff, the film is then screened on one of the many conference scenes where Albin Skoda gives a decent impression of Adolf Hitler rallying his officer to "Ultimate". Victory "while the character of Werner is about to realize that the inhabitants of the bunker are caught in a fantastic world - some non bunker events are described, the most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a Russian advance to through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak unit and his family's difficulties in surviving - this film suffers from a number of inaccurate details that a German film made only 10 years after the Second World War should not have included, the actor describing Goebbels (Willy Krause) wears the same uniform as Hitler, including the eagle-arm-Goebbels wore a Nazi Party brown uniform with a swastika armband - the soldier "SS "carries the camouflage of the German army, the well-documented scene of Hitler assigning the Iron Cross to the boys of the Hitler Youth is presented as having occurred INSIDE the bunker ( it was done outside in the courtyard) and, finally, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a 1922 pattern of Belgian browning - most clients agree that it was A Walther PPK The acting game also seems totally inaccurate, the drunken dance scene close to the end of the film is remarkable, this piece is presented in the form of a cabaret sketch, with a wounded soldier drunk (his arm in a splint) wielding a goose moving to the rhythm of the music nurse does a strip-tease / belly dance combination, by candlelight ... it's really embarrassing to watch - the moment the more incredible is when Captain Wust wins a single audience with Hitler from Skoda, Hitler is shown as slumped on a drugged, delusional bench, when Werner's character begins to question him, Hitler starts screaming and brings in an SS guard who has mortally wounded the character of Werner in the back with a shot. This fabricated scene is not based on historical narrative. -The character of Werner dies in an antechamber while Hitler prepares his own end. Hitler's farewell to his staff is shown, but suicide is on the screen, the last second of the film show Hitler's Funeral Pyre Smoke slowly forming into a spectrum image of the late Oskar Werner's face / Hauptmann Wust - this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would be better off watching more recent movies such as the 1973 remake "Hitler: the last 10 days" or the German film "Downfall "(Der Untergang) if they want a more accurate account of this dramatic story, these two latest films are based on first-person accounts, with" Hitler: the last 10 days "bein g compiled from the autobiography of Gerhard Boldt as staff officer in the Fuehrer Bunker and "Downfall" according to the book of Hitler's secretary, the scenario of "Der Letzte Akte" is taken from the judge's trial of the US Nuremberg trial, M ichael Musmanno, "Ten days before" die, which is more a compilation of events (many obviously fanciful) than eyewitness story - it is astonishing that the tale of Hugh Trevor Roper, "The last day of Hitler "has never been turned into a movie.
