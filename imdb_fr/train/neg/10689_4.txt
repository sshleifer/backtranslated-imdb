Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself for the assassination of the American president. I will point out immediately that this is not the kind of role for which this very talented actor is known, and this film shows us why. He teamed up with an inviting journalist (Angie Harmon) to discover the plot surrounding the president's death, etc., blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a James Woods cast, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fail to catch your attention, clearly and simply; part of the action is good, the acting is not quite bad and the story, although clich√© and made before, could have given rise to an entertaining and enjoyable film - WELL IT'S NOT! The writing of the script and staging is the guarantee, at no time does it take you into the story or make you think of any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's Boring, Predictable and dull.
