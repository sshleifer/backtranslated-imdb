This film tells three stories that seemed to have been filmed without anyone knowing that it was a film composed of a vignette. Manufacturers tell the three thumbnails by connecting them to the Martin Kove nickname, although some of the tracks are never seen with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette has the sexy woman Vivian Schilling, a woman scared of all sunshine (she looks brave to Adrian Monk), having a paranoid evening at home alone. You will literally scream Vivian for doing ridiculous things. She spends most of her time in a nightgown that shows her amazing features. But his film is the worst, if not the most scathing. <br /> <br /> The second sticker belongs to Bill Paxton, who represents Hell's roommate. His geek roommate allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny because a man fears that death will take him at any time, much like his friend who was strangled to death by an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, because the film as a whole seems to be cut in pieces, with very little thought. A must for Bill Paxton fans.
