Why?!! It was a tasteless film, uninspired and embarrassing. The embarrassment comes from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people shoot such a BAAAAAD film in this country? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... without a ROBO. All this has been changed with the kindness of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible rendition of this classic cartoon character. Seeing Matthew Broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either. Sheesh !!
