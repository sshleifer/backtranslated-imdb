In fact, I like Asylum movies. I used to see as much as possible. Even the scams they committed were cool, like EXORCISM and WHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is simply lame. I can not believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE have actually made this film too !!! It's not even ridiculously bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way, are pretty bad). It's just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive the mediocre or unhealthy special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film is taken too seriously. I really hope SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. This is a movie that I am eager to see.
