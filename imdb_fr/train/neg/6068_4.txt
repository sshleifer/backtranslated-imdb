Vodka Lemon is an Arminian film both charming and extremely irregular that will delight and annoys others. Although reasonably well designed, the film has no real "zing", but relies on many scenes that seem trivial to a clever spectator. The film contains some moments of pure cinematic brilliance. Unfortunately, they deserve a movie worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and too light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many disoriented and ultimately unhappy views. You may laugh, but these moments will be rare between a sea of ​​snowy landscapes and snow and a series of endless bus journeys. A noble effort, finally realized by lack of narrative cohesion.
