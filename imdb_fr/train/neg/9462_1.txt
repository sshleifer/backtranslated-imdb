Inappropriate. The PG rating this film gets is another huge misstep from the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents are not fooled, taking a child to primary school in this movie is a big mistake. I have often felt uncomfortable not only because the humor was inappropriate for the children, but also because it was totally unexpected and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and the overall appearance of the film are the only saving grace. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always friendly (or hated in this case) Alec Baldwin both have good roles, even if Preston is almost too good for a role like this. Children are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Ventilation is the only human aspect of the film that allowed me to watch and not to throw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I did not like him as Shrek's voice and I really now believe that Myers should never be allowed to play in children's cinema again. His portrait of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if for a day he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes personal anger and quarrels. <br /> <br /> Cat in the Hat is perhaps the worst children's movie of all time.
