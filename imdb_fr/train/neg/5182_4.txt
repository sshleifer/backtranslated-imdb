Like most festival entries, Hamiltons is an interesting watch. It's a film that has all its ideas and its small execution. Although impressive for its obvious budget, the film wobbles in its final turn and becomes terribly long when stretched and its conclusion is obvious. The film tells the story of a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after the death of their parents. They kidnap people, extract blood and feed something locked in their basement. Mckellhar and Firgens have done great humorous performances, and the rest is not great. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing elsewhere. But for the first half, it's an oddly humorous and dark mix that's a surprising achievement. The next half is not so successful that it goes into oblivion with unrealistic twists and turns into a ridiculously arrogant finale that turns the entire movie into shit. It's a shame, but there is no doubt that some talents have been involved in this production and, although deeply flawed, it remains original and creative. pity that the delivery is completely failing at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
