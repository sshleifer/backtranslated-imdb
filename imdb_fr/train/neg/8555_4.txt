It's a very old, inexpensive movie - a typical B-Western that's low budget in many ways. Gary Cooper was not a star yet and this movie is a strong reminder of John Wayne's early films that were shot for "poverty" studios. With both actors, their familiar style and personality were not yet fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like that of Cooper a few years later (among others, he speaks faster in this old movie). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the average film of B At the time, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you want to see the married woman at Errol Flynn for seven years, you have a chance. Lili Damita is the star of female love and it is a very strange casting choice, because she has a strong accent (she was French) and was not even close to being a "pretty movie star" . Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and weirdest aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subplot, much like a 1930s BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (and we thought it was a new idea). The character of Gary Cooper was raised by two men who hate women and do everything in their power during most of the film to keep Cooper away from women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues in the film that the film's writers really tried to describe them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot an arrow and holds the dead long enough to crawl to the body of his deceased friend, then falls, arms tight around him. him! It was a pretty edgy thing for the time and I think it makes this film dull really fascinating today! As for Cooper and the plot, the movie is a little disappointing and very easy to avoid. Unless you are curious about Damita or homosexual nuances, do yourself a favor and find a better western.
