A little perfect atrocity ... I doubt that one shot lasted more than 4.4 seconds, while the reglamentary-MTV. An awful cast, worse than in Kusminsky's version (reminder: he managed to mishandle Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. Heathcliff, dark and brooding, reduced to the state of angel, frail and angelic, Catherine presents herself as a chubby, melon-skinned chest, a sweet and weak Linton is a voyeur, and the innocent Isabel becomes the character of Sara Michelle-Gellar in Cruel Intentions. . Eddie Bauer, 15, and Abercrombie and Fitch Donner - take note. This thing was made for you. It's an hour and a half music video where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even the initial shock caused by their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said earlier, they were badly treated. Decent photography, but editing is at the level of television production class in high school. I implore you all: read the book, or even the cliff notes; look at previous versions, even those of Kusminsky; but stay away from the many future reruns where you will not get the benefit of the first ad-free.
