These excuses for a movie do not concern absolutely anything! Rachel Griffiths needed this money. The film must have been made with a very small budget because the lighting was non-existent. I made a vow, if I ever see Pete Postlesumthing or whatever, I will kill myself. I would be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is having lost my time looking at this garbage.
