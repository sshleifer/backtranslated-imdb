I was so excited and excited to watch this movie when the specials were released for the first time in November! It looked great and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! It's a film that weaves 6 couples. It has a multiple distribution of 12 people! A lot of stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, did not handle the situation well and should not have had many people in this film because it would have made it easier for him. "Salaam-e-Ishq" is far behind the premiere of Nikhil's director Kalh-Naa Ho. I think Nikhil should have a smaller cast of stars. I think the best factors of this movie are the songs! The songs are great and I think all the songs are great, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did a great job over the years. I think the ratings of this movie might increase because of the great songs! One thing that disappointed me was that the director should not have included nudity in this film that is made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found it extremely rude to watch this as a family! Although some may find this nudity as a comedy, it's not something you would want to watch with parents! I think the best acting game has been played by Salman and Priyanka. Overall, I think it's a good movie!
