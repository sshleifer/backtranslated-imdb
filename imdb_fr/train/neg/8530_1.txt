"Her Cardboard Lover" is Norma Shearer's latest film. She left the cinema and, I think, joined MGM's board of directors. It was a good move from him. "Her cardboard lover" was talkative and boring in some parts. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors with speaking parties, so they had a lot of dialogue to talk about in order to keep this turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea of ​​a rich woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to make his playboy boyfriend (George Sanders) jealous. I'm surprised that the director, George Cukor, did not cut a lot of crazy scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in "The Women" but not in this film. <br /> <br /> The best performance of the film was given by Robert Taylor. During his career, Taylor received his best comedy roles in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in "Her Cardboard Lover" and, until then , his best dramatic performance. in "Johnny Eager". He had a busy year. I think of all the MGM actors, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses of the group. In addition, MGM gave Taylor all the types of films to be made - most of them were successful. That's why MGM kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialist heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, "The Women", and gave him the best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her young leaders in "Her Cardboard Lover". In addition, the fact that some of his clothes are awful did not help. <br /> <br /> Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not shoot a film as dramatic as their latest film, the beautiful "Escape". The same comments about this film may be made from another film, "Personal Property," which Mr. Taylor did in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talkative, boring and the actress looked old. Mrs. Harlow looked sick all the way through the movie and no one in Hollywood noticed telling him to see a doctor. In 1937, she died at the age of 26. Such a waste! She became a good actress and got better roles.
