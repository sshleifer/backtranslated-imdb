I watched 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had an impact on me. <br /> <br /> I watched several documentaries about him. He's obviously a smart man, with a great knowledge of movies and a passion to make them, but does that make him a good director. Definitely no! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary thanks to the features mentioned above, but a movie with actors ?? never! <br /> <br /> He can neither direct nor write. His scripts are full of ill-conceived situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and badly done that they can in no way be hidden behind the word "art". No way. Not to mention the awkward direction, so amateurish. To say that he wants to run like that and write shit like that is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene where Scheitz is stopped and where Storszek is hiding in the back of the shop. WHO IS IT CHILD? <br /> <br /> He is a cheater; he knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he has to put in the script to get your attention and praise. No matter the rest of the script and the sloppy direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a film like Medem, then I could double check his old movies and try to find talent.
