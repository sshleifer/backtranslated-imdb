In short, this film is worth absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a film from the point of view of what someone in the early twentieth century might think of the future. An interesting idea, but the absence of history or convincing characters prevents us from suspending our disbelief. The idea has completely failed. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the whole film was shot with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed. But as a graphic designer, the over-softening was an obvious ball to hide the difficult problem of the green edge with green filtering. The color is strongly faded without any significant effect, except to reduce the visual quality. And I do not understand why anyone would think that everything that is rendered in this film is really innovative. On the contrary, ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics - they are not up to the old Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, simple and very unconvincing. There was a bunch of weird animals from prehistory on this island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible beyond belief. In fact, I can not believe I did not come out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and throughout the film is based on mistrust and disappointment. Why is the character of Morris Paley even there? We are in no way convinced that Joe is heroic - I mean he's flying a plane and saved someone (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time on the screen, so why are we supposed to care about Joe who wants to save him? Who were the Nepalese who locked Joe and Polly in the mine chest and why would they do it (remembering that Operation Totenkopf was entirely robotic)? <br /> <br /> Field Holes: (a major fall of his excellent character in "The Crow") stop the robots that had captured Joe? They were looking for the flasks and had not found them. (2) Why the devil Dex would be captured but not killed (he is not aware of the bottles, and the bad guys did not know that Polly had the bottles and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly says "they" do not know anything about Totenkopf, while she has a secret source on him that contains what seems to be a fairly complete file in the FBI style. (4) The white spot on the map as described by the Nepalese - if they know everything about this mysterious region, then why is their map empty there? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - Joe gets new clothes identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear a very voluminous and very strange dress, then in the same continuity, Polly found her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far am I supposed to change my mind to look at this shit? <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be excited about the music produced in surplus, even if nothing interesting or exhilarating happens on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And the acting game? We are supposed to be impressed by a series of bad British accents? Which character is not boring? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best of all the movie (she does not have a single line). The dialogue was not camp and did not even go up to the cheese level. It's just bad and boring. These people are not heroes or convincing; they are the kind of people you would like to ignore or dissociate with if you had the misfortune to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb. IMHO, he should be competing with "Batman Forever" in the last 100 of all time.
