It is curious to note that the two stars of Meet The People were two stars of the cinema who launched themselves in the new support of the television and knew an even greater success. They both entered the production and took advantage of the status of tycoon on the small screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not a major star, who would come with television. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to stop making films such as Meet The People and his career would be the subject of salvation in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the film is because A young MGM player was selected in a special issue and he saw it at the time. Her private time with June Allyson was much better than what we see on the screen. Powell seems bored and can not emit emotion. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of doing these musicals with stupid intrigues, the kind he had directed from Warner Brothers. The original show Meet The People was not an exhibition of books, but a magazine. It was presented for 160 seasons on Broadway during the 1940-1941 season. When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything except the title and title track. The rest of the score has been patched by several songwriters, none of the songs are memorable. Bizarre to consider that some of the source documents come from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just have to empty the trunk for the equipment. <br /> <br /> The plot is more stupid than even most pieces of musical propaganda of the time. Powell is the author of Meet The People magazine and a shipyard worker who wins a lottery appointment with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, they are both interested in the magazine, but the creative differences separate them of course until the final. It's the film in a few words. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball good musical numbers that are the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr, wearing a commodore costume like Lou Costello in the dream sequence of In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number of The Wizard Of Oz. And as almost everyone has seen this movie, you have an idea of ​​Heave Ho. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet, in which he finally parted to a not so goodbye expensive musicals. And Lucy should wait for television before the whole world can see what she can really do.
