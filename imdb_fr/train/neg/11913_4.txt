A good idea poorly implemented. Although this can sum up 99% of SciFi's movies, this really applies here. I love movies where a good story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies and all the main actors, so that could have been great. However, despite some good acting roles, this film fails because of the bad writing and staging of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another critic emphasized the need to know where you are going so you can get there. This film does not do it. It is so randomly composed that you know that the words "second project" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is a scene that is completely useless and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene begins and ends even with the driving of a car. So you can go from one car scene to another and never miss a useless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film also had the strange habit of under explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" in advance. He was also used to aborting an early fight, probably just because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculous scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving a well placed "poisonous adhesive" (seriously, what is * that?). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's okay. She manages to get out of her character "Roswell" a few times and makes a good girlfriend hard (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he played in everything he's done since returning from Q in ST: TNG, so it's not new. <br /> <br /> In total, I gave this film a rating of 4/10.
