This is another of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cats that kill to live, etc. - a kind of variation of the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes everything crumble is the total carelessness of the main characters. . Even sociopaths know that you have to be discreet if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch Unibomber, and that's because a family member understood it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the child (and to a lesser extent, the mother) behave as if they were untouchable. The child kills without thinking not to leave evidence, traces or live witnesses. How these people managed to stay alive and discover for a month is amazing, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's a shame - it could have been a lot more if it had been written in a plausible way, that is, to give the main characters the level of common sense they needed for so long. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not a bad performance. I loved the moment all the cats in town converge on the house - every time I put food on the porch and I see our cats rushing to where they were before, I think of that scene.
