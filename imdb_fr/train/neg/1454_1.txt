I recently watched this movie twice and I can not understand why the creators made this pile of shit. I mean, yes, it gives a good impression of the Hitlerian environment and the way in which they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, the First World War and the interwar period. What I do not understand is why they described Hitler as a 100% pure monster, completely crazy, unreliable and mentally unstable. He was, after all, a very thoughtful, affectionate and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark side, there is no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven to portray it this way? All its positive aspects were excluded from the scenario, leaving only a portrait very similar to the propaganda of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was racist and yes, he was sometimes unstable from the point of view of life, especially at the end of the war. All true. But; why the hell did they lie to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis lies in the fact that they were able to seize power in the event of serious global weakness. The fact that this evil is so recognizable and yet so embraced by almost all living Germans (not to mention the Austrians and MANY other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was a "crazy ". If it had been as the decision makers have us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were delayed. A man like this movie would never have approached the leader of the party - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
