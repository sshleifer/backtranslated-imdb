After we stopped at the movies to find something to watch, we stumbled upon that. It seemed appealing at least from the summary, so we tried. And here is the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's truly pleasent! Oh, wait, talk too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere over there, the film took a disgusting turn to become a fundamental brainwashing among right-wing Christians. I'm not quite sure what will happen, but I think the screenwriter found God somewhere out there, finished writing this script and did not have time to revise it because he had a KKK meeting to go with his friends from Westboro Church. not clean. <br /> <br /> Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. A bit like video games have filing systems, movies need a kind of symbol: maybe a little cross in the lower corner to show us that a movie will deteriorate. <br /> <br /> Unless you share. Feelings with any idiot have written this story and will have your Bible open on your lap as you watch this and plan how you will convert your neighbors, do not waste your time. This is one of the worst garbage that has appeared for a long time, and the radical religious fools no longer need funding.
