It's a very strange film ... I did not know what was going on, some shipwrecked Londoners find a dumb kid in the woods, which they all see as a kind of oracle and who makes them all way. , change something in their life that usually ends in disaster. The film ended in about 90 minutes, which left me rather dissatisfied, almost annoyed by the uselessness of it all. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them have the chance to be loved by the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I weak? It was so strange. What happens to the runner? Why is Emilio pulling on the child? ... it made no sense, useless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of a movie?
