Unless you are petrified by Russians or wild boars, this movie is a snoring. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to leave the theater. I would like to have. A mess of a Saturday night perfectly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was more scary. Heck, even "Pan's maze" was more scary. I still do not understand what was supposed to be scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, I'm very suspicious of movies that use the "Russian pidgin" as it was in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all collapsed. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Fortunately for me (and probably for you too), this movie has already escaped my mind and I just came out an hour ago. So, I have no details, just gloomy visuals that go nowhere and a languid hope now dead that something will happen. <br /> <br /> I may have seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe it I had such good reviews here (that's why I saw it) and ended up being completely devoid of horror or suspense, but also of global value for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and I did not leave.
