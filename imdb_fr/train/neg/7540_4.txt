The Wicker Man, with Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can not really say that it is a film that I regret to watch. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the film, like the terrible actor and the long scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a sequence of dreams - with a hallucination etc. But there is no need to expand on a film like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you MUST watch The Wicker Man, even if it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that she has really scary ideas, the only one problem is its clumsy and fun performance. If it's nothing else, it's a film that can make you see the original 1973 movie or even read the news it's based on. <br /> <br /> 4. For a thriller / cheese thriller, it's really aesthetic. It is quite obvious that the film was shot on the spot instead of using a green screen or elaborate sets. We can see very beautiful landscapes. There are also many well composed plans. It's a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of him or not, it seems impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". He always brings a kind of eccentricity or nervousness to the characters he plays, and personally, I'm always fascinated to watch him in every film he makes. Whether Nicolas Cage is big or terrible, he always puts his unique energy on the line and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write an article about this film, which seems to be the most powerful anti-feminist film ever made. "See?" you can write "this is what happens when women are allowed to run a company!" In addition, the similarities between this "Summersisle" company and a colony of bees are quite interesting and worthy of note. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you've seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" of the movie, including Cage ran into a bear costume, and of course, the famous "AAGHH !! BEES !! MY EYES !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context and remain quite amusing when you look at them in their entirety. <br /> <br /> I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you get out it's about a dollar a reason. It's a very good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unrated version of the film is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the theatrical version just for its small addition to the epilogue, which features a James Franco cameo.
