I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), otherwise it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets for the free projection, but it was still not worth it, nor my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that older people have a past before becoming old (no kidding). The life of the main characters was painful to watch, one generation no better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did their best with a lame story. I have always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I write this review to thwart the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
