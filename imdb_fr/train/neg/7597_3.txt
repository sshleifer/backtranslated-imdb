I love the representation of the 30s and 40s in a movie. I like Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No sir, nothing good about it. The only entertaining aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell, unsafe writer, and this scenario, despite the treatment of the juicy subject of racism, addresses the audience in the manner of an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> It did not seem that his role was "Sutherland", and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> The obsolete approach of a tired plot.
