This is the official sequel to the 1992 science fiction action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among several veterans who died in the Vietnam War who had regained their status as perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, I guess it's about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a girl of that age. Now he is collaborating with the government in a facility classified to form the latest Unisols - under the code name Unisol 2500, for whatever reason. As usual, something is wrong: the on-site supercomputer (named Seth - like the snake in "King Cobra" the same year) goes crazy with power, takes command of the Unisols and even downloads his brain. computer in a new super-solid body (Jai White). We are looking for a new stage in evolution! Most of Van Damme's fights take place with a particularly naughty Unisol (professional wrestler Goldberg) that just keeps coming: let go of a building - nothing good; crush it with a truck - no! Shoot him, burn him, forget him! Much of the humor is due to the fact that Van Damme is now obsolete and outclassed (he has even turned gray at the edges). But, even if he gets licked, he continues to kick! Most sequels of this type are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and although it's certainly not a stroke of genius, it still manages to be entertaining, especially if you're a wrestling fan.
