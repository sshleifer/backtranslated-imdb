I do not know what this other comment was talking about. It's certainly not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think there was a decent girl looking. No, this is just Ed Wood-style sci-style schlock bad and lame. And it's bad. I can not even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw him late on the cable and I was shocked. The fact that this film was never released is an insult to us all. The actors were either producer's friends or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke and the pace is incredibly slow. For me though, the music is at the top. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on a cable, look at it. You will be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
