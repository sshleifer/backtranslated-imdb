The only quality that buys this very long miscast melodrama is the landscape of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri who sings the theme song. Stephanie Powers is a bad idea and betrayed by a bogus accent. As has been pointed out, she is too old to play a young 18 year old and looks much too young as a grandmother with a college-age granddaughter. Lee Remick is good, although she is also ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is underused and also manages to look young when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries his grandmother Stephanie Powers. The constant arrogance of Stacey Keach makes you wonder what these women saw in him. I do not know how a spectator could relate to his excessive representation? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It is hard to believe that the beautiful suitors of this epic would remain single while they patiently wait for the subject of their affections to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that the beautiful Robert Urich would remain single for decades until Stephanie Powers finally accepts her endless marriage proposals? The commitment of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with, the Germans occupied France only in Provence until the end of the war; they were under the control of the French puppet government of Vichy. We see the French resistance organizing a raid in the light of day in the villa Mistral to steal sheets, after which all bask under a bridge until a truckload of Nazi soldiers is surprised and annihilated? If you want to see a well played mini-series unfold in a foreign country, do not look at Mistral's daughter. Thorn Birds are a much better alternative.
