A really scary movie. One gets the impression that this was done in the early 90's by a righteous person who wanted to show that homosexuals are good, normal people who aspire to the mainstream. Downgraded to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way of salvation for sad, lonely and crazy gays. Wow! Who knew? The secondary characters are caricatures of homosexual stereotypes (the effeminate jester, the bitter and lonely queen, the fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast clones, middle-class, average-minded, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Regarding the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple, there is not much to say: we have already seen everything and we have done a lot better.
