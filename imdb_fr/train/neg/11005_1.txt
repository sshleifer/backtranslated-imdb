This film shows a series of sketches that partly pass in the other. I realized the end of the movie later in the film. At first it just irritated me. <br /> <br /> Most of the episodes of this film unfold without any recognizable landmarks and simply try to circumvent this fact, using nonsense and obscenity. The attempt of this one to remain comic without funny nonsense fails. <br /> <br /> My staff and maybe a subjective result after watching this movie (God, it hurts my head every time I call it "movie"): A bold attempt to transform nothing in anything big. But it failed. At least the director did something from scratch. But that's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many movies have not been as fun as expected, but this one surpasses them all. This is the real manifestation of the worst scenario of making a movie. No, to correct me, it's even worse than that. A movie with gags so bad that they are not funny at all. It's not even fun to watch the main actor, the writer and the director (all three identical), perish by drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The film is too bad for that.
