What the viewers will remember most is the headache given them by the film because of the very flashy, shaky film, the work of the camera and the fast and confusing cut. I am not against such stylistic devices if they are well done, as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh prove with most of their films, but in this case, there was too much way. It seems as if the light jumps and lightning that accompanied each flight over Mexico City and every important scene were there to prevent you from realizing that the story is thin enough and everything is very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily understand how it's going to end. For a film that claims to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that its story has been told so often and with much more depth and development of character. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to watch an action movie, I do not need any justification, but this movie has tried to justify the murderous madness of the character of Denzel Washington and has failed badly in achieving credible performances. The first half hour or so, nothing happens except that silent archetypes and clich√©s are shown and when the action machine starts to roll, it is cut off so quickly that you do not know what's going on Actually. So the film does not work at the level of a credible drama / thriller, nor as a pure action movie. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the totally messed-up blockbusters of the last few years, but I can not understand why so many people claim that this movie is cool and so cool. It's too long for a video clip and too little for a movie.
