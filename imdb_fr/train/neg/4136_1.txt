I read the reviews before watching this movie and I did not believe them. I like shit movies and I expected it to be average. It was not. This film gives Camp Blood 1 and 2 the great looks. The film contains a bad acting, a mediocre sound, a mediocre and confused scenario, a bad makeup - and it bothers me so much that I turned it off. even nakedness was nil! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did it. You can tell if you will like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want a good gore cheese movie go watch Toxic Avenger 4 or even some camp blood. Avoid these trash - I watched them on TV and felt ripped off, so do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
