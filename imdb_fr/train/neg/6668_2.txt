The longer the film lasted - and it seemed to last forever - the more I became bored, as it was quite frankly, what a waste of time if I passed to this total absurdity. How can people make movies like this, or even receive funding for such waste? Do not rely on the relatively high ratings on IMDb, it proves that you can always fool certain people. And in this picture, the main actors are obsessed with firearms, so it is not difficult to determine how this film will unfold. The United States can never understand that the rest of the world finds it odd that "gun culture" is so obscene and so fatal in American society. <br /> <br /> Anyway: <br /> <br /> The main actor depicts a loser who escapes into a fantastic world of cowboys in urban sprawl. He meets a family with two spoiled spoiled children, a teenager and a boy; cared for by a strict single father who can barely cope. The cowboy is seduced by the teenager or vice versa, and the impressionable boy is apparently seduced by the madness of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all his time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work to live, then commits a burglary on his family because he is too lazy to earn money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to watch is a sad loser missed in an imaginary world holding a vow of death, or see a poor family that is actually hardly better than the white basket ?! <br /> <br /> This film is useless drivel. <br /> <br /> This only avoids getting the lowest possible note with half-hearted music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
