Director Sidney J. Furie has created at Hollow Point a post-modern absurd masterpiece that constantly challenges and surprises audiences. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired paradigms of the traditional classicism of "plot" and "characterization" when you remove the crutches of "motivation" and "reason" ". <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion about it could not be higher. <br /> <br /> A star and a half. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this film makes sense, law enforcement officers are unimaginable and organized criminals are overflowing with madness.
