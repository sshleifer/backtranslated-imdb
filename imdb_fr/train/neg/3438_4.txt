The haunted boat is sold as "fog" meets "open water". In many ways, that is correct. There are fears and strange people looking to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the ability to act is at best mediocre. This clearly shows that this is only a group of friends making a horror movie. Which in all credit they do to the best of their abilities. When you accept the low budget, the special effects are very difficult, ghosts very much like men wearing a rubber mask. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are lugubrious and strange. But he suffers from having used too many twists in a short period of time, which leaves you bored and confused. To keep you awake, the movie does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant twist every 5 seconds towards the end, you really want to know what's going on. And are ready to wait 1:35 for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship, but you will certainly do it for a party in front of the T.V.
