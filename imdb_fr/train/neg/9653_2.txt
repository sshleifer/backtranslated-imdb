Make sure you have tons of popcorn to consume for the time until the end of the movie. laptop your cellphone this film can be easily used in a restaurant, but of course not in a theater. My dog ​​who is always next to my family when he watches a movie has left the building. What is certain is that this film is about people This movie can only be used to watch it by making a shopping list at the supermarket.
