This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst film. The first part takes place with a solid comedy of Goundamani, but it gradually worsens and becomes totally illogical. Our hero is also interested in the Saints of the same name (Baba) through a lame and totally lame one-liner. In the first half, Rajni stating his usual style of mannequins and in the second half, becomes a quasi-saint after a beggar has led him through an interdimensional portal of the Himalayas, where Babaji him special powers for no reason apparent (other than karma). It's really starting to become interesting now, is not it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about him wasting his magical benefits and powers and fighting against politicians and the dark magic associated with them. The usual predictable shit with hilarious implementation. Oh, and black magic never worked on our hero because he had just had a Param Vir ... uh ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the bad politicians are clich√©s, overloaded and ultimately insignificant for the plot that itself goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the faults, it was fun to waste time with and shout Baba's one-liners at public events. It's also fun to watch others curse about this movie. AR Rehman would have composed the tracks of his film via his mobile phone. It's very important to him. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and it has included two characters (one is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this film just for the pleasure of doing it . But the way they are described, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after seeing this. This film was probably promotional material for Rajni entering politics, but the results of the film itself would not have killed any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you close your brain.
