In my bed. class, we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian has never eaten worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) Her mother was cheating on her father in a family car not located in the woods where no one could see. (4) The man with whom the mother cheats does not have black hair, he has blond hair. <br /> <br /> Now, for the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) A thirteen year old can not hit his fist through a window at once. <br /> <br /> And for the actors' game, the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the landscape was impressive, although I doubt very much that the director even read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you have not read the Hatchet book, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a complaint letter to the director.
