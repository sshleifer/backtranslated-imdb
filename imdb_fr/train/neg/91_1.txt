I rented this movie about 3 years ago and it remains in my memory the worst movie of all time. I do not think I've ever finished it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember going back in 1970 and there was a man with a polo, Oakley sunglasses and a new SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something like that (I do not remember ). I do not understand how they could have said that in the '70s. He might also have had a cell phone, I do not remember, it was horrible. I sent him back to the video store and asked them why they were even carrying the movie and if I could recover the time of my life. To date, it's the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some really bad ones.
