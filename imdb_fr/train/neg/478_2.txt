The competition for Warner Bros. Kay Francis's worst film is tough. I may have seen only eight, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing about this is that it's short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly's dresses (of course) are fine. The cinematography of James Wong Howe is not. Kay Francis always looks fat and much less attractive than she usually does. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know by the way, is a good semi-hard burlesque dancer (it was more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The Last Plan - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was his mother, did I go to sleep?) Walking on a dirt road to a prison painted in Misty contours on a sound stage is very ridiculous. All the film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that he feels infected by a sour cynicism from all those who shot him: Warner Bros throwing garbage at dolts who do not know, according to the Cynical estimate of Warner Bros, what they get is garbage.
