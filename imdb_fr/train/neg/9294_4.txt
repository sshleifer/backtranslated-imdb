As a person amazed by the incredible graphics of "Hero", I was eager to see this film presented as going in the same direction, but better. There was also an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both sides. I bought the DVD of this invisible movie, and it was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these aerial martial arts films are purely fanciful, but this story stretches so far that anything credible has made me shake my head with disappointing disbelief. A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it's a bit far. In addition, the main character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so boring by his dialogue, his silly look and his stupid laugh, that he also ruined the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the magnificent colors and incredible action scenes, this story - for me - did not have the slightest appeal to make a movie worthy of being owned. This film is not my "hero"!
