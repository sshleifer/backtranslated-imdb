Today, Bea Arthur passed away, so I surfed the IMDb website and found myself on the show "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a brilliant show during his first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once. However, I swear I did not know there was a show called "Gloria". Maybe it's a good thing. It may mean that I had a young adult life rather than watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the franchise "All In The Family" has deteriorated so much that it has spawned show I have never heard of - and the one who is very badly noted by previous critics. <br /> <br /> I rated the show a 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to record a no vote and screenwriters and television executives should be sentenced for starting a a show that has no serious business and marks the memory of one of the greatest shows in the history of television. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
