The Irish criticism of this film is beyond me. Overworked by the usual group of Irish actors dragged for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with forced character quirks (brown sauce). Romantise all that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of "ah, it's a slum but it sure is not great anyway." Many treats purely for the American public (the boss of the supermarket and his horribly forced slogan). And the nail in the coffin was the character of Colm Meaney. A great actor forced to play this role that could have been written by a five-year-old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell and it's a pain when you have to say it. Well, at least he did not put his terrible American accent. International audiences, be warned: stay home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. The entrance is an outdoor step
