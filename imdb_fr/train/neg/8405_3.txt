Before seeing this film, I was expecting a fictional drama loosely based on the book's ideas; it is rather the book, interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating the different "diseases". It did not bother me much, but it did bother my pleasure watching the movie. A story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book intermingled in the film would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you want to base a movie on a psychology text, you need to find a more interesting (and preferably precise) text than this one. The film hangs during passages where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of sexual psychology of the nineteenth century and would be quite intolerable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, several stories about the development of the characters lead us. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality have not been questioned for the most part. I hoped he would use stories to show how imperfections from his archaic perspective on psychology are still prevalent to this day. <br /> <br /> So what do you have? A detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of some "sexual deviants" before they are healed. During most of the film, the film moves with the creeping speed (and mood) of a wake. And, as a low-budget film, cinematography and acting are not really first rate. Although * I was * satisfied with music, costumes and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the subject of this film was for me quite up to my expectations and I still think it is a film below average. He deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt extremely generous. I can not imagine anyone taking advantage of this if he is not already interested in sexual fetishism.
