Of course, I like short cartoons, but I did not like this one. Naturally, kids would love that. But again, I am no longer a child (even if I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is it possible that this cartoon dragon was nominated for an Oscar ?! Well ... I guess it's because people in the 30's were happier with nothing more than now. In the present where we live, everything must happen quickly. Watch movies nowadays and you'll come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to slow down. It's a shame. I would have liked to live in the 30s, because it seems so peaceful. But each time has its ups and downs, I guess ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you will have to see this drawing. Otherwise, do not waste your time on it.
