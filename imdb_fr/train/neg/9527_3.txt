I tried to find this film just by looking for bad sentences on the words "teenagers seduce and kill the man in his house", etc. I think I saw part of this movie when I was about 10 when it was running on a cable. It made quite an impression! This is the kind of movie that kids know they should not watch and change channels when their parents come on the scene. When I saw who the cast was, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. . Again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives being murdered, then this is an interesting movie. Moreover, if I remember correctly, there are some interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the stupidest end of all time, but still ... memorable.
