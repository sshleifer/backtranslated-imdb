I felt really bad for the actors of this thing. There is no doubt that a high school theater class could do a better job or at least a job as well. The actors must have thought that it would be their chance to work in a movie, it certainly was not the case. In addition to the dramatic game, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. The one on the remote did not even make sense. This is a bad cause. This is the best premise of the pack. <br /> <br /> I am very much in favor of supporting low-budget films and giving a chance to new directors, the viewer. I only watched it because of good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with links to the film. You can deceive people by looking at this, but you can not deceive them by loving what they have seen. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to make my heart feel warm. Of course, he failed miserably, but he tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I would like to have.
