I saw the trailer of this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the acting game is a disaster, the special effects (if you could call them that) look like something that would not be moved to a play at school. Some characters are so stupid in this movie that you will not be able to get noticed the minute they appear on the screen, which is unfortunately too often. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, do not waste money on this movie at all, it must be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie, watch it on Troll 2, you will surely enjoy it too.
