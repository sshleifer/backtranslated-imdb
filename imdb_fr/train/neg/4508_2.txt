Andrewjlau, I totally agree. My girlfriend is looking at this right now and I find this film appalling. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend laughing: "They do all this for a man !?" <br /> <br /> I find that these women have no intensity, that they have no sense of the struggle between tragedy and identity and that these men are not worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them, the men look more stupid than admired. <br /> <br /> The Japanese have a lot more intensity than the Chinese, and being geisha is a Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces did not match those of the main version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so mysterious, so American. If a European had done it with Eastern Europeans, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I must add: it seems that most people who liked the movie are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything is stated for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are charming, but I can not say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is excellent, but really, I do not see how one can see that these characters are complex and deep individuals. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
