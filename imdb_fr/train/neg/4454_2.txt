At first a little background; I am English and I have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games at Den and most other club grounds in London. I am very familiar with the type of people who engage in hooliganism, and I know how they act and how they speak. I must say it's a bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the film with embarrassing shame. I thought I would write a mini-critique because I needed to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> a) People simply do not speak like that in London in real life; the filmmakers pushed the slang too far and made it stupid. Unfortunately, the types of thugs exist, but the ones you see in Green Street look more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) has unfortunately sounded like "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. He's from north Newcastle and I'm just surprised that one of the other actors can stand up straight to him - how can we take him seriously? Why they did not just ask someone from East London to play this role exceeds me. I could have managed on my own, hehe. (c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I expect Elijah Wood to take seriously asshole the ass of people twice his size and who are really bad thugs? He would be dead. As simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit), it was hard to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will explode here in the UK. It may be a little better in the United States, because Americans just do not know (or worry) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but they are extremely underground and on a very small scale. The film only pays me 2 because they filmed a part of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something like that and expect us not to notice that.
