I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I've only seen a handful (and none of the "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th") - but I can enjoy a scary horror movie not because of gore. And I'm sure it's not scary. <br /> <br /> Why a little plastic skull that appears everywhere? In all his appearances, there are distant established shots, so there is no surprise in this film. (This is not a scary skull anyway, but ..) <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the third cousin of Claus von Bulow (John Hudson), who marries a look-alike reed (Peggey Webber, one of the worst performances in her history) who begins to see skulls and hear the mysterious cries of a group of peacocks in her husband's house. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and / or make his wife crazy. If you want to see a good version of this material, try "Reversal of Fortune". In addition, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MST was ok but nothing special; paired with the "Gumby" shorts, however, it's good to watch. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
