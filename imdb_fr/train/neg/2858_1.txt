It must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were terrible, the acting was B-movie and the effects were just perfect for Nintendo 64. You would think they would put a little more effort. Of course, this is a film broadcast on the Scifi channel, so we must expect it to be inexpensive, but this one takes the cake. Damn it, I'm still laughing. So, like a film that shakes your head in the film of disbelief, this one is doing well. <br /> <br /> Although there seems to be some "known" actors and actresses in this field, it's hard to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film was worth their while. time and their efforts. <br /> <br /> The graphics may have been good in the '60s or even the early' 70s, but it's 2009! I will not reveal anything to spoilers, but if you played at "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you will be very aware of what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's definitely not worth it, we had to sit through the thing
