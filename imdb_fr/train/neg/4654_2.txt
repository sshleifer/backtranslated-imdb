A vampire woman kills young women and paints with their blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he must do what she commands him or be turned into a bloodsucker. After a few murders, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That its rhythm is too slow, that it has strange sound effects (never a mouthful was so strange) and an atmosphere (new jazz here I come) and that the lights do not seem to be included in the decoration. It looks like a horror movie "author" with all its autonomy. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can guess, it's the vampire who explains how to kill her even if she does not. no need to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> This is not even a funny ugly movie. Maybe with friends and a lot of beers, he can not have his funny sides (to be honest, it's funny for 10-15 minutes towards the end of the movie). Do not trust the Troma sticker, this is one of the bad movies they present.
