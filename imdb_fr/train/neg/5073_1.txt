The teasers of Tree of Palme try to convey this as a kind of allegory for a fairy tale with a real sense, then immediately start raving about the animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the problem of the whole movie. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psychopath with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he has already taken care of. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, Palme is ill-defined. You do not bond with the characters at all, although Shatta has some fans. It seems that the writer is more interested in integrating all the drama and complexity possible in this film than in exploring the motivations and personalities of his characters. minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to rationalize his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help wondering if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited to a television series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie, I just could not stand the lack of quality anymore and do not care how the characters, relationships and plot were invented. I touched my companion and he started to crack too, as well as a young man sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we just could not enjoy the terrible quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is incredible, and the spectators will admire the lush backgrounds and the charming character. drawings. The animation almost guides you; when you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
