Except that people apparently buy in this trash! As shows such as "Moral Orel" show, even if you tried to make the most scandalous and exaggerated parody of evangelization you can think of, it would not be close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to tell what's going on even when you look at it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They begin to report on various international reports, but at seemingly random times, the news is interrupted by this strange little troll-like man, his forehead bigger than his face, muttering and laughing and usually scary. <Br /> <br /> At first glance, Pat Robertson does not even seem to be such a mean man. He looks like an old man, yet harmless, stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who called for an assassination, who befriended and offered his help not to one, but to TWO deadly dictators who illegally used donations to exploit diamond mining, which has supported forced abortions in China and regularly implies that Caucasians (American heterosexual Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, all that would be funny, except that he apparently has a fan base large enough for his little show to air 40 years later (that is, enough money to bribe leaders of television that make fun of what they show). The idiocy of the series becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, have to watch it and hang on to every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he is, people are still listening to him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mix of both.
