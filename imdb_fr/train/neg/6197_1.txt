At the end of the film, I asked myself, "Is this the worst movie I've ever seen or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... In fact, after seeing this film and thinking a little about its meaning, you do not find any meaning and you can only remember the two scenes of rape, incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to put this question in the head of the crowd: "What are these crimes compared to the horror of war and extermination?" because I noticed that the two terrible scenes were directly related to the war and its horrors (in the first scene, you can see here the raped girl who screams and at the same time, you hear one of the speeches of President Bush on the need to start a war with Iraq and in the second scene, the images of the three criminals who hold a sword in a woman's vagina are directly followed by archive footage of the Second World War But, in fact, I really could not think of the relative gravity of these two kinds of human horror expression were shocked by what I had just seen and felt (sorry for the bad english).
