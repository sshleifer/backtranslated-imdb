I would not say it's awful, but nothing in this film shines, and it's cluttered with incredibly incredible basic developments. It starts well, but once the main hit is over, it turns into a long-running subplot around a girl who is not convincing, as well as action scenes that are the theater of the absurd unrealistic. For example, there is an extended shootout at the airport in which the lighting is fully stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that an airport storage area produces lights that blink in a confusing way, and just enough to allow Snipes to make its incredible getaway? This is one of the few action scenes punctuated by unnecessarily elaborate developments that simply fail to lead to believe in a suspended conviction. <br /> <br /> In addition, it seems that the entire CIA team can fire on the scene but leave saying "national security" to the British. This gimmick is based on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies. Better formulated, better executed. It's sometimes entertaining, but there's just not enough meat, and after a while, it becomes downright boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
