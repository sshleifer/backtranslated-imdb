It is strange to find that less than two hours can seem like a lifetime when you are sitting in such a flat and uninteresting environment. If a story is as personal as supposedly for Sally Potter, do not you expect a bit of passion in her performance? Her playing was completely detached and I did not feel any chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been inflamed given the nature of the dance, were rather difficult to watch and painful. Obviously, revealing such a personal story in a film can be intimidating, and so Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor do the job than let her passion become the victim of her own foolishness.
