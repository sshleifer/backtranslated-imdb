Interesting movie in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well cast and strangely attractive. She looks like a disorganized Renee Zellweger with bad hair. This girl made only two of these movies and then returned to Texas. The music is terrible. Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) plays one of his friends under a different name. <br /> <br /> The best replica of Tony's movie chicks put me on it. "Good cinematography in black and white of Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others) Good places (cool pool, also used in THE DEFILERS) End strange but ok A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker.
