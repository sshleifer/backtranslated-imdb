It's amazing in its dreadfulness - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> From your point of view, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: since he's the only one on the screen who can really get his stand out with a natural cadence and inflection natural, it destroys the film by highlighting the flaws of all others or it saves it by providing context to their horror. <br /> <br /> I'm inclined to the idea view-- thanks to him, it works like a high comedy. He is the football player in a dwarf basketball game, his skills simply do not apply in this context and his discombobulation is delicious. <br /> <br /> The real treat is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak clear English is so ubiquitous that I googled her, expecting her to know she was a beautiful Russian who pronounced his lines phonetically without understanding their meaning. But no, she's just a talent-free American who will let you laugh with every line she lets go. That she knew what those lines meant was an open question.
