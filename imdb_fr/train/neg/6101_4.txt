Almost a two-part, dialogue and performance of the main roles will be important. Neither are particularly good. It could have been stronger, in fact, if it had first been conceived as a two-person piece and then integrated into a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a nervous vampire who seems slightly autistic is passionate about a stripper (because of watching too much porn in her crappy house). He wants to make her talk about the light of day. It would have been better to find someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting an image with words like a poet, but they may not have the hot body. <br /> <br /> do what he wants (and he is not very good at it), he intends to feed her at 6 o'clock, when the sun rises. This delay is greatly appreciated, even though he also says he can go without food, it will make him even more hungry. In addition, he says he can not let the stripper go, because she knows it, but he lets a number of people go who learn who he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why does this vampire choose to live in a house so ill-fitted that the light from streetlights and neighboring buildings rushes in as if it were daylight, I'm not sure. With all the time spent in the world, you would think he would have done a better job, or repaired the place a bit. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake and I'm curious to see the original version of this movie, Dance of the Damned. Although this was done by Katt Shea, and the other films she made for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
