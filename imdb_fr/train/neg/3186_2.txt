I did not think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a film as bad as his idiot "Mitchell", but this one succeeds. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it if you are a fan of MUCH best job of Joe Don Baker. But, if you like to watch sweaty men and really, really fired by weapons, you'll love this movie.
