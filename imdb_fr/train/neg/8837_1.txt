This film is terrible. I was really looking forward to it because I thought "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, the good things: it's very beautiful, some performances are OK. The bad things are all the rest about it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, is about guys going fishing and discovering a body, with the twist they find it on Friday but keep fishing and report it finally on Sunday when they come back in the mobile range (mobile phone). However, the film takes its time (the boy takes his time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> Of all the characters (about a dozen), none seems to like another (which is, I guess, consistent, because they are all implausible). I was extremely frustrated by the inability to adequately explain how the characters are related, and it was only towards the end of the film that I was able to build the family tree vaguely. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a film that is implacably dark, which is a failure in the story structure, because the character's life seems just as bad before the fishing trip as 'after. Once you have set the bar very high, it is difficult to ensure that not everyone commits suicide. <br /> <br /> There are ridiculous mistakes in logic. The killer throws the body into the lake, then drifts in the mountains. The fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but for some reason, Byrne returns late at night after his wife's bedtime. The next morning, the cops knock on the door to convince him to go down to the police station. Uh, did not they hear about the phone? At the station, the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after reporting the body? <br /> <br /> The debate is completely absent from history: the debate that the guys had after finding the body. It's a mystery - everyone asks them "how can you do that?" and the public asks the same question. (The debate on what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to come to the car, go to the phone, call the cops, wait and guide them to where they are. If the others are waiting at the camp and are fishing, who cares? <br /> <br /> It just seems wrong. The only thing that was right was that, since the girl was black, local people in the area called the racists racist - "they would not have done it if it was a white girl". <br /> <br /> Throughout the year, there is a curious indifference to the murder of the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once), and there is no mystery because the public sees the killer in the opening scene. <br /> <br /> So I sit both bored and confused, when there is a twist - not in the plot, but in the theme. All of a sudden, it is the silent dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ridiculous conclusion with incoherent elements about black-white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film "at its best", according to The Age.
