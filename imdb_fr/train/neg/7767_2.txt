To anyone who is not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book, this film should be interesting. It is colorful, well played and portrays a great adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, it's dreadful. I could not sit across. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screenwriters seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and some episodes would be difficult to film. But why do writers rewrite history instead of just adapting it? In this case, the authors have outdone themselves. <br /> <br /> Some examples: There was no mutiny at the Fame. The officers took the ship after the half-mad captain was utterly insane when he fell into a hatch - for implicit but never given reasons. There was no court martial. The court of inquiry was held in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Colonel Ortega's wife. Hornblower, himself, was never in the brig, neither aboard the ship nor on the ground. The story of Forrester is extensively manipulated. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think that the repeated use of the flashback by the film harms the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh why did the writers ruin a good story?
