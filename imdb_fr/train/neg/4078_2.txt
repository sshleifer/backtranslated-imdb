JESSICA: A ghost story is as its name suggests a ghost story. The theme is supposed to be horror but gets closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this film tries to portray as a plot. There is really nothing more to this. The film includes a series of loosely linked scenes featuring a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Immediately opening scenes, this film has the appearance of a -DVD "effort." Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or the creativity and certainly gives a bad reputation to movies "directly on DVD"! The direction is as poor as possible with a total lack of suspense, fear or tension.Even the elements of drama are irremediably treated and represent something more boring that even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune to last. <br /> <br /> The acting is absolutely catastrophic, no actor involved succeeding to show the slightest potential of a career actor successful. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes are incredibly long and have very long pauses between dialogue exchanges.I do not exaggerate! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give to this film a score of 2 rather than 1, that's because some of the bad actors combined with an even worse dialogue provoked some unintentional laughter. I insist on the word "little" in this sentence. It's not all in all a movie "so bad, it's good" like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch these movies. If you want to see a horror movie about ghosts, check out THE HELL LEGEND HOME, CHANGELING, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, MISSED CALL or TELEPHONE. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has had the chance to avoid seeing JESSICA: A HISTORY OF GHOST to continue its momentum! Forget this movie exists. Do not lose a thought for that!
