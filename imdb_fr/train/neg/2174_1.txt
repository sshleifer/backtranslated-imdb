It's hard to believe that people really like this moron! I think kids can enjoy it, but for me it's the kind of movie that parents can not handle. Predictable intrigue, boring Belushi, and perhaps the worst kid actor of all time. I will give the director some of the child's responsibility, but it was really painful to watch. I feel embarrassed for her now, to let people know it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound. I then came here and found out that they did it because she won Star Search. I always thought that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade the name of his wonderful brother, sadly missed, and this shit shows why. Zero stars.
