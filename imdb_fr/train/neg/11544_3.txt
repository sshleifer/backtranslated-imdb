I was really looking forward to watching this, because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. He then moves quickly to the main plot, that is to say that they are attacked by a group of foreigners and that Dyer is beaten extremely badly while Anderson is raped. They then decide to take revenge. Sounds good, does not it? Well no. The story becomes boring and confused, and some things get really weird. I will not give details, but there are things I do not want to see. I like to give the benefit of the doubt to all movies, and I really wanted to love this one. It just did not work. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
