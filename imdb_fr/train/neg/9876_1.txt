I came in knowing nothing about this movie and I left in half an hour knowing everything. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm usually a nice person, but if someone told me that he loves this movie, I will probably never talk to him again. Anyone who likes him will probably have an extremely dry personality and hermit type. I'll also add that they think they're smart enough, as are the egocentric pet bags that make up the voice of the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like mine, but it does not matter; I do not think it covers any kind of humor. This film is as flat and dull as the spirit of Wes Anderson. Come in and get ready to go out; it is better to get your money back too.
