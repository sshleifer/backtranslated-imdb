I would give this film one out of ten, but I'll give it a two. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this film and makes a kiss with Kamal. I really like Rani and I respect her being a great actress. That's why I did not like it in this film while kissing Kamal, but it does not matter. In any case, enough bedroom scenes that made this movie visible, lets talk about this movie. Is it good or bad, I think it's a complete film that made me yawn. I am a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250 reviews by clicking on my name, I have a lot of taste. The film is not entertaining, it's a thing and if it is supposed that it will be a blow for the cinema, why is there no morale in this film? It's a skewed film that is not a true story and it stinks. See Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, the man can not kiss correctly anyway.
