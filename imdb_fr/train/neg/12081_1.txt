note to George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "I do not think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why did you look like her"? "Simply for the complete absurdity, that, and" it's wrong! "In summary, I would say that we have to thank the MST3K team for trying to ridicule this TV movie, you really can not make fun of it. Bill S was a good playwright, but this production is so bad that even he would disown it, a high school theater club could do better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend buying a book and to read "Hamlet".
