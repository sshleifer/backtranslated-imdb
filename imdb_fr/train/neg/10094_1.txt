Mt Little Sister and I are lovers of self-proclaimed horror movies. We've seen pretty much everything, especially zombie movies. We saw a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Not only was the acting awful, but the special effects, graphics and "zombie" makeup were the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadow around the eyes), it's irrefutable proof that you should never judge a book on its cover. Because the cover of the movie is the only sweet thing about. do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this film that I went so far as to put a post-it inside the film before returning it to the film saying "This film is bad, do not waste your time, come back NOW "Someone else would like to lose a good movie night on this POS movie! I do not even know how he got the odds he made, t should be negative
