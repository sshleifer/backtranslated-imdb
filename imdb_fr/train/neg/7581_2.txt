I saw this movie the other day in a movie school class and I had never seen a film about Almodovar before, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a useless movie, with only a few bursts of laughter and two hours of boredom. High heels is just a set of random scenes that may have worked in their own movies but that together do not add up to form a meaningful whole. <br /> <br /> Or at least, I thought so. Then, the next day, my movie teacher spent the whole class explaining all the hidden little details of the film, such as how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is a kind commentary on the lack of identity Spain as a nation developed under the fascist regime. Apparently, the whole movie is full of little visual tricks and clever references like this one. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's always a bad movie. To make a good film, it takes more than depth and complexity: you must always give the audience a reason to continue to pay attention, something interesting enough for the viewer to really be interested in all the subtle stuff. High Heels gives us strange and offbeat characters, but keeps them in almost worldly situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to argue his point of view. What is the meaning, for example, of the revelation of Hitchcock's surprise character that occurs near the end of the film? Why is it even here? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene related to a news program. And that's it, it's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the film is just absurd film references and visual cues that apparently only exist to show how clever Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film teacher says, it takes more than self-indulgent tricks for a movie to be good.
