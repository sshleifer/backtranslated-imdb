Curiously, it is the eyes and the mouth of Rene Russo - not those of Buddy the Gorilla - which emerge as the central point of "Buddy", a production of Jim Henson Pictures done by Zoetrope of Francis Ford Coppola. In a way, countless closeups of Russo's face have moved into the post-production stages and literally fill the screen so often that the poor monkeys are outclassed. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from the memoirs of Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint on the wife of a wealthy doctor who turns their home into a menagerie for pets and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it drips with sincere sincerity. The film never twinkles with the kind of "family film" it needed, and before long, people and animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here seems real). About ten minutes later, two chimpanzees have fun in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (Alan Cumming's head is missing slowly); yet, no eyebrows get up because everything is in the pleasure of a day. Yet when an adult gorilla, Buddy, goes crazy during a storm, the cops are called - and everyone looks at Buddy out the window as he sets up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this staggering and crazy failure. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: every time the director Caroline Thompson needs a good head shot, she gives Rene without distinguishing another very close shot. I wonder what was the budget of lipstick on this photo? ** from ****
