If it were not for the representations of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as brave, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. takes place in a supposedly abandoned high school (which looks more like an accessory to a 1950s low-budget horror movie), and the disturbed student in the class made a very traumatic joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love too much with his characters, as only one student is killed, as well as the diner (Anne Ramsey of Goonies). We are led to believe that the excited couple is killed, but never see a damn thing! It's a horrible film that perpetuated the downward spiral of National Lampoon in the '80s and' 90s.
