I rented the video of "The Piano Teacher" not knowing anything about it except what was written on the video box. I did it with some trepidation because the films awarded in Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the last category. About a quarter of the way, I found myself saying aloud: "This movie is boring." About halfway through, I thought, "Where have I seen this before?" At the mark of three quarters, I understood it. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman much earlier (1969), and better, "That Cold Day in the Park." Although the details clearly differ and Altman's work was more plot-based and less character-based, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing new to see in this production. All aspects of this work have been accomplished before: an out-of-control character with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant, 1992); a perverse and condemned "love" resulting in a (near) death scene from the opera ("Mr. Butterfly" by David Cronenberg, 1993); unusually brutal sex scenes ("Blue Velvet" by David Lynch, 1986); etc. That's why I'm shocked that so many people have found the film "shocking", "shocking", and so on. This highly derivative movie seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and has clearly succeeded in. However, I attribute this reaction largely to a lack of movie viewing experience. Watch enough movies and you will end up having seen everything. And while it is true that I saw the "R-rated" version redacted, I doubt that the additional scenes will change my general opinion about "The Piano Teacher". <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is not without. deserved. The camera works very well and the lighting is excellent. The remarkable performances of Isabelle Huppert also make it possible to avoid a waste of time. This is Haneke's first film I've seen, and if I saw more, I would have the same opinion of him on Ferrara: an interesting director, but not as great as others describe him. Rating: 4/10.
