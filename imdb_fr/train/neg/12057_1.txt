Charles Bronson continued his recession in the 1980s with what could be his worst film of the decade, if ever. He plays a detective who tries to find a pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and who is currently selling it to the highest bidder. It is a shameful attempt at action and it is without a doubt the most depressing film ever made. Many people regard the Death Wish suites as Bronson's worst films. The Death Wish suites were not great movies but were in most cases skillful and very watchable. Kinjite, however, is a completely stupid thriller, punctuated with petty racism and pedophilia. It's really a refractory film and it's all aggravated by the fact that it's trying to preach a "law and justice" mentality too exaggerated to say anything. Indeed, the film begins with the interruption of sex in minors, then Bronson violates the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater in which I watched the scene was just amazed by the awkwardness of the scene, but also by the choking of the pimp violating the girl in this film. He has no other interest than to exploit and the film was not written enough to go beyond the level of exploitation and offer something that would work. Bronson seems more in the game but it's clearly too disgusting to save. I want to emphasize that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor of all time but this effort is ultimately the worst. The action sequences are also mediocre. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (Awful)
