"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are characters that are not alike. This is not the problem. They are incompatible and we do not like them at all. "The war of the roses" staged characters unimaginable, but thanks to good introductions, we are at least interested in their destiny, whereas in "Envy", the introduction is thin, the characters are never credible and the plot only makes things worse. . <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is just disgusting in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller has campaigned for this video to be published and I now understand why. The film suggests that he is "best friend" of Jack Black, but in the first five minutes we get pictures that seem to indicate that Stiller hates Black. I thought it would develop a kind of one-sided relationship (at "The Cable Guy") but that's never the case, Stiller insists he's his "best friend" and I felt confused while he seemed to treat Black in the following way: "poop." The plot of the movie is ridiculous, but it does not matter because it's supposed to be an exaggerated tale of morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance but Black is discreet and annoying (and I find him very funny). No, it's not a horrible film, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the worst movies of all time he could certainly be much better. I wish Va-Poo-Rize exists - so that this film disappears forever ....
