Yuck! And again I say ... Yuck! The original version of this film was the well-directed story of a man already dead and driving through Purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and did not struggle to say it. And, there was a naked chick on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something that a producer bought the rights and then abandoned by disinterest. It seems that a group of individuals consciously decided to adapt it to the 90s and to have changed ethnicity and gender just to be cute. The film does not speak of a burnout that is about to commit suicide for a final act of defiance. This is a man trying to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this film to have been shot other than to make me angry ...
