I will start by saying that I could not understand everything. I picked it up on a rainy day at Walmart as the rest of the reviews on this site. I thought there was no way to regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this film again and again until the end of eternity. This is the only appropriate punishment I can think of for publishing something so serious. The shooting reminds me of the films I made for class projects on an old and large VHS camera. The acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some nice cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is not funny, and the comedian is a big loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and gave it to many colleagues to watch. Everyone comes in and laughs and says, "Wow, I never thought I'd ever said I'd close a film by Adam Sandler after 15 minutes ...." <br /> <br />
