I have never heard of this film before it was broadcast in a retrospective of Robert Mitchum at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years of the list of actors seemed good to say the least, with seven names - in addition to Mitchum, which tops the list - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, shortly after The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, well before Dallas and probably best known as the daughter of Norman theater designer Walter Brennan, who did not need to be introduced, Frank Faylen, the sadistic nurse of The Lost Weekend and Robert Preston, even more decent than Harold Hill in The Music Man, is Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter. Alas, most of them were wasting their time. I searched in vain for "iconic" scenes as it was Robert Wise on Bullhorn. At that time, he had made half a dozen films and still had to find a style. The story goes that our old friend, the Range War, must have thought it was barely higher than the Hopalong Cassidy oat on which he had his teeth cut. There are no new twists - if you do not count the incredible scene where Mitchum accuses Preston of having slept with Thaxter to get information on his father's plans to move his cattle. That's perfectly true, but how did Mitchum know? We did not see or hear how he discovered it. Overall, not much to say for that.
