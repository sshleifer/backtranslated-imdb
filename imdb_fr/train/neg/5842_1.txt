What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with the title sequence, but it's about as good as that. <br /> <br /> The film is about rats that turn into monsters and go on a killing. The acting is not so poor, but the scenario is useless and the film is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It is really amazing that a group has concocted this bag of garbage and thoughts that would make a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. It's a garbage can, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! One out of ten.
