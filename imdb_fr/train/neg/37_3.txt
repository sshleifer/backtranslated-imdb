Devil Hunter gained notoriety for being on DPP's "Video Nasty" list, but that was not necessarily the case. Many of the films on the list mention only for reasons known to God (and DPP), and although it is not the lowest of the group; there are not many things here that justify banning ... which is a shame, because I would never have done it if it was not because it is on the "shopping list". The plot gives the film a decent base - or at least a more decent base than most cannibalistic movies - and follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way, he must brave the natives, led by a man who calls himself "The devil" (hence the title). The film is only 85 minutes long and there are not many interesting scenes. It's a pity that Jess Franco ended up making films like this, because the man clearly has talent. seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr. Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately, his good movies are just jewels among piles of shit and Devil Hunter is an integral part of shit. I saw this movie only because I want to be able to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (there are only two left!) And I guess that's why most of the other people who saw him see it. But if you are not looking for Nasties; there is really no reason to bother with this one.
