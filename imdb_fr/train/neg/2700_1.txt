Despite, or perhaps partly because of the judicious use of music to highlight the motivations and ideologies of each of the main characters, stereotypes are present, and the likelihood and characterization disappear in this rather subtle film screed . <br /> <br /> One gets the impression that John Singleton was interested in the post-structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and that "Higher Learning" was the tendentious result. The weak point of the film is the "peace" rally, in which the symbols of the "free love" movement of the 1960s are re-appropriated for what looks much more like a "Take Back The Night" rally with acts living musicians, extremely conscious of their identity. in tow. Perhaps in his primitive revisionism, the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how did Adrienne Rich from him ?? and Remy jumping into the crowd is a good idea, if you like the kind of political postures of Rich. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend it to people interested in the history of the 1990s, a time when radical feminists introduced the academic trinity of race, class, and sex into popular culture and declared that hating men was "a viable and honorable POLITICAL option". Where is Camille Paglia when you need her?
