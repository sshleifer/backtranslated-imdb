As one of the few commentators not to have seen the first film, I found this film very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Yes, he has a weird funny humor if you can stand the (highly) morally dubious principle. However, it fails abominably in important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and absurd plot involving the generous friend of Gordon Sinclair who may or may not be involved in a plot to provide dangerous electronic goods to third world countries - possibly in free computers ... or maybe not. Wave, long and inconclusive. The absence of a substantial end is so exasperating and what is present is pompous and totally illogical. The film seems half finished. <br /> <br /> It is extremely difficult to suspend disbelief when one can see a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) being attracted by Gordon Sinclair's unimpressed character, especially when he is pushing his advances. Ridiculous. The situation worsens later in the film when he realizes his romantic ambitions, then throws all this away for ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Few movies let me feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
