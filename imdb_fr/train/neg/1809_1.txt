There is nothing I hate more than self-will. Kevin Smith deserves to be suspended by his toenails for inspiring all the white middle-class vexers to make a film about why they can not get laid. I do not really care about inexperience and low-budget productions, but when the writing is so obvious and disgusting, it really burns me the potatoes. The money invested in this could have gone to a real struggling filmmaker who has a chance like John Gulager. If you look at Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting the system. Anyone could catch a camera and make a talkative image that can not really say anything. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can not come soon enough. See a real first effort buying Desperado or looking for Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day.
