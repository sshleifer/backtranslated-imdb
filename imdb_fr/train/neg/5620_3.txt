There is really no reason to examine this issue further because of some very flagrant and biased misrepresentations. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is where the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the author of the Book of Hebrews He claims to have no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this assertion is either deliberately false, because it accuses others of presenting, or it ignores what "The Bible" says. <br /> <br /> First, we can examine its misleading statement regarding Hebrews 8.4, where it shows a quote "If Jesus were on the earth, he would not be a priest", that is why, right here, he incites the ignorant and uneducated spectator to accept his false premise .. why? He does what he calls the most of the so-called biblical believers he accuses of doing it, it's the same, it's DECLINE things out of context. <br /> <br /> to one of the Hebrew verses 8; 1 .. "Among the things we have said, here is the sum: we have such a high priest, who is placed to the right of the throne of majesty in the "The above context is clearly speaking of Jesus who was on earth and ascended to heaven after his so-called resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his scriptures out of context. Here, he proposes a foundation, namely that "Paul did not know a human Jesus, but only one in" the sky "<br /> <br /> follow? <br /> <br /> to see if the Filmmaker is honest, Hebrews 7:14 "For it is evident that our Lord has come out of Judah; whose tribe Moses said nothing about the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> hey, the filmmaker does not come to quote the author of Hebrews who tries to show the author of this book that he has no knowledge of a" human Jesus "It is likely that Paul did not write Hebrews anyway, but I will not go into detail here, but the filmmaker says Paul did, and that's the premise of the point here. <br /> <br /> It's not like this filmmaker does not argue decent arguments in some areas, but he adopts the same blind bias of the religion he denigrates. engaged in this tactic, in my opinion, he loses all credibility as a religion.he chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion and a bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
