Ok, I watched this movie twice now, I searched the net a lot, I asked several people to give their opinion. I even went to the end of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic "Carmilla", a book on which this film is supposed to be based. I think the best way to see this movie is to describe a game to play by watching it. Since the plot of the film is meaningless, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a Syberia castle with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine. They continue their lives with happiness and serenity. One day, they receive a letter from the "general", a man who has given himself the mission to avenge the death of his daughters. He claims that supernatural powers are at work and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines watching over her daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon, Laura begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to fall with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she really have to do with Laura's condition and the general? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and I want it to be played by as many people as possible and I know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and I would also have a jingle, but that does not bother me. This is called the game "this movie does not make sense". <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, try to create a complete storyline that explains what's going on. I mean complete, all the questions have been answered, everything is logical, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> He will have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around day by day? light? <br /> <br /> * Why are all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? and why does she shoot herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the film a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why does the death of zombies seem to be an accepted part of life? <br /> <br /> * Why is Travis Fontaine spotting and crushing? a zombie without slowing down while driving his car, while he is facing a woman with a visible hostage in the back of his car, accept the excuse that she is also a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why then does he leave a girl, whom he then openly reveals that he knows to be the vampire chief, to lead her with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And then let her go alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What is the scene of the asylum? <br /> <br /> * What is the green boot? <br /> <br /> * Why does the main vampire begin to dress like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why are there never vampires fighting Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? what is it? why is he killing vampires? and how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's just as fun to try to ask as many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my plot, and I have to admit that it's not quite there, but it's a very good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br /> "Vampires vs. Zombies" does not matter where it is are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what's going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience get in on it. And in a way, it's based on a classic horror novel of the 19th century. How? Why? What the hell is happening?
