My friends and I rented this out at Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor's name on the box. This film is a parody, I hope it denies his CV. <br /> <br /> The plot was lost and flaccid, the acting was rather dry and unbearable in some places. The film did not make sense. The intrigue of an extraterrestrial parasite species infecting humans has often been achieved by films whose scenario is much better than this, for example, the invasion of body thieves and faculty. <br /> <br /> If you have ever had the misfortune to come across this film, I suggest you engrave it. <br /> <br /> How it is classified as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror or any of the usual horror movies Techniques that I do not know, but if you still want to watch this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find some fun.
