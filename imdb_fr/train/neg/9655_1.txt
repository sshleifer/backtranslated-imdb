I ended up watching this movie before even reading the reviews, at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know if there are people who recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite shocked to see such long and positive reviews on this website that allow me to conclude that this is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers late or do they assume that viewers are late?" The film is atrocious on so many levels and I do not do not even talk about the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> These guys and a girl (the main actress) are a band; Guessing the constant presence of guitars, it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Damn, when did the dancers start to be part of a rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as being the Bollywood version of a rock band, but curiously all the scores where these two guitarists played all kinds of "ROCK GESTURES" and I guess they play the instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely absent !!! I just can not understand the extent of stupidity here .... <br /> <br /> I'll just wrap up here because it's absolutely not worth pointing out other flaws in the movie. The administrators of Bollywood no longer seem to be ashamed !!!!!!!!
