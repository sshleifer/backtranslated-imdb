Unlike my fellow critics, I always try to find something that redeems in the movies I see. with a flow of blood. Something must be lost in the translation of the word "Bloodsucker" from Italian into the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then change their mind but could not afford to abandon their dramatic opening sequence, so this is added to the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie made in 1975 was recently released on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer that in some ways is more daring than what we see in the movie! Anyone who buys this movie has probably already read his synopsis anyway and knows what to expect. In the mid-1970s I bought it because I'm attracted to Christa Nelli (most often credited under the pseudonym "Krista Nell"). I was hoping that Krista Nell was playing "Cora" but under this huge hair style, it was very difficult to connect them to the concerned actor. costume and makeup, it is difficult to distinguish it for sure. <br /> <br /> There is mainly a two-dimensional representation by the actors of their plays and no one really stands out. Maybe something is lost in the dubbing process. What were the positives? Although the music was atmospheric and of course, if you like the beautiful lesbian soft porn, it's there. The outdoor locations used were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on his island. It is supposed to unfold in "Ireland" (North or Republic?) In 1902, then everyone wears costumes of Some scenes that I found unintentionally funny, especially these scenes of sex! Anyway, fun crazy. I noticed 4/10.
