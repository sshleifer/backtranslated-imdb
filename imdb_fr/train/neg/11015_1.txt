I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago. I started paying $ 15.99 plus tax for that. I took him to a friend's house and we were both dismayed by the poor quality of writing and acting. Wooden shows abound. All the promised "hilarious" and "exceptional" shows never seemed to happen. After 90 minutes, I'm ashamed of myself, knowing that I could never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I almost literally cried too, because if that was what we could consider a "comedy", I did not want to believe in cinema anymore. My friend and I constantly informed one of our friends about the horror of this film to the point that he needed to see it to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year, I looked at him because he did not want to look at him alone. It was my next horrible mistake, because looking at me, I just got angry. I started shouting at the movie, and I'm not one to talk about the movie period. Everyone I know who even saw this film agreed that it was the worst they had ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and crooked and often offends my friends, but it could not even save this movie. The fact that this film does not appear in the list of the last 100 discs on IMDb is staggering. The fact that his note (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
