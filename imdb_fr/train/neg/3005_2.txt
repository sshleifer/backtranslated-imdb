Slaughter High is intrinsically your iconic 80s slasher movie. A farce goes out of the ordinary leaving a horribly burned geek. A few years later, the geek comes back and starts killing the people who hurt him. The story may seem intriguing and very amusing, but this horrible film is so different from the rest of the 80s slasher films, it is that it presents defects without humor and errors of continuation. <br /> <br /> However, in reality, not as bad as you might think. It does not help that all the characters of the film are so bad and inimitable. The manager, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is easily the biggest hangman and she is the one for whom we are supposed to share the compassion and the roots. Not to mention that the geek is almost too geeky and I think that even the stereotypical geeks themselves would be grossly crazy and just upset about how geeky he is, so when he's mutilated, does anyone get it? plug? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of potential for involuntary laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite obvious, which puts her at the same level as the rest of the cast. However, the most fun is easily when the film tries to mislead Munro, who was in his thirties at the time, as a teenager among a cast of teenagers. And then, when it comes to life later and Munro is playing at about his actual age, the rest of the cast does not go into adulthood. All that goes well with a theme song that is a hilarious pose of heavy metal thrash, accompanied by maniacal laughter and a screaming voice, "I'll get you". That said, Slaughter High is really not a very good slasher movie, but it has a disgusting entertainment value. Perhaps an essential element for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect a dilemma, suspense or credibility. Horrible!!!
