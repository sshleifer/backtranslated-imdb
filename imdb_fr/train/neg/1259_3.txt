Thank you Hollywood. Yet another classic movie completely ruined by a cheap remake, superficial, heavy effect and redundant. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and stimulating film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which seemed very boring but actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to have eliminated ALL the dialogues. Instead of a good movie, we get an incredibly stupid movie about two hours of hunting. Dialogue has been reduced to a minimum, interaction and character development are non-existent and most of the time, it is extremely difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we have a bunch of useless action scenes, slightly funny one-liners, and very empty, almost-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it's absolutely fantastic. The composition of the monkeys is beautiful, and the sets and backgrounds are also beautiful. However, this does not detract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very superficial and simplistic film, filled with thin characters, stupid dialogues and an almost non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining the big movies by turning them into senseless blockbuster movies. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the end did not make any sense whatsoever. <br /> * on **** stars, mainly for the visuals <br /> <br />
