A sentimental school drama set in Denmark in 1969, "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic interpretation of American culture by the Danes. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a naïve 13-year-old obsessed with the power of flowers, comes out with half of his ear hanging in front of the desk of brutal master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a school principal, described as a fascistoid tyrant, has control of the local community. Lindum-Svendsen went too far this time, and with his father, he is recovering from a mental crisis (of course, there were not enough dramas already ..), and the hippie music teacher too stereotyped, Mr. Svale ("Hi, call me Freddie"), Frits is fighting for justice. <br /> <br /> What are you saying? It is so unconvincing, too (methodical) to act and so full of misery, that as a family photo, this grotesque excuse filled with clichés failed to convince a non-Scandinavian audience. Sorry, dear Danish readers, to get you started like that in your romantic travels .. But it's certainly not a story about a "boy who becomes a man fighting the system". The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive crier face with wide-eyed eyes. If you call a church made up of small town people, led by a dictator like the cartoon character "the system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you like family photos, go to Happy Feet instead ..
