It's the worst shit I've ever had to look at - in fact, it was so bad that I really had to watch it :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is so bad it's fun ! It's not even close to crappy CGI animations in Spawn, it's so bad, har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm amazed by the fact that a distribution company has actually put the money to release this on DVD, but I guess they will get more money this way, because the cost of its manufacture can not be greater than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that a kindergarten class could have done it. <br /> <br /> See and laugh!
