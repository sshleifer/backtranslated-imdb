Woody Allen has done some of the best comedies of all time and I would seriously think that Annie Hall is the best movie of all time, but if I really think about it, I will probably think of one or two best ones, but would be difficult. Of course he had films that were not very good but not so bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had a movie as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so funny, his films are usually witty and hilarious, but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot revolves around four friends who are dining together. Two are writers and one of the others evokes a funny story that happened to one of his friends. This is a young woman who burst into an unexpected dinner. We never hear the rest, because the two written pieces begin to wonder if it would make a better comedy or a tragedy. Then we begin to see both points of view. Both focus on this woman named Melinda who has drug problems and with her ex-husband. In tragedy, she is a former family friend who, after attempting suicide, decided to stand in front of her former best friend's door for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida stumbling over dinner after taking 28 sleeping pills. Both go in a swirling wind of events that never really make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some great performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can not be combined together. They can not stop it from going deeper than most other films this year.
