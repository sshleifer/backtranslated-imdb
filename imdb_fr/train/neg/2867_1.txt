I was lying on my bed with a very bad cold, flu or something else. I guess I might lose some time watching horror movies that my mother bought me some time ago. I hope I have never chosen this movie! After looking at it, I felt even sicker and wanted to throw up. After words (when I improved, of course), I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and noticed that the Dennis in the movie did not look anything like the real thing. I hope no one will ever watch this movie, but if they do not eat or feel what I felt after watching it for the first time. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least, this movie had better reviews on this site.
