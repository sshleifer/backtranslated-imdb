I do not know who Sue Kramer is, the director of this film, but I strongly suspect A) of being a lesbian and B) she shamed all the people involved in this project to participate to prove that they are not not homophobic. I can imagine everyone thinking, "My God, it's horrible, not funny, pedestrian, totally lame." But by keeping their mouth shut, they fear being labeled anti-gay or "not understanding" the gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer did NOT throw gays to play with gays.) Anyway, it's not even worth telling. The actors are all encouraged to play each scene completely above the stage to avoid any sincerity or credibility. It's full of clich√©s and there is nothing in this film that is the least fun, but much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated him and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad the people without resources who gave Kramer the money needed to make this bomb were not so impartial in their judgment.
