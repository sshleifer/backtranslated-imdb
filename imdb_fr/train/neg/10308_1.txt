It's really bad. Lamas shows how a second-rate actor does his job. But what is worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabbed another policeman by the throat, as if to kill him while the jukebox plays a song with the words "I have evidence ". (That makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but I could not find on iTunes). Talk about seeing in the future ... Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. Ditto following. Which raises the question of why they would do a sequel at all. I thought I understood that overseas sales were the driving force behind many of these B movies. They do not say much about the world's listening habits.
