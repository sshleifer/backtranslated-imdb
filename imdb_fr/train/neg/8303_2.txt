Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story", the story told by Jean Shepherd of his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a real classic. "My summer story" still has Shepherd as narrator, but it has absolutely no charm and the characters are far from the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> "My summer story" is basically a hodgepodge of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, which include hillbilly neighbors and warring tops. Charles Grodin, whom I like, is extremely unpleasant in the role of the father (more aptly treated by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is almost forgotten here. Only mom seems to have some value here, and maybe it's because she's holding a movie director with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with angry housewives the "free dish". <br /> <br /> are mostly inconsequential and very fine. Can appeal to the extremely simple but as a result of "A Christmas Story", it is a very poor one that is not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10
