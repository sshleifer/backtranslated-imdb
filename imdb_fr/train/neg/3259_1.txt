Fantastically putrid. I do not want to say above that only a few people should avoid "Doc Savage". Almost all demographic groups would be bored with this insignificant production, the quality of a televised film. It's a bit like the 1960's "Batman" TV series, except it's not funny. Even accidentally. You better take a nap.
