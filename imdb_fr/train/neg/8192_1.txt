Well, I must say that this movie was so bad that I would be out if I did not have to see it again for work. And worst of all, I was so eager to see him that I drove all over the city paying $ 10 parking twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always has - the only time I saw him play, someone else was in this movie with John Travolta. Anyway, the plot has potential - it sounds good in the preview, but it's filled with completely ridiculous, predictable and weak plot turning points. And I was hoping it would be a Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN "would not need to be saved, and that Santa would not need to be replaced, but no.The only interesting part was the walks In sledding, and the little kid I'm sure this movie would be good for young kids, but for adults it's so lame that it's a chore to sit down.
