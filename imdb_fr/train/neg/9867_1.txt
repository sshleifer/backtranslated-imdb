I saw a video of this before last year's awards season, I did not really know why they had distributed them after the end of the vote, but no matter, maybe for advertising, at least but the movie was a complicated mess. Of course, some parts were funny black humor, but none of the characters seemed really real to me. I could not communicate with one person and I think that's where it failed for me. Of course, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive for Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... Let's see if this has not been exploited to the point of uselessness. This whole thing seems wrong, from the light to the casting, through the script and the horrible visual effects (which is supposed to be intentional, I can say, and everyone can, no one laughs with you). Anyway, I hope it will at least be available for sale on DVD, I would not want a project in which many people are obviously making a lot of effort to become completely unnoticed. But it's guts anyway. Boring tripe to that.
