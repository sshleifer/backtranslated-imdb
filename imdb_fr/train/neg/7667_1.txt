The definition of an abomination as defined by the Webster dictionary is "a cause of horror or disgust". If anyone can think of a word or definition more appropriate than this one for "Alone in the Dark", let me know, because it's the best I can find. However, I do not think that word anyway describes how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes, the other is a guru of action and adventure movies. The latter type does not usually care about the size of the holes in the plot, as long as the film contains a lot of explosions, he will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> That being said, we entered the movie theater for Friday. alone in the dark. To my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When that started, I knew immediately why. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of a movie and, sadly, I have to admit that it's getting worse. The opening scene is a 5 minute scrolling text that is commented. Yet, I understand why this has been narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people could even get an idea of ​​paying to see this film. Yet not only is this first scene the longest running text in the history of cinema, but it also has no meaning. It seems that in the same sequence we hear about completely separating the films. One concerns an ancient civilization and its inviolable portal, the other a mad scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then begins the appalling scenario, the acting, the effects and the work of the camera. Tara Reid is a terrible actress. She does not do anything, even for a second, to make you think she's a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing that man has ever created. Throughout my life, the roommate with similar tastes asks questions such as: What is it? And what's going on? Other than this junk scroll, we have some sequences narrated by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain something? NO. As an audience, do we have any idea why we should be concerned about what's going on? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they behave as if they care for one another. But then BAM ... sex scene. Once again, I do not know. <br /> <br /> A good, oh I do not know, 30 seconds after the end of this lamentable scene, we have a shootout with twenty soldiers and a similar number of alien things. This is set on a heavy metal track and causes more brain haemorrhages than ever thought. <br /> <br /> And if that were not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no main villainous source. There is the scientist and there are the "extraterrestrials". At one point, the scientist controls the extraterrestrials and stands on a hill, ordering them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reid strolling through an evacuated town. Why was the city evacuated? Did the extraterrestrials break through? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... and who cares? I did not do it and you will not do it. <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an extraterrestrial thing. Even though it has been stated that extraterrestrial objects would be killed by exposure to the sun. And that's right, you guessed it, it's the middle of the day * &% $ ing and it's as bright as possible. Maybe the extraterrestrial thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. Now, after the movie ends, I rushed outside the theater 6 feet 6 inches from me, waving my hand. my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my action / adventure roommate Gung-ho (who would consider a movie that just cut and paste 2 hours of explosion into a movie is the best thing ever created) admitted that the intrigue holes were very obvious in this movie. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST, I give it a 0.0 / 10 and decrease it if I could. <br /> <br /> Unmistakable, the worst movie of all time. I would not want this movie about my worst enemy.
