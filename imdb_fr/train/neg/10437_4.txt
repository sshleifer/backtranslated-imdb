Funny comical drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. The quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman, with eccentric characters, is so overloaded with weirdness that it begins to crack from the beginning. Part of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is just starting out as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every moment like a glamourpuss like Bud Cort's vision of a "bird mother" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler!) In mind, Bud Cort is - once again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; not as confusing as, for example, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and harmless, a difficult move to succeed. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's failures. He can assemble a casting and a centerpiece like no one else, but let him be ignited by misguided inspiration and spiraling. ** from ****
