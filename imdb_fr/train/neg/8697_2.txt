Carnosaurus 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn and Billy Burnette. Why even take the time to see this movie again? Another stupid movie about dinosaurs in which very secretive military discover these deadly (and very fake) prehistoric monsters that kill people in a bloody way. The original was already bad enough, the result was even worse. This is somewhere in between, although it has nothing to do with any of the previous CARNOSAUR movies. RATING: 2 out of 10. R rated for graphic and gore violence, macabre images and blasphemy.
