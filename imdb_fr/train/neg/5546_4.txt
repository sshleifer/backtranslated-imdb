This film looks like a sequel to "White Zombie", since it is made by the same man (Halperin) and includes zombies. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his time, does not succeed with this one. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of Cambodians and seek to destroy the source of his power so that zombies can be sent for free. In addition, a love interest for the diabolical man. <br /> <br /> This movie really excels in the pictures. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombies are very powerful. Unfortunately, we do not really see a lot of zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too important role for a horror movie (although this has a valid reason for the plot later). <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see 1930s zombies attack defenseless townspeople, but this film did not succeed. And no bad villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but misleading because it is never in the film ... why not recreate it with the eyes of the new actor? Overall, a film that could be great with a little scenario that works again and could one day be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war setting). Heck, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie has hope.
