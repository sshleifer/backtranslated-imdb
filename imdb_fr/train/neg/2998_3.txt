For the fans of Judy Garland. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she makes a number with an older housekeeper (you've all seen the pictures) and a very good number at the end. There are some scenes where the lines are funny. But, basically, the scenario is so bad and the film so old that it is difficult not to retreat before the horrors. But it's worth it to rent the movie for â‚¬ 2.50 - get ready to move it fast.
