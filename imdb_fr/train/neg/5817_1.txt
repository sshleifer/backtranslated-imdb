The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotyped "White-Trash", the "plot" of the movie was stunted from the beginning, and the worst aspect of this movie was that nudity was so blatant from the double of the body that it was funny. Unfortunately, it was the only funny thing in the movie. Mrs. Jenkins would be better served if, in the future, she would refrain from using the story of her life to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The positive aspect of this film (it has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film) is that my brother paid the money for this whore.
