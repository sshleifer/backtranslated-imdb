I give an UN to this film, because it's really a horrible movie. The soundtrack of the DVD is so bad that it hurts my ear. But the vision, as disjointed as it is, shows something really fanciful in Italian society. I will not go into the details of what was really shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So, for the kink value, I give him one. Otherwise, the video, the photography, the game of actors / adult actors are simply unsatisfactory, a practical jock for those who love foreign films.Roberto, the main character, has the whole spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of to be incredible. However, the children of the film are mostly three and a half years old, and they are authentic and the film gives a glimpse of Italian life ..
