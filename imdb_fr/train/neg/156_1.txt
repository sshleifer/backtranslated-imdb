Zu Warriors should certainly have been an animated series, because as a movie, it's like watching an old anime under acid. The film simply starts out of nowhere and people argue with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices her lover on a cloud or something. May this princess be a god or an angel is beyond me but soon this nasty wind is flying between and kills it while the guy with the razor's wings is fighting against another mystical thing of God / Demon / Sorcerer The plot does not exist or is extremely difficult to follow. You must be incredibly smart to get this movie. The plot soon follows that Chinese mortal who is called by this god to fight the evil flight, the princess kills the villain and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a complete fighting scene with terrible martial arts on a mountain or some thing.Even the visuals are strange some might say they are beautiful and colorful but I will say they are blurry and travel acid like (yes it's a word!). I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were just as bad and hard to understand .... which I laugh at I did not understand at all. was watching episode 30 of the 1980s anime and was completely missing the beginning of the story or, as if I had started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because I did not know how that thing had started where she was going or how she would end up, I was lost the I can honestly say it was one of the worst cinematic experiences ever, but it was as if I was watching Inu-Yasha on episode 134 drunk ... yeah it's true, you do not know what's going on. brain trying to understand that.
