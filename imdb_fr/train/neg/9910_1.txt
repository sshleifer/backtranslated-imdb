One of the worst movies of all time. Not funny, mediocre tv-style cinematography, bad actor. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, much less to act. Leader Nancy Young can not act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Sometimes, weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic principle of the film makes no sense. In one way or another, they are supposed to prevent a marriage from happening, but their actions are not logical. The slow pace forced my wife to stop looking, but I suffered. Older men are supposed to behave as if they're young and excited, but it's pathetic instead of funny. How did they even get the money to do that?
