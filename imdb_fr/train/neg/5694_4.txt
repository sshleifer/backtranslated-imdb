I'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially Early Edition). As he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also attracted me; a man who wants to play the game (Tony Greco.ka M. Chandler) must kill a person at random before being entrusted with the life - or rather the death - of a witness who will testify against a member of the "family" . The movies were nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many useless parts. Basically, it was dirty and not logical. Yes, it was a crowd movie, and yes the guns go to BOOM. But there is more in a movie than that. This film acted as if it had not had time to go into the details - just manage it and understand it. The acting really compensated - James Belushi was quite amusing like "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel as believable as possible. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was just as convincing as a newcomer concerned with "the family". If only the scenario did the actors justice.
