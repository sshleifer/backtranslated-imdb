It was nice to see all the familiar characters, but the story bothered me. We liked Ariel in the first movie, so why is the second one centered on his daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like the plot of it. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as Eric's voice! Disney, stop redoing classic movies with these poor quality imitations.
