I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to start with, I was always disappointed. The most flagrant mistake in this movie abomination is that the main argument (the guy who was awake during the surgery) had nothing to do with the result. It would have ended the same way anyway. So what was the purpose of that? Who knows. In addition, this surgeon had 4 malpractice lawsuits and he did not think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Leave me alone. Jessica Alba is completely without talent and Christiansen is almost as bad. Everything was just laughable from start to finish. I'm pretty sure that if you feel someone cut your chest with a scalpel, you'll have more pain than that.
