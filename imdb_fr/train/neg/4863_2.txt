Why oh why do not the hit movies stay true to their selling point? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see animals talking jokes, and in doing so, we were all happy ... And then, as for Lost In Space, came the two killer blows - conspiracy and feeling. Who really cared what happened to the tiger or if Eddie Murphy had made up with his daughter? Not me, for sure.
