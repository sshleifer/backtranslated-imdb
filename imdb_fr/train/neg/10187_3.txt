Stupid and stupid drivel around a jet assembled in a few hours by mechanics who have never worked in aircraft (piloted by Burgess Meredith) in search of a Porsche race car running over decades of gas sludge , led by Lee Majors, starring Chris Makepeace -Wiz who can McGyver spare parts in a radio receiver that can pick up all frequencies simultaneously, and who has learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make explosives in a perfectly fit society peaceful. As stupid as it may seem. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven on the grounds that it was only his second film.
