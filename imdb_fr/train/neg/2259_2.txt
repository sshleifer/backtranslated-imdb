For my life, I do not understand why they would like to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's incredibly trashy. In some ways, it is unfortunately a guilty pleasure. We must all admit that we have seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this recently in the United States. Not bad. I will admit it. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as an actor. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. It is played primarily. All she needed was her boyfriend, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show". It's more pleasant than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
