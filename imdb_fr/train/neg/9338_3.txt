Pam Grier plays the role of Coffy. She is a nurse who wants to take revenge on the drug traffickers who have made her sister hooked on the bad heroin. Like any Blaxploitation movie from the 70s, you can expect to see the racist villains get their just dessert. <br /> <br /> Dozens of these films were made in the 70s and they were very devaluing to the black and white audience. This is mainly due to vicious racial hostility in these films and degrading stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> Coffy's other similarities with other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and beautiful women. crazy about sex. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug traffickers, pimps, gangsters and other criminal criminals. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of the Blaxploitation heroines of the 1970s. She was gorgeous, tough and gorgeous at the same time. Like in her other films, Pam surpasses other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen that these kinds of films are unassailable, without her as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you'd better see her seeing other movies, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These movies have a lot less empty movies than Coffy. Pam's character in Coffy is degraded far too much to attract the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation movies do not bend so low for revenge, unlike Coffy. <br /> <br /> I would say that only look at Coffy, if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes Coffy's vision bearable.
