This is a first for me, the first time I'm disappointed by a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and other great performances), but it could have been done by any Hollywood director. The pace was very strange, the last third was spent waiting for the end of the film, by myself and by the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure of the film. Come back Tim.
