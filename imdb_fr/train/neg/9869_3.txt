I did not care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where he was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. now, I look like a model, but I think I will still submit my comments. and yes, British Columbia is adorable *** Or why did they take it in its coastal setting of South Carolina? (this question is asked) The place was essential to the structure of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. Oh, I just read where I have to write at least ten lines. Here is my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too tasteless and not at all that I described from the book. I know, the book was the book and the movie; not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathic. The book also evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the film's "castle" was much more visually impressive, it distorted the meaning of the story and seemed to contradict the characters.
