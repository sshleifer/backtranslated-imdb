Really, really bad. How is a movie so bad? I was still waiting for a redemptive plot, an interesting camera work, or at least a free nudity, but I did not have anything. I had just seen Cabin Fever and thought it was a train wreck (with the exception of nudity and Pancakes) but it sounds like genius compared to this sinking. The best doctor in writing in the world could not have saved this putrid pile of stinking poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing to do for this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I only paid $ 5 and it will all end up in a landfill.
