There is a good movie hiding here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral problems that would arise for a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so confused that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (naturally) paranoid to catch the mysterious airborne contagion that has practically exterminated humanity. Yet, they wear surgical masks sometimes, not others. Sometimes they are fond of wiping with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> Worse, after seemingly surviving for a few weeks or months in this new world where all are killed, they are constantly behaving like total newbs. They do not care about accumulating adequate equipment or food. They are running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not take basic precautions when meeting strangers. And having traveled through the decaying corpses of the entire human race, they are as seductive as protected beginners. You have to constantly ask yourself how they could have survived so long ... and even if they did, why would you want to make a film about them? <br /> <br /> Then, when these dweebs stop suffering from the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their introspection seriously. Their actions should first have a minimal meaning. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have to deal with the dubious abilities of Chris Pine. His portrait of the arrogant James T. Kirk could have seemed clever, taken in isolation. But in Carriers, he plays exactly on the same note: arrogant and stupid. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes its entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film * seems * excellent. It has a too clean and saturated look that really suits the regions of the southwestern United States. But that can not save really weak writing or thin (and boring) characters. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.
