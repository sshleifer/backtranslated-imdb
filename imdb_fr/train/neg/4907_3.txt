SPOILERS THROUGHOUT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "1st to die" and I wanted to see if the movie was following the book, so I was watching it. For the most part, he did it. There were some minor differences (the place of the last violent scene for example), but not much and the film remained largely faithful to the book more than in most movies. <br /> <br /> It can be a mistake Although the film was perfectly interpreted, especially with Pollen and Bellows, the book did not really impress me. Or let me take it back. I left very impressed, I became more and more disillusioned, and at the end I remained completely dissatisfied and felt almost gypsum. No difference with the film. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payment" in the book or in the film. I rarely read a thriller that created such disappointment with its final resolution and I had hoped the movie would change a bit. <br /> <br /> The whole thing - (he did it, NO she did it, NO, they both did) was not interesting, neither fascinating nor more confusing, boring and depressing than anything else. Add to this that the love of Lindsay's life dies in the end (after her illness has dissipated and she cried on her grave) ... and that she has reached the point where she plans to commit suicide ... then, suddenly, she fights for her life with the TRUE villain who was whitened after being arrested .. but it turns out that he and his wife were together ... HELLO !!! All this has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old thriller. I felt cheated and scammed by the book and watching the movie (I have to admit that it caught my attention - the acting was very good for a TV movie) hoped he would not follow the book he ended up make. <Br/> <br /> I still think that the film is viewable and that for some reason it does not leave as bad a taste in the mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what will happen) But I must say how this The story unveiled was not at all well done.
