Of course, "Flatley" is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael really pushes the envelope of irony with this new title: "Feet of Flames" <br /> <br /> > You really can not resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray to Flatley, who is retiring (and clearly, sick). <br /> <br /> I would add that, just like this exciting London crowd (see review below), I'm also excited that this is his last live show. <br /> <br /> "Highlighting that this may be his last concert, Flatley is applauded by an enthusiastic London crowd." ~ Perry Seibert, Guide to all movies
