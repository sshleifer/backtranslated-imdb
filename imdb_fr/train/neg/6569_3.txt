Max had the V-8, Trace (the last and only hero of Wheels of Fires) has a jet engine in the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he propels himself around the desert halfway sorry. Let yourself be amazed as Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and merged into a new film, even if it is dullly filmed with bad actors and lousy stunt work. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF installed in a post-apocalyptic vacant lot? Simple, the Road Warrior was! In fact, all questions can be answered by: it was like that in the Road Warrior! With the exception of the mutant actors out of the work of the movie The Time Machine of the 60s, who make an appearance to give the public a non-vehicular action to chew for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The fashion of the 80s, all cars driven by villains who are hit or slightly jostled explode in a huge explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will take place near convenient cliff walls and cars will inevitably fall. The general misogyny that reigns in this style of low-budget film is associated with this eerie film race of the 80s. In general, I was waiting for the car propelled by a Trace rocket to accelerate and shoot flames to allow it to take another photo of him frowning as if he was supposed to be hard, which is all the more obvious since he looks constipated. A badly choreographed action associated with a bad game makes this movie a real toad. The value of unintentional humor even manages to wear thin. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Mattei's Nights of Terror is superior. And that in itself says a lot! According to this figure, 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A mediocre road warrior who does not have enough cheese factor to make the movie visible. <br /> <br />
