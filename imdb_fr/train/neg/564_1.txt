The producers made a big mistake by appointing Mark Lester, who could neither play nor sing, in the lead role. Aside from his very bad "game", all of Lester's songs had to be dubbed by a girl. I do not know why they make it play at all, because there would have been many boys who could have played the role infinitely better and do their own singing too. Shani Wallis was way too old to play Nancy, who was only 16 years old. The current version of the West End is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly much more handsome than Jack Wild. It was clearly political to give this old-fashioned musical an Academy Award after the tumultuous events of 1968.
