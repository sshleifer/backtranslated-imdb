I am embarrassed to write this review. I say that because those who read it will know that I have witnessed the whole debate and that it is embarrassing to admit it, even to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read the comments of viewers on IMDb before watching a movie not to watch this one. It's the least I can do. It's a bad movie! Believe me. The plot is clumsy. The acting is amateur. And staging, filming, sets, costumes, etc. are all second-rate. Let it go.
