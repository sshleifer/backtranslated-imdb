it is quite usual Indian waste that presents itself as cinema. As Indians, we can proudly boast of having the biggest film industry, but also the worst. <br /> characters who challenge the views of their respective companies and we continue to pump garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, watch their shiny films and we get pissed off like Kisna !! cinema.
