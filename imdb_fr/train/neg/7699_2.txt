I was expecting a comedy like "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the film was a strange mix of comedy, drama and love story. <br /> <br /> This film has three intrigues: The first involves Madea and she is hosting a child in foster care. The second involves a woman betrothed to a rich man who mistreats her. The third is a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There is actually very little comedy in the film. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the fed child with a belt (comically) to convince him to straighten up. In fact, the child turns around. Apparently, beating children is profitable. <br /> <br /> There are plots of land dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men watching young girls related to them. (The makeover takes place during a family reunion.) The movie goes from one plot to the next, so you're still out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
