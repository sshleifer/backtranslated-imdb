The guys who still think about watching this movie already have problems in mind. This film has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (in case of thought), it's another B, I mean a category E movie consisting of a group of horny teen girls in some sex scenes watched just before their spleen is splashed on a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or fun. If you really feel gore without a plot, then look at Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep in the middle of his staging. Look only if you have absolutely nothing to do in life and that the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV.
