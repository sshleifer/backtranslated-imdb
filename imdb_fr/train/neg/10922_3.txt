Worse than the note that was given to him. It's a typical SciFi movie nowadays: bad or bad game, a badly written script and bad direction. From the opening scene where DeMille buries his decor to the end, this film is terrible. In the opening scenes of this film, Moses (who was Charlton Heston in DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) watch a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that had to represent the three icons above were awful and had to look like the people they were supposedly "to be". The fact that it is in the desert, far from civilization, is hilarious when someone is injured and they all scream for an ambulance. The screenwriter is obviously oblivious to the fact that there is no ambulance in the middle of the desert. I was deeply disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such poor quality.
