Oh my God, where to start ... this movie was really awful. The writing was bad, playing was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I wanted a horror movie, but I certainly did not understand! I thought it would be pretty decent since I'm not difficult. I watched several bad horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, whatever their horror. At one point in the film, I made a comment on "corn syrup blood" and in the peculiarities, they actually confess that it was a Karo syrup (brand corn syrup. ..). The film contained everything needed for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer, silly moves) but it was completely missing something to really make it good. The writer should either take classes or simply give up!
