I was expecting a film based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the epic Beowulf, but told from the monster's point of view. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think of Gardner's book, a film based on Beowulf's epic should not be called Grendel, when he does not say more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, the authors should also be punished for screwing up the original and contributing to the growing ignorance of television viewers across the United States. <br /> <br /> Hollywood typical of being wrong so badly. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a total waste of time.
