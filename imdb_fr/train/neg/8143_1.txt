I had the great regret of seeing this film at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been attending this festival for over 5 years and I have certainly seen some bad movies on occasion. However, "First Bite" reached a new record in the film. Despite being shot in beautiful places, with occasionally fabulous exquisite cuisine, the film challenges an excessive number of twists and characters on stilts until I practically beg to see the end. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, David The Hague, has completely failed to show the evolution of his character throughout the film, describing a pompous leader from beginning to end. Additional subplots, such as eating disorders, were developed so badly and so completely that they did not fit into any context that the film had shown up until then. <br /> <br /> A theme of mysticism was used as a bad attempt to conceal a film that gives nothing, goes nowhere and disappoints completely.
