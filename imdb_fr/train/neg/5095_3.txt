I sat through this movie tonight, forcing myself to stay with him even though I never cared about the characters or what had happened to them, because the two protagonists, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were major stars. of the film of their time and me. I wanted to see them in "something different", which was certainly the case. They both did great performances, but with unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the whole film speaks of a small city of Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly unpleasant characters (the doctor is, obviously, the major exception). . What Michèle Morgan has never seen in Philippe falling in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think is that, if Sartre's work resembles this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus's masterly novel, The Plague, which dealt with a plague in West Africa. North. <br /> <br /> A film well played but without interest.
