I did not like the idea of ​​the female turtle at all since 1987. We knew that TMNTs were four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies. Each of the four brothers bears the name of the great artist like Leonardo, Michelangle, Raphel and Donatello, so Venus here has no meaning or any important role and I believe that the old series of TMNT was much better than the new one that contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we love. We knew in 1987 to have new enemies in all parts. It's a good point to have an action, but having a female turtle is a very weak point to have an action, we wish to see more new TMNT series but the same characters we knew in 1987 without this female turtle .
