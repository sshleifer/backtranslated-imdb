Prom Night 2 is an acceptable horror movie, but Prom Night is much better and explains how Queen Mary Lou's prom was killed by her boyfriend in 1957 and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor of this movie is Micheal the film stars other OK actors and actresses, such as Justin Louis (Wendy Lyon), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). crushing the lockers together and how one of the students is on the computer and Mary Lou electrocutes her to death. In general, all this is an OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
