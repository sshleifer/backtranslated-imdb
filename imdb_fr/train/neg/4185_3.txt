I give this film a 3 because it's worse than cult movies that deserve a real 2. It does not make sense to you? Well, you do not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, an incredibly silly plot, where space cowboys (with cowboy hats) are fighting a race to the space of weak vampires. <br /> <br /> Does it get uglier than that? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her beautiful Norwegian beauty. My God, I'd like Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers to stop taking idiotic roles in silly movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside many movies, he has played in 164 movies on this date! It is true that he rarely played a major role, but still!
