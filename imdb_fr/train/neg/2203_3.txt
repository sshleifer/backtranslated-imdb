Note to all crazy scientists around the world: if you want to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you must give him a scary name than "Paul". I do not care if he is a formidable hammerhead shark, with a sharp mouth and an ability to ambush people in the water and on land. Give the child a more dignified name, such as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if he eats me, I'll probably sit there laughing: "Ha! Go get a load of that !!! Paul the monster tears me to tatters !!!!!" The worst thing about this movie is that this shark story is called "Paul" throughout the movie. It makes it look ridiculous what could have been a decent horror movie. Not that there are no other camper and artificial parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists spend all the movie wandering along this island. One of the girls suddenly starts to get sick after walking in the lush forest. "Getting out of the water and killing it, the only thing SciFI did in this film was let the hottie live, but it's a small glimmer of hope in an otherwise disappointing film.
