As a slasher movie lover, I usually sit down and watch every slash film that goes through my retina, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I would say. The other night, while I was surfing on a channel, the Sleepaway Camp II crossed with me. Of course, I wanted to take a look at it because I had heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I have never seen one (for my shame, I know). I will note that, since I have not seen the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because what I think is wrong is totally intentional because of the very conception of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Now, I guess the Sleepaway Camp franchise is, in itself, a joke on itself. Hell, even the name comes as an intentional joke. Sleeping away from the camp? It's good fun. I can understand that the film just wants to set up something purely horror for the camp, but that's about all I can do. The cast of actors in this film gave the impression that the actors of the original movie Friday the 13th would be Macbeth's performers. Campy requires bad acting, but go for it. Pamela Springsteen, as an evil killer struggling with reality, kills my interests better than she kills the entire cast. As far as comedy is concerned, there have been a few times when I have chuckled, but it was very rare. <br /> <br /> Finally, SAC II is rather boring and I really wanted to sleep outside the camp. The dead are so obviously staged and factitious that you can hardly appreciate them. If you are looking for a slasher movie comedy with a good camp, I recommend the Dread Club. If your channel is surfing on this one, check what is enabled in addition.
