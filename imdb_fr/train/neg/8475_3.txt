(NOTE: I thought I was the only one to write what I did below, but I see the others here agree, I guess it was pretty obvious: it was exaggerated, wrote :) <br /> <br /> The owners went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) alone and locked in the house. That means no milk, but the cat, to his relief, finds a bunch of canned tuna. However, to his dismay, he does not find the first match. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and catches it. This is a nasty rodent that teases Sylvester with the opener and then eliminates it at the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the can of tuna, but can not do it. <br /> <br /> It's a frustrating story and the reason they make the sadistic mouse the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's caricatures where poor Tom always has the worst, though often the little mouse triggers the conflict!
