Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies they show around Halloween. Was it classified G? There was not really anything to make this movie scary, or worth watching. In addition, other people say it's a travesty, but I do not think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor". This low-budget shit festival did not have the slightest sense of humor and made no sense. Basically, you have a monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the closet, killing people, I guess, since you've never seen anyone do it, or a bloody hit. The running diary tells you that people have been killed by the monster. So that's enough. <br /> <br /> The army is weakly trying to kill the monster, which is no bigger than a man. They have a very bad goal. So the FLEES soldiers! Wow, did this movie make the US military pathetic or what? The monster, though difficult to kill, does nothing but walk and roar. Oh, and sometimes a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was an extraterrestrial scam that was slightly interesting and yet total. <br /> <br /> What was the problem with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand many dialogues because of the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster take away the main dumb guy for so long? Why did not the monster come into the closet when he had the opportunity? Why do I insist on trying to make sense of the fool?
