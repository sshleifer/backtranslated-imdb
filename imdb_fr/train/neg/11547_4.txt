what kind of sh * t is it? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was both viewable and worthy of the first film, but from the moment the protagonists get super powers in their dreams, it started to become childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I was expecting to see very mature stuff but it was only for the third of the movie. The rest is for little children. Moreover, he is too focused on Christianity. I know that Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? It is a total orientalism and filled with superiority white / western men. Do not look at it, show it to young kids who love Power Rangers.
