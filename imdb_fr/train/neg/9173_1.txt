I have never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It's possible to take a shootem up video game and make it a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie, you do not relate to any of the characters because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is nice or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Apart from this unique character, the outcome of the film does not make sense, because all the characters were lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst shooting scene of all time. I love shootings. I like when the heroes open on the badguys and clean the house. heck, I even like to watch a badguy house. But this shootout was weird, I guess the best way to describe it is "apathetic". I saw people shooting with more feeling and emotion while playing VIDEO. In this film, it seemed that the "actors" were simply walking in the shooting of everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where is the trash can talk? Where are the grunts of rage among the shots? These are supposed to be children who have been caught in a rave that went wrong ... but even real soldiers acting in a professional and ruthless way show their humanity. <br /> <br /> monsters, I recommend Sam Rummy's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all the copies of this film.
