This gives part of the plot, by the way. A Christmas Charlie Brown is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value of Christmas and the pleasure of having a good holiday. This, however, not. He tries to capture the emotion of a Christmas at Charlie Brown. There is even another Christmas coin, but it fails with dull and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the Christmas spirit, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the film. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa Claus, but does not know how to spell Charlie (for whatever reason, it must be in his letter), she decides instead to name him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam In addition, Sally plays an angel in the room with a word of the day: "Hark!" Instead, she says hockey stick (har har). If Sally says hark 12 times (strangely sounding the same way) do not kill you, nothing will. Patty and Marcy peppermint are an important focus, but that does not make it any better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. She looks like a boy (which does not dispel rumors) and gets angry when she has to be the sheep of the room (terrible baas and everything). Apparently, she is the sheep every year and fears to forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried that she speaks twice, one after the other, and gets the same answer. I guess she must have a short-term memory loss, or something like that. Lucy and Linus are welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but hardly equates to airtime. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this one. Overall, it is a parasite of the original, but compromises the message for some laughter.
