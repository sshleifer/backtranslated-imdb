Well, to answer the question of some people, "why no one remembers this movie?" it's because really, few people saw it in 1978 and it has not been seen much on television since. (If it's on the video, it would be a novelty for me!) Even in the era of the sometimes stupid comedies of the 70s, moviegoers had the ability to avoid the movie. Unless they like Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers, "that" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more funny about "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers, at this time of her career, began to laugh by making cruel jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that all the names "a little" famous of the time are part of the casting. (The most surprising is Doris Roberts later in "Everybody Loves Raymond".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a pretty good idea for a scenario, a man who gets pregnant instead of the woman get lost here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal settles with a bitch to finally lose her virginity, but because she was "above" in his place, he gets pregnant! (A commentary on women who take power away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach gets bigger, it goes through all the feminine emotions and feelings associated with it. Unfortunately, he is now an excluded socially misunderstood! He is attacked by a crowd that wants to make it disappear (I guess). <br /> <br /> He is forced to isolate himself to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you want, a manger (God knows where it comes from maybe! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> All the rest of this movie is worthless and is unforgettable, the humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> Two stars for a good idea and some good touching and relevant moments / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it fails! <br /> <br /> I can not believe Roddy McDowell signed one of them! (END)
