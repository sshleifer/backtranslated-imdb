OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a bit about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Apart from that, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, I can comment on the film: I do not know how nice it is for the Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a very good director - despite the post-modern style too pedantic in the Talking Head style, and even curious and interesting - and I'm surprised he had this idea. I'm afraid it's just one of those lost translation cases, but as a European onlooker watching the movie with subtitles overloaded in English, I just thought it was awful. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, give the audience a break and close your fucking narrator - to the point of almost blowing my head over an excess of quick words and absurd actions. <However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great and it is well exploited in these animated scenes. However, the eye-candy ends as soon as the characters are left out to start with an endless speech not funny at all gibberish on stills. This just makes you want to move quickly to the next scene of hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is currently planning a sequel to this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will discuss the strengths of this first and will be an interesting film, or perhaps scenes more and more narrated. But damn it, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will cause you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. It's probably totally useless for the Japanese, maybe it's a really fun movie lost in cultural boundaries and translation. May be.
