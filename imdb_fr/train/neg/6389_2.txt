I waited almost 25 years to see this film, thinking it might be an underrated work because the animation was not of the quality it had been. He played one of the best movie villains of all time, was based on a series of beloved children's books and was a production of Disney Studios. What could possibly be wrong with that? Almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price, in the high score of Rattigan and Henry Mancini, are the two saving grace of the film. The price is terribly pleasant and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that also belongs to the darkness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the film, though full of inappropriate adult situations, still suffers from a totally boring scenario, a generic bland work, terrible songs and a lazy animation that would not have been moved. on no Saturday morning television shows from Disney in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> This has been a complete disappointment to me. It is amazing that this film is almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. By costing a fraction of that, an independent studio has produced in its trailer more creativity than GMD in an infinite runtime. <br /> <br /> The extra star that prevents this from being "horrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
