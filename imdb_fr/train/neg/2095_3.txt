Battlestar Gallactica was really great because his writing was tight, his look superb, his actors excellent and his stories interesting ... AND yes, exciting men and women were running in uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. The actors smoke a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being elsewhere (yes, it's a Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot of teenage anxiety. Many naked gyratory women (but in the background, which I am sure will be cut for the series) and a symbolic view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker took my attention at all. At one-thirty I wondered again when it was over. <br /> <br /> So, what is supposed to bring me back exactly? Science fiction? It's terribly light on that. Players? Aside from Polly Walker's beautiful turn, there is not much more interesting to do here. There are not even "hotties" in the cast, except perhaps Esai, although he is old enough for the youngest, since he is over 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica and, unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short series for a series unless they really refine their SciFi pencils and start working to do more than The OC on another planet.
