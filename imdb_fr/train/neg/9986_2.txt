The next time you go to a party, someone asks, "The other day, I heard the phrase" the author's will ". Does anyone know what that means? Tell them to sit across 'The head above the water'. The only way Diaz could have survived this movie was through this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are comic scenes and you will have some laughter. However, the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her rather than behind? Why then she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me, the best part of this film is that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars at the video store.
