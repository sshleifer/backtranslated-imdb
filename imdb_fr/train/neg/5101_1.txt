The only thing that came to my mind after watching this behavior was that I would never have the time I used to watch, back. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn trying to win what should have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. Wooden role play, mediocre special effects, the only highlight of the comedy was while our extraterrestrial heroine was in a female form, and all is over as soon as she finished her forced nude sex scene within 30 minutes of The opportunity to do what could have been a decent movie disappears as Nicole Eggbert shows the alien in a bar in 30 seconds, while Joe's police, military and public do not do not take it to the woman who drinks coffee. the cup handles and carries four riders at a time. It must obviously be from another planet. Just where I would like to be when this movie was.
