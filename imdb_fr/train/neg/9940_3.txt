In the 60s, with the backdrop of the rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" of the revolutionary villain Rolling Stones ?? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones ?? more Marianne Fid√®le, Godard unveils other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements ?? Black Power through the Black Panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - mingled with reading a cheap political novel divided into chapters: "The Rolling Stones;" Outside the black romance ";" Sight and Sound ";" All About Eve ";" The heart of the West ";" Inside Black Syntax "and" Under the stones of the beach ". <br /> <br />" Sympathy for the devil "is another pretentious and boring mess of uneven director Jean-Luc Godard. and the footage is terrible, but luckily I like the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it's nice to see them at the beginning of their career, otherwise this documentary would be unbearable.The vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the devil"
