Dr. K (David Hickey) has tried to master a formula that would eliminate all diseases and disabilities, but needs live donors to carry out his work. His brother doctor Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted to the faculty of medicine. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is in pre-law and plans to go to law school herself next fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah cancels discussions with her current boyfriend, who also plays with Walt's lady (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for the work of his unfaithful girlfriend). Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears on the verge of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard. Tell him to "recover" Eddie using his secret and illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, dreadful results occur. Eddie's face swells huge warts as he also takes a liking to human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite that he can not satisfy. Soon, he may even pose a threat to his father and his girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be arrested. <br /> <br /> A typical horrible horror movie suffers from a serious lack of budget, acting and talent. The premise, which seems to be an interesting scary party, fails to deliver even as a zombie movie. The gore is limited with some nibbling scenes but the majority of the violence takes place off camera. The use of time to advance the story can really become boring.
