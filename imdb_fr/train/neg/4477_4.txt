What an empty interpretation without gloss of the classic novel. I wish that people stop playing with the classics when they clearly have no idea of ​​the actual intent or purpose of the original. This version is no different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes was much worse than the casting of Juliette Brioche because Kathy was to be the worst casting decision of all time ... anyway, back to this version. It aims to make history relevant in a contemporary context and in a musical style. He succeeds in both cases, but the great art is nil. A rainy day maybe looked in the air ... The direction was average and the mount abyssal. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn as a Hindley and is in fact one of the lost talents of Great Britain. The role of Heath has been played with a lot of charm and conviction and I think the cast is the highlight of this project. Even if a more talented director would have better used the facilities he had. It is clear that he was a director to rent and did not breathe the project with the passion he deserved.
