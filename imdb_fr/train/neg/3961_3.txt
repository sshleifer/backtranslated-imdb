What a movie dog. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but it's in the midst of a jungle of awful scriptwriting, mediocre mise-en-scène, and the wooden game of the biggest cast. Many characters are unfortunately misinformed, especially Colin Friels, always overrated. <br /> <br /> Very few works appear in this pretentious bin. Much of the "character development" is done by a stupid and anxious voice and often completely contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it is difficult to even understand who the voice over is talking about, because they describe characters so different from those we see on the screen! How do we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is supposed to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these voiceovers tells us. For shouting aloud, the nature of his character is half the purpose of the film and the only thing that allows us to know is a crooked voice! The real killer is the characters. All about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh, despite the fact that we constantly remember that they are supposed to be poor poor people. They are all absurdly well spoken for "junkies". None of them seem to have a real understanding of life on skids or smacks, yet this is supposed to be the case for most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than a TV morning. Crud like this one, perfectly well filmed and presented technically, but a drama of anxiety inspired by clichés that plunges so far that it is plausible and that winds for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni dresses for her birthday on every occasion. There is no other healthy reason to endure this junk.
