Well, my God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard about the remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film "The Haunting," I feared it would be ruined by a profusion of film-size visual effects. summer. But deep in me, I had faith. Without a doubt, with such a talented and unbroken cast ... De Bont and his company will not spoil a film, whose original was a fantastic and scary film that included the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears came out ... a promising film went wrong. Yes, the design of Eugenio Zannetti's production is breathtaking; the film is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can NEVER go wrong. But the scenario puts its good actors to the test, asking them to deliver the kind of overheated dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with dignity ... and it is hardly. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel this horrible fear of the fear of the unknown. No, we get visual effects to show us what we're supposed to be afraid of ... and you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are ... the visual effects are ridiculous. And the highlight is a spooky mess ... but things had gone terribly bad before that. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I'm afraid there's no real chills or creaks in this old haunted monstrosity of the house ... only moans. Discover the original instead. <br /> <br />
