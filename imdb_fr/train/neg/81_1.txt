Life did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot was insane. The game was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give the actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. Once in his life, a good movie happens, it's not one of them. Unless someone has nothing else to do, I will avoid him at all costs. It was a loss of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have preferred to rub my face against a brick wall for two hours, then plunge it into peroxide. It would have been more fun.
