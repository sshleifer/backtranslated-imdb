As the cover page says: "The hamlet of our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching the Keneth Branagh version. It was really a disappointing experience. <BR/> <br /> This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the game, including sexuality; a very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the moment (60) it was a very well done version of Hamlet but can not be compared to the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> just a note ... I found the video in my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows one, tell me.
