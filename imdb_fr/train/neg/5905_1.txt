do not see that. it was one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. it's hard to be sometimes Mormon when there are movies like this one. what a sad vision of Mormon life. If you have seen this film, I can tell you that it is not at all like that in a room reserved for singles. If that were the case, I do not think I would have done it. It's a pity that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and I barely made it. I guess you could say he had all the signs of a movie B. Or are there C movies? anyway ... I just thought this movie was bad and full of cheese. I wish some Mormons start making quality movies.
