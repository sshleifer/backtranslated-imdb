If this film wanted to discourage people from using drugs, it will fail. I was ready to start using them. I was waiting for something to happen and nothing really happened. This film is neither a horror nor a drama. It's just the paranoia of meth users. This movie can win a prize for using the word "F" so often and so needlessly. It was not well stated, but I had the impression that they were making methamphetamine to replace the one they owed to someone. Hector got worse and became more paranoid as the movie progressed and the girl became more and more desperate. The end really did not make sense. The film made no sense unless it showed how annoying it is to get stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a methamphetamine head. I relied on the other comments when I decided to watch this film and the ranking of this film should be well below average.
