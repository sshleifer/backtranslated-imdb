If Fassbinder made a worse film, I certainly do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative and claustrophobic should be forced to see this, to learn to appreciate the more sparing style he had chosen in such excellent films as "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant". This film is so full of artistic and almost symbolic images that it looks like a parody of a "film of art". The scene at the slaughterhouse and the one where a friend of the prostitute, Elvira, surfs on a channel for ten minutes, are just two of the most eloquent examples of what makes this film a real test of the endurance of the viewer . But what really makes me angry are the few scenes featuring Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments that show real human emotion and prove that at the heart of this horrible film was an excellent film that was struggling to break free. Such a waste.
