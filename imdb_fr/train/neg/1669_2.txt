Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on Earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve one life, the other is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the savior of a whole race. <br /> <br /> So, how could we call this killing machine? It's almost as if he's some sort of destroyer, or eradicator ... kind of like an exterminator or something. What is the word I am looking for ... something that puts an end to things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the protector (who quickly removes the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothes) first finds the young woman and imbues him with a hero born of the future to be. The demon ... uhhhh ... "the exterminator" kills rednecks and steals their weapons and clothes, then tries to locate the woman by going to her workplace and interrogating the menacing gaze in people's eyes and repeating his name threateningly. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival while the "exterminator" seemingly without death and unstoppable pursues the couple across the countryside. At one point, he can buy boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Maybe he will try, in an exciting final, to crush them under the wheels of a huge tanker truck full of. .. acid. Then the truck will break down. They will be saved ... but no! He will come back, as hard as ever. He will kill the protector and chase the girl into a meat packing plant where, in a terrifying finish, she will be pushed into a large industrial cutting machine and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe that. I extrapolate too much ... after all, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnated Sean Young by kissing him in a bar, and then told him that the child would be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I also loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young takes another big turn as an emotional replicant, and Stephen Baldwin, a career sweat, is also part of Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. I do not know where he is in the plot ... Maybe he's imported from another James Cameron movie?
