An impending divorce story, or a cliche? - through the eyes of a 6 year old child. Dialysis corny, cardboard characters, stock situations, sub-plot zinc-coated red herring and, worse still, absolutely no profit, neither emotionally nor dramatically. <br /> <br /> Do not you teach creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you can not create a satisfying ending - end the story. I have to ask, "What made you think it was a story worth telling in the first place !?" <br /> <br /> Good, but spoiled, debut by young actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, unforgettable. And they wonder why no one is watching independent movies! It's been 90 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
