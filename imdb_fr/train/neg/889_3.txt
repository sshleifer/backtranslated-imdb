I have never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, I love you", I'm crazy to visit this city! I have been to New York many times and I LOVE the city and its neighborhoods. I was expecting a bit to be touched by this movie, to feel like jumping on a plane and flying right away, but now I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are a lot of meetings and dysfunctional relationships or people who know each other and it does not work. This may reflect a feature of the city, where thousands are said to live alone. Can not you find love in New York?
