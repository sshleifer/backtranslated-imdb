In a nutshell: it's a romantic comedy that really wants and wants to be something more. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. He wants to be deep and humane. It contains interesting images of the camera, lighting, music, montages that give it the impression of an important film. The dialogue is intelligent - sometimes. There are moments of "laughing out loud". <br /> <br /> But here's what keeps it from finally being anything but a late-night stereoscopic cable, in flight, that kills time: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - How often can the puppy Joe Sad-Sack staring into space with his jaw open before he starts to get bored? Maybe a little drool would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - She's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is supposed to be that lively, kind and caring girl who keeps getting into bad situations, so she is very confused, and that's why a sad loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays it very boring. Combine this with the puppy dog ​​face (above) and you will have very little chemistry to worry about. <br /> <br /> (I kept imagining someone else in this role - Kate Hudson for example.) <Br /> <br /> 3. The script and plot - what's going on does not sound right; All the problems are solved at the end with a bow so clean and tidy that it seems like a whistle sounded and the writers were content to say, "Oops, it's time to finish, you have to a train to catch! " So they took the book out of Hollywood formulas, ticked all the boxes and went home.
