I had never heard of that, and then discovered that it was the man with the deadly objective, which I had heard about but had not seen. Connery's presence led me to buy it, and it's not good. It's kind of a cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mash, but it's not funny, unless you find the name of General Wombat (?) Fun. He appears as a flat thriller from the 70s to the last ten minutes, when he comes back to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his collaborators that do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long and the first half had been modified to understand the history of the nuclear bomb ransom and the suicide bombings, which I think are supposed to be played for laughs, but again, are not. It's funny. The filming is excellent, but the studio looks like a cheap television. I could not believe the Key Largo manager, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did it. Just a laugh: Connery throws out his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping off a plane. It never says Never look like genius again.
