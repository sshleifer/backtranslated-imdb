The cover (which represents a man holding a scary gun) would give the impression that it is a martial arts film. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the film is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the United States) This movie is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like that kind of thing, then this movie is not that bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of hearts and asses (a scene even presents each actor with an erection in his pants.) Colors like lime, fishing and red. From the point of view of the director of photography, this film is a drag queen! Several scenes depict extremely close characters, sometimes touching each other during the conversation. In addition, the hero's cousin loves women and all the other guys in the movie are trying to kill him. Is there a message here that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I enter the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts are seized during a fight.) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. No fancy stuff here, just your standard moves that you would see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene that could be the first low-speed pursuit track recorded.
