... is the only way to describe this film on topics that should be obvious: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst plays her role in silent movie star Marion Davies as if she thought she was in "Legally Blonde". The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst exaggerates to the point where you want to reach the screen and slap him. Eddie Izzard is very good except that he plays Charlie Chaplin and he is, oh, too heavy for the role? It's hard to believe that Peter Bogdanovich led this uneven and uneven wreck, but again, he did not shoot a movie to watch, what? 30 years? Sometimes there is simply no return.
