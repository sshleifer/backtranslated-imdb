I will be direct and direct. This film is not good at all. The film buff in me hated the acting, the script, the story, the production and almost all the editing. Amanda Peet proved she was able to act because she was a hotspot for "The Whole Nine Yards". She should have avoided this film with a 10-foot pole. However, the infant part of me found this movie very funny. If you can forget how poor the quality of production is, and if you find funny jokes, you should rely on it. And for those of you who can not get off your pedestal, it's your choice. My inner child is not dead and I laughed a lot. Even in this case, only 3 out of 10, because as a film, it really stinks.
