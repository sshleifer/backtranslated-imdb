In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. This suggests that children are brainless. This insults the children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He has managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children's programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only trying to make money, rather than engaging children's imagination and making money! Lately, my kids are watching old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to look back on its past and recycle children's programs of yesteryear.
