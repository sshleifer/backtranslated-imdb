Like all Carnosaur movies, it's a joke. The way dinosaurs move reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can not be more rigid or more false than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot did not make sense. I mean, they're on a bus first, then in a warehouse, and suddenly they're in a boat. And be serious, is it logical that two dinosaurs could stay together on a van or on a boat? I thought the dinosaurs were the biggest animals and they can now settle into a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave a 3 is because it's always fun. I found it better than the first (I have not looked at the second yet). Just do not rent it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing, because I would not have wanted to waste money by renting it.
