Now that Che (2008) has finished his series of relatively short Australian films (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can shamelessly join the two hosts of "At The Movies" taking Steven Soderbergh to the challenge . > <br /> It's generally satisfying to see a director change their style / subject, but Soderbergh's latest, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story. The story (and editing?) Seems suddenly to belong to Soderbergh. main challenge. Strange, after 20 years of work. He was probably never very good at narration, he hid it well inside projects "angry". <br /> <br /> None of this apologizes for this almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not form (even) a whole". <br /> <br /> Epic Biopic in name only, Che (2008) is hardly qualified feature film! There are certainly no legs, aside from its unusual ultimate resolution imposed by the story, the Soderbergh film, 4.5 hours long, is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the most indulgent of At the Movies in Australia duo, noted the repetitive waste of Soderbergh (HD digital storage): "you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you are in the woods ... ". I am also surprised that Soderbergh did not give us an extra 2.5 hours of EC between his two existing games, because he still left big chunks of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh alienates irresponsibly, if not deliberately, insulting his audience by <br /> 1. Never providing the essentials of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. impose unreasonable movie times with simplistic repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. ignore both the true setback and a narrative of events; <br /> <br /> 4. hardly develop an idea or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. remain claustrophobically episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignore the appropriate context of the scenes - all we get is mired in disruptive time shifts; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistically dislocate all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be confused by incongruous exhibitions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. needlessly bleach its main subject in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! <br /> <br /> Our feeling of claustrophobia is certainly due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen who base their scenario solely on Guevara's memoirs. Thus, in the manner of a poor student who has read only one of the texts he has reserved for his work, the product of Soderbergh is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The audience is captive in the same knowledge, landscapes and circumstances the "revolutionaries", but this does not arouse our sympathy. Instead, we realize that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to prevent his audiences from behaving like the Latino peasants at the time". But it is the same Latin illiterate peasants who have sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to assimilate with us and keep us mentally captive? Such a straitjacket must have a purpose. <br /> <br /> Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally stunned by its repetitions of bushings, its misery of perspective and its lack of variety or character. DelToro's Che has no opportunity to grow as a person as he struggles to educate his own undisciplined troops. The only drawback is humor since Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom are violently lacking self-control over local peasants or food. We certainly have no idea what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of their guerrilla insurgency, as it was. <br /> <br /> The atrocious countdown of Part2 remains terribly episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed nor contextualized. Thus, even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. All the selected events are described in a minimal way and focused on Latin American communities, with Part 1 interviews being replaced by staggered meetings between the corrupt Bolivian President (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials promising to intervene. the CIA (!). <br /> <br /> Rest of Part2's "woods" and the blue filter from day to night exasperates the audience until they watch the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro has felt the frustration of many non-American Latinos to never receive a true and immaculate story of Che's exploits in their own country. When foreign governments still do not deliver a free press to their people - for whatever reason - we can then see how a popular independent American producer might try to attract the least well read ("I may not be very confident "able to read or write, but I am NOT illiterate!" - see Inspector General (1949)) in their own local cinemas.The obvious negligence and too crude simplifications of the film make it very clear that only for the understanding of English, less informed, still speaking, if they had done so, they would have read books on the subject and criticized the relevant social problems between them - learn the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> These perspectives are precisely what societies still need - not just illiterate Latinos from Central America and South America. d - yet this is what Che (2008) fails to deliver with joy. Soderbergh pushes his lead because he is weak in narration. I do not understand why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. It was 44 years, the decline on Guevara was cruelly desired: that's why I went to see this film, but the director has stolen from us diabolically. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) observed that, if Part 1 was "uneven", Part 2 "came down quickly", describing Che's latest campaign in Bolivia with unsustainable details ", which" ... feels almost unbearably slow and upset ". <br /> <br /> Che: The Guerrilla aka Part2 is certainly not a travelogue for Bolivia, it presents A portrait of misery and atavism: The whole second half is redeemed only by the aforementioned humor, and the dramatic but tragic capture and performance of the subject of the film. /> The rest of this interminable film of truth only creates confusion and an irritating misery ... shocking, for a film Soderbergh, to avoid at all costs.It is doomed to break the hearts of all those who know even nothing on the subject.
