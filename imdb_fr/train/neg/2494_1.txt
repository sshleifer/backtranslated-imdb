What joke. I watch it on channel 1 and I think that looking at dry painting is a lot more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that made him sink into this nightmare? Terrible acting, very boring conspiracy and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be suspenseful, but it's more of a comedy. If you want to see a dreadful actor's act, a ridiculous scenario writing and a sub-par intrigue, watch this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not only ask for 10% of my agent to my agent, but would send the bastard back into the process. What a turkey. It's not even made to be on MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure you insomnia. I particularly like the part where Van Dien is thrown into the sea and makes it come back in a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was written by non-union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
