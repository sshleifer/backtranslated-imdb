I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This film, its staging, the script and the acting were totally unbearable. I fell in love with the lack of scenario that can not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, the simplicity and the courage to illustrate the temerity of a great story that could be based on facts. <br /> I can see. why this film was not broadcast to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to someone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply, one of the worst adaptations I've seen turning into a less exploratory plot of paradise on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But, how could this fail when shot in a country as beautiful as Peru? <br /> <br /> To potential spectators, do not waste your time and energy on this flop.
