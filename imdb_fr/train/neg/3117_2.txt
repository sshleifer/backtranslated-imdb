My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I like it too, but I have generally found that it should "stick to what it does best" and focus on comic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the movie. The story was predictable. I realize that this was inspired by a true story. But I suppose there could have been suspense or intrigue while keeping the truth in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a parallel story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. More important, however, would have been a deeper exploration of the "boy's" mother. His psychological profile would have been interesting to deepen. It obviously has a long history that has only been discussed in the most superficial way. If my husband was not a fan of Williams, we would have left 20 minutes. Too bad I can not recover my $ 20 or 2 hours.
