This film has the nucleus of a very good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is a matter of heroes and legends. This film tells a good story with three ends (no satisfactory), a couple of useless and useless bar fights and two so-called "romantic" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire. The rescue scenes are superb - even if the generation of computers is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the background is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand playing (watch it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard seamen at the rescue center and she is filmed for about two minutes throughout the film. It could have been an excellent movie - and Costner needs it!
