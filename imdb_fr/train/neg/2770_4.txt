Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley had made for Warner Bros. His style of director had changed or evolved to the point that this film no longer contained his signature, nor his huge production figures with thousands of extras. In the last years of the 1930s, swing-style big bands recorded the biggest popular hits of the year. The Swing Era, also known as the Big Band Era, was dated from 1935 to 1944 or from 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to determine exactly when it started, Benny Goodman's engagements at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles Angeles in The end of the summer of 1935 was certainly one of the first signs that swing was entering the consciousness of American youth. When Goodman introduced his swing repertoire rather than the company-style dance music his band had played, the youth of the audience went crazy.

In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the evolution of musical tastes (the film was in production only about a year and a half). after Goodman's engagement in the Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting musical moments here and there at Hollywood Hotel, but with the exception of "Sing, Sing, Sing" by Benny Goodman and his band, there is not much to recommend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening show "Hooray for Hollywood" and the production number "Let this be a lesson for you" at the restaurant with driving service. The film is very interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his band playing and Dick Powell and Frances Langford singing.
