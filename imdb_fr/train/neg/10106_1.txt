Yes, I'm sure it could really be a nation. . . if four of them were all around the world and the other two have cloned a few billion times. Dude, I'm REALLY glad to have seen this movie on FEAR.net instead of praising it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's films, and I'm pretty sure if he saw that movie, he'd probably throw up laughing too hard. I mean, what was there with the raccoon girls pretending to be zombies and walking like Charlie's Demons? It was also very useful that the composer chose the rotten fashion show music when the zombies were heading towards their murderer, especially the part they were going into the warehouse by posing as a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / whatever the room with the gong in the background, and the living woman was arguing about the closed furniture store. I could not even say what nationality the murderer was, and the fact that his accent indicated that many nations did not help him either. Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw a random fight scene for no good reason into a warehouse where, apparently, they are shipping boxes of air around the world. So for anyone who loves Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like playing C (C for Craptastic) movies, this movie is for you. . . or not.
