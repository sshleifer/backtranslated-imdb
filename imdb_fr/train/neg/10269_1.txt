this film is scandalous. by scandalous, I mean awful. I had more fun watching the paint dry in my local hardware store one day in August while suffering from migraine and heat stroke. the game was gradually deteriorating as the "film" progressed, and the use of euphoric drugs by the directors became evident as the last scenes approached. when misty was shot down, she decided it would be prudent to blink after the fact. it was not smart. honestly, stevie wonder could have understood that with her eyes closed. If you decide to play with an intoxicated nail gun and watch this movie, keep in mind that it will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
