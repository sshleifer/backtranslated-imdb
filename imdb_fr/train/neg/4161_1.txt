A jerky plot, uninteresting characters and a sub-par dialogue (to say the least) invade this television production that could hardly have been interesting, even with a budget of production of a billion dollars. in their motivations, actions or professed occupations. The plot reads as a bad piracy of Dungeons and Dragons (TM), but with plasma guns and force fields. There are serious problems of continuity and the degree of unnecessary interaction between the characters at least this author who grimaces. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you'll have better acting, a better dialogue and a better plot. Yuck.
