Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic lies in his way of communicating with his audience. His juicy jokes, silly songs, and nude dances worked well because he was able to engage people and draw them into his offbeat world. A lack of live audience was a distinct disadvantage for him and he was never completely comfortable in the movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was designed to make the most of his talents, but Askey, the performer, must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-starred Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham in dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers is a "crazy woman". Peter Murray-Hill, who also married Phyllis Calvert as a nominated filmmaker, gives a bland reading of the scene, and Carol Lynne, a leading actress who performs a similarly bland performance. It's actress Kathleen Harrison's turn to effortlessly steal the film as a single woman who loves parrots and is smashed with Dr. Morland Graham's brandy.
