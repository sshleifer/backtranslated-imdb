It happened there. Fast and expensive cars that only the top 1% will drive. Girls posing next to them in gear magazines. Actors of second level and without name. Cheap promotional appearances by niche culture people. <br /> <br /> This is the basket that Hollywood has to offer. Do not mistake yourself; I love the stupid action movie with hot girls as much as the next. But please, the collective Braintrust who sets fire to the spotlights, he stops, he counts until ten, he breathes, he profits from a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah ", then rewinds twenty-five years and recalls what made the films enjoyable? So, are you still doing movies like that? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of pop culture that he has been a victim of over the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think that their nonconformist is now (not even half of them will get this reference). One leader said, "Hey, what demographic group do you want to clear for $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, the 18-35 market." "Ok, give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Excellent idea, sir." The result? A movie I saw a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and most often with Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. Delusional movies like The English Patient do not float my boat, but generic movies that should not have been shot directly on DVD bother me a lot. It will turn the engines of teens, and I imagine that those at the top of their IQ range will see this as what it is: a break.
