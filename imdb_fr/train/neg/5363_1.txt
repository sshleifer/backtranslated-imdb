I did not think this movie was worth anything bad, bad actor except Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, silly husband, and unfair divorce. If you've never seen this movie before, do not worry, it's not worth it. The only good thing is that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a clever defense attorney who has won many lawsuits and even got guilty killers. He thinks he's so smart, but he's just crazy. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Nice girl, huh. Yes, it's a real fishing, no. She is not a day at the beach either.
