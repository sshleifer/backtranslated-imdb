Over the years, I have seen many of these movies directly in Segal video, and each of them contains the same amount of entertainment; Unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Of course, the action sequences were fun, but that was about it. Seagal was really in his force when he made movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least from the point of view of action), but in the last ten years, these types of Segal star movies do not really match his previous qualifications. The more positive side, the film has used the time well, like some of the action sequences and the use of the mind. Just when the movie seemed to be hanging out, a pretty cool action scene was coming out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more Segal movies would do better if he was not the only one that fans recognize in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if his current movies had this well-known support from actors and actresses, maybe the film will get more popular results.
