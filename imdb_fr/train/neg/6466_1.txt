Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in cinema when he directed this film. His performance as "Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's exactly what he wanted. He does not act too much. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre way and makes fun of his embarrassing and gigantic circumference. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst, funniest moment in film history. While we see him falling head first in the toilet, it's hard to believe we're watching the same actor who played in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I guess The real question is why Marlon behaved this way in his last years. Was he fed up with cinema? Did he just like to be completely stupid? I guess we'll never know. But this film is a fascinating study of what is bad acting. <br /> <br /> On this note, look at his acting veteran colleague Donald Sutherland who is trying to give his replies, embarrassed for agreeing to participate. in this parody.
