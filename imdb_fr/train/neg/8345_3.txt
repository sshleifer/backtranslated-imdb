This film could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. The portrait of Frankie Lymon by Larenz Tate was not good, especially in the musical performances. He does not sync well with the lips and his stage manners are Larenz Tate, whereas he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrait of women as a band of gold diggers was written by Hollywood. The powers in place obviously pushed her, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positive points of the film are the portrait of Little Richard by Miguel Nunez and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is a feast for the eyes, as usual, even in a conservative role. Too bad the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The entire Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a missed opportunity.
