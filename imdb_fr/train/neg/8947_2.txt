The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason why this film did not adopt a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, total reminder came out a few years later and it worked well. Even a mechanical orange released in the 70's tried to create a futuristic world. The dark German Expressionist colors, the black-and-white sequences of the vision screens, have no reason to do so when the film was shot in 1984. The main character is a white-collar writer, but he dresses as he works on oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to adopt a fake-communist approach as regards the scenography, the atmosphere and the theme. Yet the novel does not necessarily dictate a communist theme worshiping the humble workers. This book must be seriously adapted in a modern context, because it is more relevant than ever. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this shit. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of clairvoyance is annoying, this film seems to have been designed to deny realism or credibility, whereas this is exactly what is needed to hammer the novel's messages to the viewer.
