This film is considered a classic on not feeling about any quality of film making. He goes from the improbable to the incredible, the unrealistic to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot revolves around an attempt to rescue a third soldier captured by an insurgent by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer. Indians. In the next scene, we see a complete regiment with drum and bagpipe in ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt and, if you succeed, he does not attempt it with a single Indian soldier and servant when there is a complete regiment at his disposal. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly incompetent that it's ridiculous ... they are hundreds but they can not hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing blocks of stone from the ramparts to the insurgents, who are scattered in the mountains in ambush ... it would take an eggplant for the brain to think it would do damage. After Cary Grant has been shot, the rescued prisoner is lying on the ground and watching the boy from the water ... it's not the behavior of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (coming from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... he does it by getting up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we Let's shed a tear as he continues trying to sound more notes as he is hit several times and the bugle call breaks into small shouts ... instead of blowing the bugle hiding at the shelter, as anyone with a half-brain would do. This scene has been legitimately parodied in comic skits. If they wanted to do a comedy on Buster Keaton, they should have hired Keaton and do it better.
