I remember seeing this caricature at the age of 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather took the video for free at the mall. I remember it was really bad. The plot did not make sense. I hated the fox turned Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried out his head if he could not find a friend. So what? To move on! The only good thing and I do not want to look mean is when the fox was shot and died in the end. I laughed at myself because this caricature was so bad. The bad news is that the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he stayed dead. I think I even gave the video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offer it for free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let them watch. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
