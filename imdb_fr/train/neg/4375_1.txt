Less embarrassed and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this film gore Kazuo Komizu worth the detour (at least once). <br /> <br /> Sordid snapshots escort actresses / models to an isolated house in the woods to sexually molest them. Unfortunately (for excited boys), a long-time demon living in the woods has already targeted girls for fun. <br /> <br /> The thing even ends up having fun with the boys - that's IF you consider beheadings, mutilations and masturbation with the limbs cut off as "fun". <br /> <br /> Again, it sounds better on paper than on movies. <br /> <br /> Exactly like Komizu LIVING MORTAL AT TOKYO BAY with his unsuitability, he also fails and is saved only by a bold violence and superb shots of white panties. <br /> <br /> Do not buy the hype, though, or you 'll be cruelly disappointed.
