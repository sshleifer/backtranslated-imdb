Just a movie about a twin woman who has a troubling vision of her sister in danger at home. She then returns home to find that everything is fine and that she will have to know what happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing that works almost but does not work. not quite. I can not really understand why it did not work out, but it was good enough that I wish it was better, or at least I had the little things like having girls playing the twins in the flashback. to be closer in size. I think maybe that's what's wrong with that there are a lot of little things that are wrong.
