The naked body of Ursula Andress is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the housekeeper) also have large bodies. So why is the top rating I can give to a movie with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, to reach Ursula's incredible body, we have to watch an otherwise insignificant and boring movie (keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American version that cuts probably a lot of movies). foreign matter). In the typical Italian comedy tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army monster, "the Latin lover", the constant drunkard, the naive maid) who are not funny, but simply excessive. Last word: watch this, but hold your finger on the fast forward button, you will need it. (*)
