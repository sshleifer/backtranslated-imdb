Phil the Alien is one of those original films where humor is based on the strangeness of everything rather than real punchlines. <br /> <br /> At first it was very strange and quite funny, but I did not find funny jokes or strangeness. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget movie (it's never a problem in itself), there were some very interesting characters, but eventually I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine this movie could please a stoner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but you better try "Brother from a another planet"
