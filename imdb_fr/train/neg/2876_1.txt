I wonder about the motives of the creators of this fictitious account of the motives of BTK's killer. Do they try to describe animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think the people involved in this monster are suffering enough? What a flagrant lack of respect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experience: what bother you the most, the slaughterhouse or the human killings? They used the real name of some of the victims ... This movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
