"A Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There is something about Mary" or "Meet the parents", but gives the impression of being out of the rejection of these two films. Fortunately, I rented it for a 5-day rental because I could not sit more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The place is ok and I liked the scenes where other guys cover themselves automatically. Paul's missteps (the checker at Save-mart was great) but the writing of the script is absolutely horrible. The dialogue goes flat most of the time and just when you think things will finally unfold, a useless visual gag is blocked for no good reason. Plus, how many toilet jokes does a movie really need? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, burlesque humor is awesome when it's smartly done like in the other movies I mentioned, but it's just missing. Too bad because I like Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate for you was great) but even that could not help me get through this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent "There is something about Mary" once again.
