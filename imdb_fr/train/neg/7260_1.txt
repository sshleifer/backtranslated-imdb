"A Town Called Hell" (aka "A Town Called Bastard"), an Anglo-Spanish coproduction, was created in the wake of Clint Eastwood's success in the Italian trilogy "Man With No Name". The model used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and doubling their voices. This film is no exception, apart from the fact that they have also used British actors. <br /> <br /> It's hard to summarize the plot, but there you go. The story begins with the rebels or something else, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, attacking a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. A few years later, in the city in question, the character of Shaw pretends to be a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think of justice with his weapon. <br /> <br /> Add to that a distressed widow, Alvira (Stella Stevens), who seeks that of her husband. killer. Add to that the fact that she walks in a dead hearse like a coffin for God knows why. After the assassination of the mayor by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is invaded by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I'm sorry but the name does not escape me) . The colonel seizes the city and begins to summarily execute the inhabitants to compel them to reveal the identity of the chief. <br /> <br /> Even if they opened the film side by side, it is difficult to say from the dialogue Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims to be able to identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does it and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the directors regretted making this film. It's just awful and worthy of my rating "1" so dreaded. Shaw spends most of the film staring at the one who is useful. Even Landau can not save this movie. The beautiful Mrs. Stevens is totally lost here too. Having just done Peckinpah's "The Cable Hogue Ballade" the year before, I found it strange that she would appear in this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these images ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express", it comes to mind) during the period before Kojak. Michael Craig is also listed somewhere as a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns", although he appears to play the villain in both films of "French Connection". Al Lettieri would also emerge with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and move on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the version I watched lasted only 88 minutes. Rather than the longer 95 or 97 minutes shown on IMDb, I do not see where 7 or 8 extra minutes would make a big difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one.
