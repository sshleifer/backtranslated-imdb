Where to begin, this film started badly and ended badly! It consists of extremely mediocre effects and unrealistic effects that made me tremble in my seat. Seriously, my cat could have done better than this spell. <br /> <br /> Some of these effects were laughable, because it was so incredible, would be less well rated but they have nothing else! So, consider my warnings, and unless your boredom is boring you so much and you want a good reason to continue your suicide mission, do not bother with it. I am always shocked that this can be made public, that it is a crime and that all those involved are arrested. I guess you've figured out the basics now, so I'll let you decide.
