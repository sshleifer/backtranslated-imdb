I saw that on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the movies to see that and spend money on renting. The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the snaking power cables. The plot is really weak and incredible - the expert avalanche guy is hit by an avalanche of 20-foot avalanches (using live images) and he just has to get up and shake himself. The avalanche hits millions of kilometers an hour and comes to a standstill on the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the avalanches are impressive and demonstrate devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the film staged makes this film even more fragile. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with this one, not even on T.V.
