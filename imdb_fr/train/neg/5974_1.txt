Let me start by saying that it does not look like or look like a movie. It seems like it's just another TV show about popular girls and boys without real filmic language. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is so simple that the story is told in the simplest way possible without ever making the accessible public connect with it. This film takes us where no film I've ever seen has done: in a realm where the cinema becomes a warm way offering the public all the elements of interpretation. Too obvious The big cinema screen is only used as an enlarged television where you can see each attribute of these women in a larger than life way. <br /> <br /> Lately, it seems that young directors are compromising the art of making cinema for Sales. It's very scary. The industry spoils the art in the movies. We must inform our children and ourselves about what cinematography and its language really are. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch pad for young divas and jocks.
