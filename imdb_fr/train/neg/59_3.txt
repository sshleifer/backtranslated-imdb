Protocol is an unlikely movie whose only benefit is that it stars Goldie Hawn and many other actors. The story revolves around a ditezy cocktail waitress who became famous after inadvertently rescuing the life of an Arab dignitary. The story declines halfway through the film and the charm of Goldie simply does not record this movie. Unless you are a fan of Goldie Hawn, be sure to see this movie.
