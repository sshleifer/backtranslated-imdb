This film is by no means funny, it tries to be funny with its lame humor, so dry and boring that the film is only two hours of torture. During the whole movie, I thought of one thing: "when will it finish"? One thing you need to give them is that they have very few fun moments, and that's why I gave them 2 stars. He is not original and uses almost all the old jokes of the book, even those that were not funny the first time. It is essentially a film that belittles blondes and records all the repetoir of jokes on blondes. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film is a blond humor that went wrong, it is not worth paying a sum look, it's just that bad.
