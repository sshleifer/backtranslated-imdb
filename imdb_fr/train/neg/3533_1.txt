Let this film sound the death knell for the "big twist" movies born in the 1990s. Known in some circles as the Kyser Soze Syndrome, this cinematic hand has now been made to death by Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard. used a variant of A BEAUTIFUL Mind. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna") uses the Soze motif in a much more obsequious way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with very questionable hair) is played by Jack Green (known as "Mr. Green"). It may or may not be Mr. Gold's criminal brain. Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can own members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most overflowing examples of cinematic excesses that I have not struggled with long enough. Observe the fractured temporal structure, the painful cuts, the incessant internal monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This "Everything and the kitchen sink" style of direction gives Quentin Tarantino's work an attractive appearance. The cinematographic smoke and the mirrors make me think that Ritchie was as bored as I was about telling this banal story. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with so-called shocking moments of revelation, but they only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to love Green because I still enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he struggles as a catch-up reader in a course of English literature at the university. His lack of wit is matched only by the lack of restraint of his nemesis Macha (Ray Liotta). Feasting on landscapes like a hungry man in front of a smorgasbord, Liotta spits, cries and breathes through the film in an embarrassing display of surfacing and leopard-print speedos. <br /> <br /> There is no quality that buys REVOLVER. It's yet another fake Ritchie film and could even surpass his miserable remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film to date.
