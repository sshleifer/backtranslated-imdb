Well, thank you very much Disney for destroying the memories I used of my old favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original movie was released, and it was one of the first movies I can remember seeing. So, now that I'm 16 years old and I feel pretty masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. So, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this excuse for the movie. This film takes everything that made the original endearing and destroyed in every detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and will show it to everyone in the ocean ... STYLE BROADWAY! After the music number ends, a few minutes later, the sea witch, Morgana, introduces herself and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. Thus, he abandons her without even fighting. Eric is speechless, although Ariel knows how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never approach the sea until Morgana is intercepted. <br /> <br /> Well ... nothing serious really happens. Eric is a rascal. He can never really do anything. Ariel is doing something. Melody manages to ruin everything. In addition, animation is a new weak point for Disney. Computer images eventually clash with backgrounds. A unique opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure that even little children will be bored with their skulls, since nothing happens in a very exciting way. They will not want to sing the songs. If you manage to get a copy, throw it into the ocean and hope nobody ever finds it. Already.
