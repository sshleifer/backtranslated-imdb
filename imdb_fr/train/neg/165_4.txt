Although it is too early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot project was less than I thought. There is still potential for the series, though. Of course, when I saw Voyager for the first time, I thought he had potential, but I was deeply disappointed. My instinct tells me, however, that Enterprise will not be as serious as Voyager. <br /> <br /> Regarding the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the show were interesting, with advanced exploration and an appropriate theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> The downside is that the story lacked the "feeling" of embarking on a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was rather a "generic" story of Trek with the themes of "exploration" and "first step to space" simply subplot and subtext. If you removed the references to this first mission in deep space, the plot would be difficult to differentiate between Enterprise, TOS and TNG eras. The central plot did not reflect or do justice to the big theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The launching plot of the first mission would have been big enough without "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgia and philosophy about it (oh, for a TV show that would make us think again). Make us feel the excitement of "the wind" and be on "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of shooter games. There were MUCH too many cannon shots. <br /> <br /> We had more of a feeling that humans were the "freshmen" of a traditional school. New children on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed at our door instead of we found them. This meeting could have been much more historical and much more sociological. How do two different societies interact? Do not refer to this, SHOW IT! <br /> <br /> I had to consider it more like a "Trek with a clumsy crew and a limited technology" as opposed to "brave first steps into the unknown". I wanted to see something newer and cooler. The series promises to have a new concept, but I have not seen this new concept yet. <br /> <br /> I will end by reaffirming the feeling that the series has potential. There are interesting characters. Bakula is beautiful. Blalock has potential. The general theme is the most interesting since we saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes could do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we would have a show that would create new legends. <br /> <br /> You throw an arrow in the air ... Good luck, Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> Producers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND WE THINK * THINK! :-)
