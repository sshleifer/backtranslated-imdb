My friends and I rented this movie last night and we had one of the biggest laughs of all time. The movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it is so ridiculous and unrealistic. First of all, Phillippe (I forget how his character is called and I have nothing to do with it) uses his usual employee ID to review all the high security terminals. It is not only pathetic, but it is successful when his enormous efforts led to the discovery of the very frightening Lego room that houses supercomputers. It's just funny. The tense atmosphere that we are supposed to feel is completely ruined by the childlike room. The end, like everyone else, is very very old-fashioned, especially when the bad guy's lawyer arrives "on time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun of, definitely see.
