I have read all the rave reviews here and I am impressed by the imagination of those who loved this film. I can not say that I found a lot to recommend it. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not only excessively heavy but also dismal. The film looks pretty authentic, but something has to happen for it to work, and nothing works: a superficial plot (it's not a problem for me), not a lot of character development , nothing by theme. It's just slipping. As shabby as it is, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has some moments of real wonder and is a film that I would rather watch again. For a brilliant redesign of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is far superior to "McCabe".
