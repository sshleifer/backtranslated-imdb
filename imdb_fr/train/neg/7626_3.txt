After hearing praise for this film for years, I finally decided to praise it and watch it. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the rental was free at the local library. This movement was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot was meaningless. After 2 hours, I was ready to attack this Texas backcountry town and pull the band out of their misery. I realize that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand the hype that I heard about this movie. Dallas has provided as good a detail of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to critics to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
