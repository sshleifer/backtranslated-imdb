Characteristic of the cinema of the beginning of the 21st century, which makes it possible to confront different evil and evil creatures. We have not seen that kind of thing since Godzilla against King Kong, etc. When you combine quality elements, always sounds perfect on paper. You have an inspired idea and you see everything playing before you love Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write it. Good ideas like all vampires are women. Ergo hot, seductive mortal but in a way I want to perish somehow. And all zombies are men. well what are men with a woman right after she's been dumped or deceived, right? So, everything seems good to really make it. Then, the rot begins to settle. Most people have to fight. Nothing is happening. Another fight. Philosophical Noodling and Cod. Eureka we found how to win. Big fight again and end. Sounds good does not it? If it was an independent company, it would be great. But it's Hollywood that has the eye on money: a brilliant instead of what fans want. All this could have been gore soaked in beauty.
