A warning to potential spectators: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic "The Most Dangerous Game", look elsewhere. "Seven Women for Satan" <br /> <br /> does superficially address the original work using the name of Zaroff and invoking the character who kills people. <br /> <br /> Some of the following could be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor hunted men because they were the only truly difficult prey, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film goes from stage to stage with a lack of clarity almost total. The director seems to have totally ignored the rhythm and left the viewer with a stifling movie. Some individual scenes are slightly interesting (like a torture sequence), but the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are <br /> <br /> more interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at various stages of undressing might find the film watchable. Most people will probably find their time better looking at Mentos ads. <br /> <br /> In addition, DVD extras include a good amount of information about the movie's story. Apparently, he was banned for several years in his native France, which has almost ruined his chances of large-scale distribution.
