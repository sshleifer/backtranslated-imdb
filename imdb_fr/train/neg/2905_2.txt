The expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie. After all, I thought Steve Carell could not go wrong with great movies like Anchorman, The Virgin, 40 and Little Miss Sunshine. Damn, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'll start with what's right with this movie: At times, Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely due to the fact that he is given the leeway to do his thing. He is an undoubtedly talented individual, and it is unfortunate that he signed what turned out to be, in my opinion, a real train accident. <br /> <br /> That said, I will discuss What went wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three daughters who is considered for a nationally endorsed counseling column. He prepares his daughters for a family reunion, during which his relatives gather for a while. <br /> <br /> The family is at the top of the list of elements that make this film a dreadful film. No family behaves like that. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or leaving it at Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think of being a family when we are 7 years old. This reaches the point where they become unpleasant and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword competitions, family bowling and talent shows ARE NOT THE ACTUAL MANNER OF PEOPLE. It's almost disgusting. <br /> <br /> Another big flaw is the woman for whom Carell is supposed to fall. Watching him in his first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim rehabilitate himself. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman who seems slightly retarded. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this film is taking place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After thinking, I do not think it was a lot.
