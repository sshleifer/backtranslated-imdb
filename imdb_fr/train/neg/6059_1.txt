I must say as a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you have this point of sale. I can not logically think that he has made any effort in this area, as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least, his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it did not look like a movie. It was as if someone else had directed it for one thing. I will not believe that Carpenter has made any effort in this area. <br /> <br /> I just heard the soundtrack of his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog and it was great, especially at the time. <Br /> <br /> He used a style that nobody owned and it worked so well for his movies.
