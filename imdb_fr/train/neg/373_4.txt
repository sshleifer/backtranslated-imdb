Blank Check is a movie I saw on TV one day and, like most movies on TV, Blank Check was not very good. First of all, no one I met has ever seen a blank check and that includes people who grew up in the 90s. Also, the blank check will not be retained in the 2000s, all simply because it will be overshadowed by Pixar's films. I would not call Blank Check a bad movie but it's not really fun either. (Or at least, this is not the case for people over 6 years old). The blank check is not an entertaining film because there is nothing original. Everything just makes you leave "what did not I see before?" Blank Check rips and tries to touch everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which is quite strange for Macaulay Culkin). Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to sink in the dark.
