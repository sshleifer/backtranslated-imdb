This film was fine, but it certainly refutes the claim that homosexuals are "born like this", especially when a woman can come out of an unhappy marriage and fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems like Kate's gender preferences are turned on and off like a switch, making this movie a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> Also, as is common with movies trying to advance an agenda, it was unfortunate. that movie characters who had questions or disapproval of the gay lifestyle were labeled as "bigots". And there was no middle ground. It was either Kate's friends and family who had totally kissed her, or they had totally avoided her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay parents and friends. It's usually a mix of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It's possible to love people and treat them with respect without necessarily endorsing the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these interactions. For a movie trying to represent tolerance and acceptance, it seemed very intolerant! Then, in the end, Kate apparently decides after all these years to want to be with Mac and everything is crazy! Is this really gaiety? Come on!
