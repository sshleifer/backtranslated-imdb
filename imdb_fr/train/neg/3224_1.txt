When I was a kid, I remember watching him by visiting a friend of our "uncle" Phil. We are back! The story of a dinosaur is a cartoon on a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little dinosaur how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live there. He explains that it was part of the thing that brought them back with friends. The wicked Doctor / Professor in this movie may have been responsible for their return, but I do not care about him. The kids might like that, but personally, it's too old-fashioned. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
