Ugh! Another of these DVDs "fooled by the cover". I was expecting an action at least with bears, cats, etc. on the cover. I did not understand! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to look at all this thinking that something would finally happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now, the reason I gave this to a 2 is because of the landscape; otherwise it was bad. <br /> <br /> The kid was awful, he was talking to himself (although I guess they could not just shoot a movie with silly music and no dialogue), making his lame karate positions in front of a stump tree, threatening a raccoon, munching worms, and (what a fool) kicking a porcupine. And he would not pull those quills so easily either ... they stick like hooks. At least he fought (weakly) against the bear a few times. <br /> <br /> What happened with the flashback? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a film about survival, not a dramatic film about a child who was a victim of divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have asked the bear to eat the child or something. At least it would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time with this one.
