First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in cinema ... <br /> <br /> The 2007 comedies I liked: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br /> Comedies 2007 I hated: Evan the Almighty, Salomon brothers, Chuck good luck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turn off "Hot Rod" after about 20 minutes . I already knew that this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I do not know at all how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb. Anyone over the age of 10 who appreciates this must be some kind of mentally retarded person. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can not wear longer than a 5-10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they persuaded Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this film ... they had to have favors or something. I arrived knowing that it would be a silly movie, but I thought it would be funny at least. I did not even smile. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not comment on IMDb movies, but it was so horrible that I had to warn people. This is only the 4th movie I saw that I felt obliged to rate 1/10.
