You will immediately recognize the plot. Girls of a divorced couple trying to find mom and dad. Yes, it was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But here's the spooky thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills when she was a lovely girl, Durbin looks a lot older, just like adults. And all his so-called brothers and sisters do the same. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child is found throughout the film. The girls are dressed in pretty little sailor outfits, but they look ridiculous because the director seems to take care to indicate their tops and sleeves ample throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "flirt" them, you feel like pedophiles, and you may be one too to have noticed those ups and downs that the director had reported. Teen girls or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you never know exactly what you are supposed to think of them. <br /> <br /> Parents also look very old and the whole movie looks very dated. <br /> <br /> This is a rusty version of the parental trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus vaccines are up to date if you do not believe me.
