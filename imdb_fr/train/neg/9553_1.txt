No wonder this DVD came out right on DVD here in Australia, no feature has ever been used. The dialogue was hokey, the acting, dreadful and the script was bad !! Anyone would have thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up on John Badham's much better movie, Wargames of the '80s, well, they had to be on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good in her interest for the pleasure of the eyes / love, while Matt Lanter was good in the other main role - that's about it. I would not recommend anyone to Wargames: The Dead Code, take a look at Hackers or the original Wargames movie: both are better than this shit!
