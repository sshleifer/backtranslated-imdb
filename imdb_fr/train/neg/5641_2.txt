Predictable, told a thousand times, with the usual drama between the two, two pretty scenes of hot sex mixed with paranoia of characters, a music of horror of accidental violin in the style of the 70s which is sometimes comical, I could not to stop me from laughing. I usually like Defoe, and I must say that the acting is not so bad, the "plot" is developing at a reasonable pace and prevents you from guessing from time to time. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt like I was watching a fiction made for television rather than a new movie. This is perhaps the style desired by the directors, but it must be said that the criticism I read before seeing the film can only be written by a person involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect that. too much, and if I could go back in time, I would not have gone to see him at the movies. I would wait for the good deals in your video store, I'm sure it will not take long.
