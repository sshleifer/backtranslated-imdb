Honestly, I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever experimented with a film that literally does not contain meat or potatoes. The whole movie felt like it was just a salad without a main dish. The scenario was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was at the window and the animation was performed by four-year-olds. Does it cover? I have never been so embarrassed for a concept of my life. I have never read the comics or seen other programs of this character, but from the observation of other critics, I am not disappointed by my observation. <br /> <br /> For starters, the story was too fast. For someone new to this character and in some situations, I had to better integrate the creation of the reasons instead of finding the solution. I have seen other anime (if you could call this one anime) who do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing set aside for Lady Death. In a few short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive beast of hell. It was difficult for me to swallow, given the previous moments, she was presented as this weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, she is immersed in hatred and can fight against an existence that lasts for millions of years. It was absurd. The presentation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least. I felt like she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with a mental vengeance. For me, it did not work. It was nothing more than powder to the eyes for the prepubescent boys who wanted to ogle the massive amounts of skin she had suddenly developed on her chest when she was training with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick watching her. The same goes for the Cremator character. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough and I ended up with a babbling more incoherent than the actual development. It's a very sad day in hell when we renounce the characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature film. <br /> <br /> Then there was Lucifer himself. Let me just say that I think I could fight the king of hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was laughable and he just did not represent the image I had in my head. It was like Disney was in control and wanted to do it semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of hell, but rather a lackey who had more room to live. Speaking of life and death, how can you still die in hell? It was a concept that certainly needed more explanation. Most characters were afraid of dying, even though they did not even think they were dead. That's how they arrived in hell. I think it's this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. I did not quite get the idea that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but could it be just me ?? or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, just to prepare. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation of this drawing seemed to have been made in the early 90's. The way this film was drawn is not impressive. Why are we, America, so late on animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's kind of hardcore here because we keep making movies like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad. The animation associated with dreadful voice work was cheap. I had the head somewhere that this film was in production for a long time, which is difficult to understand because I think I could have made this movie with my credit card. The production was horrible as well as the story. Nothing has been developed, leaving huge holes of gaping intrigue in which almost everyone has fallen. The strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained. I lost my time with this one and I would like to warn others so that when Death comes, you will not find yourself in my condition and you regret that you have lost 80 minutes on this trash. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Grade: * on *****
