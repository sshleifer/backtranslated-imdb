This film is written by Charlie Higson, who has already directed the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of the characters of Fast Show (Tony the car salesman). He has also written James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I only saw Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories before, and each of them is wonderful. Here, Gordon is trying to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cut, cool chill-out music in the background. It works pretty well here, I suppose, but it's still useless and cheap. This often makes me think of the cameraman who shakes his camera dv in front of the actors / actresses and tries to make elegant movements in the images (hoping that something will be tolerated). The cast is good and there is an atmosphere that results from a good staging. I think that the main character, the young "zero", is quite interesting in his "zerone". The big is as good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but is not him. But shortly after the beginning of the film, the film turns out to be something less interesting: in this case, I mean a succession of endless scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: it's totally pessimistic and every character in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor either. It is a vomit of 1'40 without any relief at any time. In any case, Gordon remains for me one of the most interesting filmmakers who are now active, and I consider this film as an experiment and as a failure. Everyone must sometimes get lost, just to learn and find their way. This could be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty work.
