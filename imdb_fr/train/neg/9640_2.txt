I have always been curious to know if this movie was hard to find. When I came across Ebay, I paid $ 10 and bought it. I now understand why it's so rare! This film is so bad, so terribly written and so small budget that the end credits, which shows all the cinematic scenes where they have escaped their lines, is literally the highlight of the film. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, interpreted for obvious reason, his bare-breasted scene) who uses his powers with an experimental machine to extract objects from another dimension in this reality. When she arranges a box like an object, the army lays it nonchalantly in the back of a truck with a soldier to keep it, and what do you know? SURPRISE! A child dressed in a foam rubber monster costume appears, instantly kills the soldier by gratifying him, and then fled to a nearby city. But instead of deploying half of the county's armed forces to find it and protect the public, officials leave it to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it for themselves, but no matter, this film ALWAYS suffers from its credibility . It hardly avoids being elected by me just because of involuntary laughter. Someone must alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
