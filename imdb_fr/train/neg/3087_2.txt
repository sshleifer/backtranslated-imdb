Laughing puppets torment a group of extremely unpleasant extreme holes that some night watchman kept locked in a trunk for twenty years, for no reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie. simply from ribs on the MST3K film. But I saw the movie itself and I can say without fear that it's bad, really, really bad. From one of the most dreaded "fight" scenes I've ever seen to "alien" stuffed animals that suffer from lack of movement (I had a monster my pet that was more scary) up to the game it was horrible (I had my animal monster that was more charismatic) However, that being said, the films of Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" are somehow, and believe me, I do not know how, much worse . This does not mean that this film is anything but shit, because it is not the case. Just throw it there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: no nudity in the film itself, but there are 2 pairs of tits in the DVD Introduction to the film <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> > <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Gallery of stills; and trailer for this movie
