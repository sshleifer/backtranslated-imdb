I had read some positive reviews about this movie and was really surprised how awful it was. Positioned as a mix between an AIDS story and a kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" tale, this film can not always decide what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a homosexual couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon can have anonymous (although safe) sex whenever he wants. Mark is HIV-positive and Simon and he do not seem to have sex anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who has the habit of cutting his emotions after being rejected by his father years ago - tries to erase his memory and continue to be single. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and foils his various conversations, while forcing Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such an egotistical SOB that you can not feel empathy for him. most of the movie. By the time he's supposed to be more friendly, it's too late to care. On the other hand, Mark follows in the footsteps of "Ghost" Demi Moore crying profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a strange change of tone after Mark's return. Suddenly, we have humble attempts at humor, as in the television show "Bewitched". But it does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, everything becomes increasingly gloomy, with amateur attempts to jerk your heart. The finale, with a gold-plated, muscular angel guiding a crying Mark to the sky, while Simon, stunned and grieved, says goodbye to him, waved goodbye, it's just amazing, mostly because it's not intentionally funny.
