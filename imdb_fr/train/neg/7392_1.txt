I look around me in the video store, still in shock. How can Steven Seagal, with his track record of action films Bad, still have 3 films on sale in less than a year? The attacking force is the third no less promised at the first entry into the Sci Fi Genre for our increasingly larger Seagal. Visions of bad movies paraded before my naive eyes. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all without entertainment and a film as bad as they come. <br /> <br /> Seagal bounced a little bit with the trashy but enjoyable Shadow Man the last time we saw it.However, the attacking force must be its worst movie of all time! Do not argue for a Kill, a Ticker or even Black Dawn. bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says that Steven Seagal is back in shape should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. Seagal is yet another agent / Lawson wants revenge for the assassination of his team which leads him to a harmful conspiracy to distribute a really bad drug to a non-public thinker. Not to mention the dealers are not from here. <br /> <br /> The entire production of the theater is mediocre.Is this film shot in the dark? It must be the poorest film since Howling 2.The action is terrible and very poorly done. <br /> <br /> The producers also made the wrong decision to do what the fans hate the most: throwing in a double stunt after a dubbed waterfall and horribly nicknamed Steven Seagal. show little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> While it was said that Attack Force was not the film signed by Stevie for (originally Harvester) and surely had to be better than the Attack Strength. Falsification of production did not make it more consistent and did not make Seagal worse. I feel bad for the director Michael Keusch and the writer Joe Hal pin as they will be judged forever for the misguided production re-shootings. <br /> <br /> So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to find something to atone for this mess.But after seeing how Bad Attack Force turned out we really want him to make another movie ?
