Private practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So, I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality of the medical stories. Just looking at House, I "solved" two medical mysteries before the doctors.

By the way, the thinking character is a psychiatrist - the story is so unrealistic that you can not really buy the so-called "drama". <br /> <br /> And I'm not even going to complain about what the series did to Addison, everyone's favorite, as we knew it in Gray's Anatomy ... In summary, do not you think it's funny how Addison ends up coveting the loser, Pete insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, doctor or not) and Derek ends up getting tangled up in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith, miles away from Seattle in the rain? Aside from this little adventure with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think that Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one ...
