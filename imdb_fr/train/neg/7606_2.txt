The garland Beverly was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace to films as lame as Corman's films in which she played. In Gunslinger, she is the sheriff's wife of the city. He gets fired, so she takes office to pursue his killers. She is better than the material she works with from a distance. The film is gray, scalded and mostly boring. There's a bit of humor (unintentional) with tire tracks everywhere, people running behind a building to suddenly emerge in front of another (I've heard about false fronts, but that's ridiculous!), And the really stupid plot of the new widow The sheriff fell in love with the guy hired to kill her. Even though she did not like her husband, it had only been about a week or two since her death! And she ends up killing the guy in the end, anyway. No luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the room is another woman, the owner of the living room. She plans to buy a pile of land in case the railway crosses and enriches it. If her plan leaves her wanting, she will only fly as much as she can to the city and the shovel. Hell, it's just her and her rented gun in the end against an entire city. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? Look what happened in real old west cities when bank robbers came to steal the bank, then were shot in the rain by bullets by armed and dangerous city residents. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unnecessary discussion and overlap, interspersed with a few lame shootings. The end is as sinister as usual in a Corman movie, although thank God it lacks the moral proselytism in the end that was in It Conquered the World. The sheriff gives his badge to Sam Bass and goes out at sunset, even if the film was so gray that you have never seen the sun.
