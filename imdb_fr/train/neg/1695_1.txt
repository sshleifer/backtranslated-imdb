OK, when I saw the previews of this movie, I found it really scary and I was very happy to see it, just like the band I was with. Now, I live in America especially during this election, but I must say that these glimpses were at the top of the list. I do not see how so many people could be scared by this film. I only really noticed two real jump scenes and I jumped to only one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe that upset some of the jump scenes for me. As for the so many sound effects to be so scary, I thought they were at best comical. Oh and boy Cath where does he come from and why? The worst sound of all the film was to be the strange groan. How does this scare someone? I can make this noise easily. Now, do not get me wrong, I've always loved all those really awful movies that make you laugh all through the movie, but I did not even think this one was so lucky, it was just bad.
