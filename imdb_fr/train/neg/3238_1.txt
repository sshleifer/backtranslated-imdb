Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories: those with a semblance of intrigue (Gee, it's a lucky pizza boy) and those who do not have one (Anal Amateurs 36) . The devil's experience falls firmly into the last category. <br /> <br /> This is of course the horror version of hardcore. A conspiracy almost completely less than 43 minutes waiting for the money. Shot on video in 1985, it is about three Japanese boys, relatively undetermined, who torture an unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from banal (slapping 50 times giving him a hundred shots), ridicule (attaching to an office chair and rotating it), the fear factor (a bath of eggs and guts). sheep) and finally the money shot. (A well executed eye piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no conspiracy, no motive, just Blair Witch blows and torture. The girl looks bored and aside screaming: "Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition" during the office chair scene, I was bored stupid. Looking at the screen stunned, waiting for the shot. Just like hardcore porn.
