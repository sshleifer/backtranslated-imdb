I rented this movie for a reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a disappointment, I had horrible pictures, half of the film was composed of naked women called "fallen angels" who were trying to make afraid, oh there were occasionally camera scenes stunned by the black-and-white movement "Blair Witch". Tom's character was really awful, a horrible scenario. And you must love these lines they use. "Is someone there, who is there, it's not funny" No, but your role was. I wish I could give this film a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they left out Anthony. The Breakfast Club meets in the forest of unpardonable acting.
