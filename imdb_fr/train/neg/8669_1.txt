First of all, I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. This is the kind of horror that comes into your skin and sticks to you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I was just hoping this movie would be fine. He has had many opportunities, with an excellent cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, he has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was silent. Much of the horror in the book was lost, Bradbury having to be forced to keep violence to a minimum. All the visuals of the book are gone. Anything that made you feel uncomfortable ... gone. <br /> <br /> And then there is the acting game. Like many movies that Disney launched in the 80s, the kids in this movie can not play. And that bothered me a lot, none of them looked like 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintances. <br /> <br /> One might think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could play this role in their MM roles. Halloway and Dark. But here, it's like they do not care. All they want is to pay off a mortgage or something like that. It's far from being one of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was good as a witch, but the character of the dust witch herself was not well shot. She is much less perverse and does not have the presence as she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything that was left outside the book. The night-time ballooning, Jim's house marking, Mr. Dark's real death, what happened to Mr. Coogan at the ring, the fate of the lightning bar seller, the actual death of the witch and oh so much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The carousel of condemnation of a thing with the superimposed horses that circulated was not really frightening, and this strange green mist that does not really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on to talk about how this movie tore the original novel, but it boils the blood. Do not see this movie but read the book. It's a Bradbury classic.
