I could not believe it! Cut sentences? Good sorrow! Know what? All true! Do real people ever talk like that? Do not believe. Good girl! Big fellow! Tighten the upper lip! The only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. The movie as a whole is ridiculous unless you like to watch endless battles in biplane planes. Seemed endless, anyway. Think that all the dialogues of Franchot Tone are doubled. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to ring British, they become Irish. Practical tip - We, British, cut the words, not the sentences. And one way or another, we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But only if we attended a very good public school (private).
