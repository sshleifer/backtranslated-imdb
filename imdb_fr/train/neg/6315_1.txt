This elegant and sexy film is a must. Only in multiple viewings can we really understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I appreciate the narrator for his intelligent storytelling style, with no unaffected subject. The introduction takes you right away and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the movie. It provides a wonderful insight into the world of workout objects and allows the audience to really "connect" to the internal horror of this movie. The script itself keeps the movie perfectly together. Not only for children, but for the elderly as well, they will better understand the training opportunities and their modern understanding of the sexual experience. Avant-garde and revolutionary in cinematography, he certainly defines the word "masterpiece".
