I'm the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I choose a movie, so I chose five on the eyes. I was disgusted with this movie and I thought there was no script and no one could enjoy it, I hurt myself by thinking that people like to watch movies that are only encourage violence, but damn it was a minimal and very poor budget! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it. The actors were nil. The camera was horrible. The picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, I think it was a little bit like a hangover from the baler project and it did not work at all it was dirty.
