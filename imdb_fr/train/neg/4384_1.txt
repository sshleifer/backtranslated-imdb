The fact that someone has actually spent money on such a bad scenario is beyond me. It really has to be one of the worst movies, besides the Haunted Highway I've ever seen. BAD actors and a very bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even if it's Halloween, normal people would have bigger reactions when they see their father being killed without talking about disemboweled people, with duct tape covering the airways, unable to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people that I could add) and a person disguised as Satan dragging dead people out of his home, even a child 8 years old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could be so naive and stupid to believe in the reality of the appearance of Satan and Jesus the same day, as this kid does. When I was 8, I had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But what is really stupid is that everyone seems to crack for that silent dubet of Satan too, without asking any questions. The question that arises throughout the film is: Is it really Satan or is it a madman who kills people whenever he feels like it? Well, he has human hands, arms, racks and whatever, so I guess he's supposed to be in the movie too, otherwise they did a dirty job to hide it. Then, with this human person and everyone, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) cops (all with guns and training I presume) and a few others people. .... and obviously everyone was just there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and how to tell the story is absolutely the worst thing I've seen, and I would never recommend anyone wasting 1 hour and 30 minutes of his life watching this shit total.
