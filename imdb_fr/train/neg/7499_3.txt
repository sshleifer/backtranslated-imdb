John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a Latino New Yorker, able to enter a myriad of characters, men and women, to show the strange weaknesses of an ethnic group that tries to deal with a foreign culture . He is not Italian, however. He does not look, do not think and does not behave in Italian ... Especially Sicilian or Calabrian immigrant groups living in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. All the scenes in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" sound wrong, as if he had gone astray in a university production of "West Side Story" while the others were doing a "Low Streets" at moderate rent. This is only a problem with this poorly designed and petty film. Spike ruined everything. Btw, CBGBOMFUG stands for "Country, bluegrass, blues and other music for exhilarating gourmets." Ask Hilly Crystal who founded the club. <br /> <br />
