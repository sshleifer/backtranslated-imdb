Have you ever been in front of a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed and you suddenly realize that you have already seen the movie? It happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The video box cover, if you can find the video, is extremely disappointing. I swear the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born ten years too late to appreciate the details of this movie or ... it's just useless junk. I am strongly leaning towards the latter, but I suppose that some have developed a connection with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. A terrain. Let's see ... there must be a plot here somewhere. No, I do not find it. They are mainly high school students doped, drugged and speaking in a language outdated for decades. One of the students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has an icy wife (which he actually calls an iceberg), so he is receptive to the girl's progress. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of driving, a senseless dialogue and many spasmodic dances. Our cat, BooBoo, was pierced by high school students. She watched with incredible intensity the movement of the dancers gesturing and shaking them on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
