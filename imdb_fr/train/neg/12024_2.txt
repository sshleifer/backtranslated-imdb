This is the most annoying nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of relevance and the acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, camera angles that made me sick were used, the casual music was awful and drowned in the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing then), and the plans for San Francisco appeared to have been stolen straight out of the promotional video of the city's tourist board. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the obligatory sex the scene was not even half done well. Better lighting next time, please.
