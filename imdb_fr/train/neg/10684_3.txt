This film was spectacular. I was so emotionally involved in every character that the biggest antagonist of the movie was, in fact, myself. I played it beautifully all the way through; promising to leave, but drinking another beer hoping it would automatically turn into a captivating event. Even in that state, I could not help but notice that Cuban acting was as fragile as tracing paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was thoughtless, as was his one-night frenzy after the failure of his own silly standards. Burt appeared on the screen as a general, that's right, a general (who wears too much makeup). I fell into an extremely fast frenzy to rival that of Cuba, except that mine was real and I crashed my toe. Reward! Reward my crushed toe!
