The complaints are founded, the biggest problem for me is that this serial is too much for women. I agree with these nocturnal soap operas, like Gray's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are interesting stories, even with the belief that they will never end. However, when the idea is parallel to the day's soap operas, which are aimed only at putting delirious men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) in a tension and sexual frolics, as well as in many ridiculous difficult situations in an alleged small hospital, it looks like the general hospital ... or a female counterpart in Baywatch. That's what the men wanted and they had it, so if that's what the women want, so be it, but the idea that it's a tall broadcast (or something that men will look at) is unrealistic.
