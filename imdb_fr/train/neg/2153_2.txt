The 3D character presented in "The man who was not there" means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy features ugly 3D effects that make the 3D effects of "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" more interesting in comparison. Not to mention the film is asinine to the extreme. This film is one of many films from 1983 to present the special effects on the screen. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this mess, but at least that did not kill their career. Tambor would continue to play in HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's box office "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg followed the flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What are they in these projects instead of them here in "The man who was not there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
