This film was like a bad indie with an outstanding talent. The plot was stupid, until the end. It really reminded me of something that was disastrous for the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given one, but there were brief moments when we could see the actors really struggling to make it happen. worth it. I think the worst thing was that the underwater scene was kept away from the wharf. Underwater lighting seemed to come from nowhere, and every time someone we were supposed to be concerned about was going to run out of air, this tank of air appeared somehow. I would avoid that unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Have a good day.
