I knew I was going to see a low-budget movie, but I was expecting a lot more from a Alex Cox movie. The game of the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have won an Oscar for these two. This film was filled with what I suppose to be jokes for film industry professionals and some other jokes that I really understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without those moments of laughter, I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who created all the classics of the 80s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few questions I had after the end of the movie. Why did the Mexican go to the other man's house at first? What did his daughter say he had fired 100 people from his last job? Why was she breaking her own business when she was angry with him? I guess I should have gone to the Q & A after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10am.
