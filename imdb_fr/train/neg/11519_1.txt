It's absolutely the most stupid movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a beautiful casting. It's James Cromwell, the ignorant who plays the role of deputy. I could go on and on, but I would obviously spend more time on this criticism than anyone ever did on the screenplay. The only thing this film is about is us against them and how to revel in a profane stupidity beyond the tolerance of any reasonable human being. It's one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I LOVE James Garner.
