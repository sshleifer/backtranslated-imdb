I would give it a negative note if I could. I went into this movie without waiting too long, but my mind was open. All is stupid! Snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a breasts and a guy. Oh, how original! if I were a boy of 12, I could laugh at it. I do not know at all how this film has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I have ever seen. I did not have fun, it was not funny, I was not bored! I was nothing. It was not so bad that it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Do not even rent this movie. No idea of ​​the quality of this note.
