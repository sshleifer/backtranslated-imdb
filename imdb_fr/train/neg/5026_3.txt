Flame in, flame out. It seems to be Gammera in a word, a prehistoric creature that can take it and distribute it with equal abandonment. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I'm committed to watching every film in the 50-film science fiction film collection created by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It's a good value at about twenty-five dollars, so at fifty cents per film, it really is an investment in time to look at some of the awkward offerings. <br /> <br /> Gammera is moved by a long sleep of several centuries by a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he attacks Tokyo, sparking action by the United Nations to develop a plan to save the planet. They arrive at "Plan Z", the hope of the world, and you would not know it, there is a scene showing a huge hangar called building "Plan Z"; it was a good idea. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1960s, this country was still not politically correct. One of the American military scenes in Alaska's air defense sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there were no soldiers around. <br /> <br /> The good old Gammera was still beautiful to see, walking on two legs and going to the routine of throwing flames when she was challenged. That's why it surprised me to see how Plan Z managed to capture the turtle man in the cone of a hidden spaceship, bringing him to Mars to save the world. All the records of the US and Russian teams that made the backup, let's go back now to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a good dozen movies, but after seeing this one much satisfied my interest in flying and inflamed turtles. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier contains "Attack of the Monsters" with a star appearance of the Big G. It took all I needed to get to the end of both films; It was such a relief to get to the last frame in this one that said "Gammera, Sayonara!"
