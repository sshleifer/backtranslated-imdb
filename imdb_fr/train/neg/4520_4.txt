Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the others were essentially scams from his other series. Some episodes of Swiss Family Robinson have been scams of his older television shows. An episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a party member needs a side operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost contact with television shows after the 1960s. The game is strong with Martin Milner. The star children who arrived there begin with Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption nicknamed him "Master of Disaster".
