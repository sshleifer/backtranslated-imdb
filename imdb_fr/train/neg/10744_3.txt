In the first case, it was mostly giant rats, but there were also wasps and a giant chicken. This, however, is only the period of giant rats, giant rats and a growing little boy. This one talks about this growing boy and a scientist trying to help him so that he accidentally creates giant killer rats ... you know what it is. This film has some exploits and moments, but I think it's at the same level as the original, I just prefer a little variety in my giant creature movies. Well, that's not true ... I actually like "Empire of the Ants", maybe I do not care about giant rodents. All in all, this film is rather dull, even if it presents a rather strange turn in this sequence of dreams really strange. I just can not recommend this one.
