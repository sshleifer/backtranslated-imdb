The film is an extra-long narrative of a classic novel that fails to capture the spirit of the original adventure. The very horrible American Patrick Swayze is interpreted as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the evidence of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues throughout "Hollywood-ise" history by changing the plot and characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The film manages to be predictable, even for those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by extremely bad and terribly disappointing battle scenes. <br /> <br /> In total, a terrible addition to the already rather bad collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain.
