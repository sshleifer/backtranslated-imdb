This film is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone thought that the Garland / Mason version needed to be redone, nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to be the star. <br /> <br /> By the way, I do not know why our compatriots (American homosexuals) tend to generally regard Striesand as a treasure. At least in my opinion, she had peaked professionally with Funny Girl and What's Up Doc from Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and praise Judy's classic, or even the original (a beautiful movie in its own right), but please, please, please avoid this error !
