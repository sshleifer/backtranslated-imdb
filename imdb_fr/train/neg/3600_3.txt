A question for all girls: If a man you had never met before inadvertently called you intentionally and continued to do so at the most intrusive times, would you be intrigued by him or if you panicked? did you call the police? Yes, that's what I thought and so I could not swallow the idea that Marti Gerrard supports Connor Hill's unwavering attention. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid story. The wife of Connor Hill is murdered and the plot revolves around the question does Connor call Marti so he can have an alibi? But there's a huge logic gap here, could not Connor have used a hit man? something that the prosecution seems to have ignored. And was there no forensic doctor on the scene of the murder? So why is the whole case based on the fact that Connor phoned Marti at the time of the murder? Stupid . Stupid . Stupid . And it's also predictable that there is no brain. <br /> <br /> My undying memory of this film is that, for those who participated in the Olympic Winter Games, Marti Gerrard is a really bad skier.
