I've been using IMDb for years and never wanted to get involved in movie reviews - until now. This documentary has so many problems that I do not know what to say. I am neither a Muslim nor an expert in Islamic studies, but I know enough to clarify the obvious point of view of this documentary. <br /> <br /> The problems of this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen are anchored around a few valid points and surround them with questionable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case of Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists in the world, and some of them are Muslims, but building a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is extremely misleading. It's really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to explore more objectively some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that could help. <br /> <br /> The Islam presented in the documentary is not positive. The documentary is focused on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside this region. Believe it or not, there are more Muslims in China than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentary is debatable. I watched the documentary while watching another translation and the differences were striking. I had been warned about the translation used in the documentary and I now know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that the disbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I read instead: "Those who reject the truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in the heat of hell". The difference is that those who reject the truth are those who know God and the truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film mentions that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but it is not true. Although it is true that many things come from the Quran and Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf or" normative behavior ". Clearly, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but 'Urf is supposed to be a' good 'behavior, which an average person would consider fair or false. <br /> <br /> The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as a unified set of knowledge that all Muslims follow. It's just not true. There are many schools of Islamic law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in their interpretation of the law. <br /> <br /> The tradition of hadiths is similar. There are thousands of hadiths and every law school accepts and rejects others. To use the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real, and applicable is to indiscriminately choose quotations from the story that correspond to what you want to say. That's what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> I hope people will understand that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot at doctors from abortion clinics, etc. I know it's not the same thing as a suicide bombing, just understand that the justice of fundamentalism is probably the problem. If you think you have the answer, all others must be wrong. But if you feel that you have an answer, you can work with the opinions of others on politics, religion, God or whatever.
