The film had good actors and good moments (although, obviously, a relatively low budget), but a poor rating due to the poorly developed basic principle. The main point of contention between the two leaders is not at all realistic. There are some scenes where they disagree because of that, but no deep enough discussion could explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since Glenn's job is so annihilated in this part of his life. (and Adam is sufficiently active with his to endure it with time and money.) Moreover, Glenn is repeatedly described negatively as being the way he is (apologizing for Adam for his past) then that it is shown that Adam is standing and traditional. , "that the film proclaims to be the" right "way to the end I do not like to be preached to like it, I attended a discussion with the director after watching LTR, and he said that he had presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn's place (and he said he was actually referring to Glenn's view), he could never go out with someone with the views of Glenn. Well, then, I think he should have done a lot better to explain how Glenn could do it in the movie, and the director said he made that first film after reading Directing For Dummies. The realization was not so bad, but far from an excellent effort, I saw worse, but I rarely leave the movies with such frustration.
