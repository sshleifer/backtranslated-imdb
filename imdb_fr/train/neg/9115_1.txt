If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a real, mean and cruel girl. Look Amy Adams, she's just a little idiot hanging around. She is nothing! People do not love it! Second, Sebastian was cute and sexy in the first movie, now he's "baby face". The story is not very good and I do not understand. Why did not they do this first, that's the beginning. Loosy actors, nothing with history. It's not cruel, it's playing. The first has better actors, a better story and its average. I think the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. This is not the worst movie I've seen, but in comparison with the first movie, its big, big, big nothing.
