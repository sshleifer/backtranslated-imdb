I will give William Gove, screenwriter / director, the credit of having found someone to finance this ill-conceived "thriller". A good argument for not wasting money by subscribing to HBO, not to mention the purchase of DVDs based on covers and presentation texts. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco do not add anything important to their resume, although the art direction is not half bad. The dialogue will leave you wincing in wonder at his vanity; it's the narration at its worst. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. Some attractive and often nude females spice up boredom, but it's certainly a movie to watch as a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who gave the green light to this thing. Good for late viewing and zone only. You were warned.
