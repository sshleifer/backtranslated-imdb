I think it's time for John Rambo to move on and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is aging and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but a cold-blooded killer. Every time he comes on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place and, frankly, I'm tired of making Hollywood believe. This is not the worst film about Vietnam, this honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo carrying a 50-gun machine gun on what appears to be half of the Vietnamese army plus a good number of Russians is an insult to watch. What's worse is Rambos' nerdy speech at the end ... Please !! Oh yes I heard that they made another one ...
