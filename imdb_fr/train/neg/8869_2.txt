With the launch of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry really hit bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived in recent years in peace with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day, an old friend of Stefan arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan has to do a little mail job. He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroin to the Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things are not going as planned in Germany and Stefan is now having big problems. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional pattern of family drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: a bad action, an incoherent plot and idiots dialogues. The only highlight of the film is the unprovoked sexual scene with the incredible beauty of Regina Lund. It only lasts a few seconds, which leaves about 90 minutes of pure, let's say what it really is, shit.
