Frightful horror suite from "The Howling". It starts with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) arrives and tells Karen's brother, Ben (Reb Brown), that Karen was a werewolf. He travels to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the werewolf in the lead. Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario, a bad direction, an inept editing and a really horrible game of Brown and McEnroe flowing alone. The effects of werewolf are mostly kept in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when we see them. Subdimensional special effects too - although I like the cartoon flash that comes from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning removes its top at least EIGHT TIME in the closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the village of Transylvania fun - it looks like it comes from a 1930s horror movie! There are interesting camera turns between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have a good body and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save him. Really - WHY did they do that? Where are they struggling to earn money ??? This is one of the lowest rated IMDb movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly, Danning was horrified when she saw the movie - I can understand why! Do not miss.
