I saw this movie under the title of "Tied Up". In general, I enjoyed Dolph's movies, so try this one. It was not worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the box, attracting viewers. Do not be fooled. It's a mediocre film at best. The acting game is non-existent. The plot, the little that there is one, is very predictable. The film in some places seems to be cut together. This one stinks the place. Not worth the price of a cheap night rental. As a fan of Dolph, I waited to see him in action. At the end of the movie you will still be waiting. Best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost everything else.
