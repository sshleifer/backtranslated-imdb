I'm a little torn by DARK ANGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" tribute to the biggest pin-up ever - but there's so little "content" now that the film itself is virtually useless. I do not really know what is the motivation or the "purpose" of this film - because there is very little biographical information provided in the story - so that those who do not know much Bettie will not know more after to have watched DARK ANGEL either ... <br /> <br /> The film tells the last years of the career of Bettie in the modeling of the bondage. Almost the entire film is composed of "reenactments" of some of Bettie's most famous "filming". These reconstructions alone account for 75% of the production time of the films and give almost no idea of ​​Bettie as a person. The film briefly discusses his legitimate short-term acting activities and his subsequent decision to leave the "trade" and become religious - but all of this is rather obscured in favor of long and long scenes of reenactment ... < DARK ANGEL is not a horrible movie, it has no substance. The other problem is that the actress who plays Bettie really only looks like her in more distant shots - up close, it's impossible. The other thing that irritates me is that although Bettie performed several bare breasted model sessions, the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo at the end credits. The film itself is obviously very small budget, but does what it can and within the limits of the costumes, so without reproach. The acting is quite wood and unthinkable of all involved. In fact, the most memorable thing about the whole movie was to notice, in the credits, that the actor who played the real name of Irving Klaw is Duke Flyswatter. No kidding - check the list of actors. I can not say that I recommend this one too strongly unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and must own everything about it. And if you are as badly off, then you still have to get treatment ...
