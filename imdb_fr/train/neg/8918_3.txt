... luckily he does not have it yet! It is a crude and simplistic student policy transformed into a theater. The viewer must adhere to a series of vanities. Concept 1: A British electorate could have gone from right to center to the far left. Concept 2: All the debates in the media and the general public are closed unanimously and the only critics of the new Prime Minister are the sinister civil servants, the MI5, the big companies and the Americans (naturally). Concept 3: Let this Radical Socialist Prime Minister solve all trade union, economic and social problems with disconcerting ease, in a way that unites the nation. Concept 4: Break all ties with the United States and NATO is a good thing. Concept 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have moved closer to it in the 1980s. And finally, idea 6: That the reactionary forces of the United States are actively seeking to launch a coup d'etat against Great Britain. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous and the series only gained the reputation it had gained by trying to cash in the country and critics of the left-wing television extolling its praise. At the time, television was still a very popular and influential medium, with broadcasts getting huge ratings. A controversial drama, with a hint of controversy, had a good chance of reaching a wide audience. Ray McInally's performance was excellent, which is one of the few positives. History and time have shown the immense weakness of the places and the plot of this show.
