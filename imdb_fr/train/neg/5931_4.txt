This film should have lasted only 10 minutes. I mean there is really only 10 minutes of viewable content in this thing (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film were somehow promising. As the movie begins with short comments from the man himself, you rub your hands and stay tuned for more pictures of Cohen's life. Nick Cave does a reasonable job of taking back one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more Cohen whose wit and strong words have already tickled your fancy. But it turns out Cave's performances are just the beginning of long, boring performances from a group of people who do not even have the slightest attraction to keep you in your seat. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? close-ups of five minutes showing you want to be singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker really think about insulting the public by adding "false applause" to these endless unpleasant performances? The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is not a single sequence from Cohen's past. In fact, apart from some photographs of his debut as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen discusses, even 10 minutes may not have passed. But these 10 minutes are torturously presented, piece by piece, between disastrous camera work that captures some of the less attractive people shouting Cohen's words. If you have already decided to waste your money on this movie, do not do it! just throw it in the trash and save at least your time.
