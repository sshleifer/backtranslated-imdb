I saw his movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I'm very familiar with film. And Crispin Glover's movie is outrageous. It mainly exploits the mentally handicapped. Not only is Shirly Temple the antichrist (which, I confess, is a bit funny), he tells those who have the challenge to kill themselves, but there is an obsession to kill snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who is as they are all, to challenge mentally. PETA and human rights should take center stage. It's not a "counterculture", as Crispin explains at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's an exploitation.
