Painting by numbers, story and mediocre actor's game saved by an authentic color - and a few moments really wonderful and deeply felt. It effectively captures the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood and deals in a very sensitive and inventive way with the cultural conflict that mainly families experience. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good film is imprisoned in a complicated plot that manages to incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict on a road construction project, the sexual life of secondary and even tertiary characters , a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a group of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and so on. And all this does not even include the central plot, which only concerns the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turn of their lives. In fact, I was shocked when I realized that everything was supposed to happen during a summer (and that so many movies were done in an hour and a half!) <br /> <br /> Finally , the film is melodramatic, every plot The point is predictable, major events that upset life occur and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. Even more shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable twist) and is then completely forgiven and the entire incident is now forgotten. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and offer another "twist". All of this is totally mechanical, right down to the end, which perfectly ties all the other things (well, not all, but only those that the film thinks you care about.)
