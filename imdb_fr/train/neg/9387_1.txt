I saw this movie when it came out for the first time. The memory of his gravity has remained almost forty years. I did not want to trust my own feelings about the movie when I saw it. So I consulted the next day a film review published in a major metropolitan newspaper. The feeling has been confirmed. The reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, indecipherable and uninteresting. . A little research reveals that the producer was the husband of star Leslie Caron, so the hint of nepotism suggests the beginning of this horrible film. The list of the film composed of many competent actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking, among others - suggests that it is promising. But the death of this film is attributable to his terrible scenario. The "mystery" involved is so obscure and so little revealed in the film that the viewer is left puzzled from stage to stage. The film seems torn between a police mystery and a spy thriller, but never focuses on one or the other. The sense of suspense is totally absent. The main characters decide to play dry and emotionless types in a way that does not inspire empathy. Cinematography is pedestrian. As a result, the unlucky spectator loses interest in the characters, the plot and, ultimately, the film itself. I am a little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available for purchase. I hope that if TCM finds a copy of this film and feels compelled to post it, it will be relegated safely to the 4 o'clock position.
