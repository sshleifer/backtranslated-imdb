It's the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They are modernizing it unnecessarily and some things are really just sick. <br /> <br /> Songs rarely advance in history. They seem to be thrown at random. The flight scene with Marley is futile and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst films I've seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. It's not because the original story was a classic that adaptation is cheap.
