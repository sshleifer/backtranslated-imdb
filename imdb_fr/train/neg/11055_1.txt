I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair because of a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch the few movies made about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first, I found the main character a bit noble and captivating. His message about people with disabilities and the time he has spent fighting for recognition and inclusion in the mainstream labor market is excellent. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it preaches, that I found it insulting. <br /> <br /> First, they did not assign anyone a lead role with a real physical disability. . Of course, they were competent actors, but it seems completely absurd to preach to hire people with disabilities and not to hire people with disabilities for nothing in the film. In addition, in a scene in the middle of the film, we see a man heading for a podium with crutches, seeming to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What? They could not find an amputee anywhere for the movie? For a 5-second shot, was it more financially wise to do CGI effects than simply to ENGAGE a REAL amputee? At that time in the movie, I found him so fraudulent and completely opposed to the message he was trying to convey that I came here to whine and moan about it as a pathetic cripple that I am. <br /> <br /> Find that.
