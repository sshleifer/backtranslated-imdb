This movie really makes you appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote. It is an exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once, Hamilton opts relatively easily for blurry photos. However, what I found difficult to understand about the film is that even though Anja Schüte was around 19, the girls are described much younger than they actually are. The whole story of Lolita, especially that an older man is involved, leaves me rather uncomfortable. In reality, the heroine is shaved in the pubic area to make her even younger. Come on, sex is a good time spent between consenting adults. Another thing I found strange is that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the movie, well, not at all.
