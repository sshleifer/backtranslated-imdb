This film presents a whole range of characters and their relationships in the first half an hour or so. None of them generates interest or positive response. I was waiting for the plot to begin, hoping things would get better and end up staying until the bitter end, but there was no reward for that. <br /> <br /> If you want a summary, look elsewhere. For me, the action is not worth telling. It's not that the story is so bad, I guess you could say I had some problems with the script - that is. I thought it smelled bad. A look at the credits will show you that there is a cast strong enough here, used in vain. Most of the old pros in this movie do a good job. actors that I had not seen much before, I particularly liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all I can find good about this picture.
