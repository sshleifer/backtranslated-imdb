Lynne Ramsey creates striking images and Samantha Morton can appeal to a feeling. So what a trail to discover their lost talents on this pretentious lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not give life to Callar. His attempts are too artistic and oblique. Time and time again, her camera lingers on the silent long shots of the distressed actress, as if Morton's only obliterated look could give character. We are in an unscrupulous warhol hell: for a movie that has a few minutes to lose against insects that crawl on the ground, you might think that it could resolve to flesh out its protagonist. But how will it be if she seldom speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, Celluloid Morvern Callar is no one. It is not surprising that Ramsey asks Morton to undress often. <br /> <br /> That said, the first ten minutes have been played, turned and climbed so impressively that my hopes have soared. Give as much to the film: he knows how to make promises, if not how to hold.
