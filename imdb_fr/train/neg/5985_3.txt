This movie is just a kid against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is the perfect way to get people to see it, but its use is almost incidental. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a ploy to attract the public. It was interesting to note what the directors' view of the future of London would be and how the world fit together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is made up of some of the very comical replicas of Lady Penelope. . These provide a slight relief for those who are waiting for a replay of the television series. <br /> <br /> That said, it takes about 90 minutes in a "fun" way and can therefore be worth watching.
