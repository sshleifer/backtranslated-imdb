As some of the other commentators have mentioned before, I would like to know what this idiot actually read the script and went ',' Yes, that's right, that's the next movie we're going to fire on green !!" And whoever this person is, his head should be subject to an analysis of his actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for distributing the money after reading the script, I would like to give you my email address and maybe you would just like to give a little more money. This film is atrocious in every respect. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They made good movies and incredibly fun performances. But here, not only does the premise defy logic, not only is the acting of the actors terrible, but not only is the entire movie offensive from beginning to end, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they wish really. pay to watch this movie. Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would always be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Usually I would be inclined to write a long and detailed critique of why this movie is so bad, but suffice it to say that I will let my conciseness speak. This is the lowest common denominator in filming and is about as insane as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0 / 10..talk my list of the ten worst movies of all time!
