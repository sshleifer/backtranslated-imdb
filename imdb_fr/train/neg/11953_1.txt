Do you know those movies that you have trapped at the movies? You are stuck in the best seat of the house, in the center of the row, in your own special place, which you have traded three times before you find the right seat - and after about 13 hours of use, hurt your comfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F *** is this movie ever going to end ???" (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and the Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q offers a strange variant of this feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to start! It's endless! So "Arty" it hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I watched. Apparently, he's doing movies by the dozen, and if they're all pretentious like that, I guess it'll be the last one. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is one of the top 10 directors for me, but Visitor Q is a pretentious, cheap and ugly w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have already determined, I hated it.
