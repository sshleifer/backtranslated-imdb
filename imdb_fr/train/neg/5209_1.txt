Ok, so I got bored and watched it all the way. <br /> <br /> This film is soft, harmless and dull. The story is so sweet that it hurts your headlines. A tail of two "traumatized" children teaches "God" the way of a fairy tale that frankly left me rather traumatized. He uses the Irish "blarney" in such a stereotyped way that it is hoped that no real Irishman will ever see it. Aimed at children who, frankly, would go out after the first attempt of an "OIRISH" accent. Overall, why are they pumping them?
