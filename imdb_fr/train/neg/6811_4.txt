When I first saw this movie at the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I always think that staging and cinematography are excellent, as is music. But it really is the scenario that over time began to annoy me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's writing selfish and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a secondary character, a second violin to her much too old, far too harsh Elinor - in the film we give her several kinds of "focal moments", and often, they seem to be there just to show Thompson herself even. <br /> <br /> I understand that she has cut several characters from the book, leaving aside the scene where Willoughby is redeemed in the book? For those who love the book long before the film, these are things that are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet in the role of Marianne. We do not give her the best screenplay in the world, but she always picks it up with elegance, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is awesome, a little old maybe, but he plays the role perfectly. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as always.
