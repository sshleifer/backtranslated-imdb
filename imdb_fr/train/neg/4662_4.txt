The writers probably had no military experience and probably never had a look at a history book, but I still give this cheap war movie the credit of have taken a critical look at the role of black soldiers in the Second World War. The action is confusing and unbelievable - any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the distribution is interesting. See NYC giant Rosie Greer was worth the price I paid for it. The art direction is in fifth place - the men are wearing the Korean War uniform and the weather was pretty gloomy at the time the US military arrived in Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I do not do not think the field looks like Northern California. . The scenario never says why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1, whose second-rate troops would probably have been issued. <br /> <br /> This basic idea of ​​history (a racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been extended to a big-budget production at the time, and it was not too late to try it now. You have to take that for what it is, and I admire the creators of this movie for making the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him some time ago and thinking that it was happening in Italy, which could have been more logical because black combat troops were operating there in 1944 .
