Over the past year, Uwe Boll has experienced only marginal improvement as a filmmaker, staging the competent "In the Name of the King" (a clone of "Lord of the Rings") and the proudly vulgar satire post-September 11 "Postal." But then came "Seed", and the counter was reset, keeping his candidacy for legitimacy and respect much further. And I am a fan of the guy, his films present a unique vision of opposite, and are never boring. <br /> <br /> Born of his frustration at the wild warnings his early films received, "Seed" is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary and an even more cruel attempt to create an iconic slasher mythology (Boll often seems take a page from the successful restart of "Halloween" by Rob Zombie). The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), an impetuous bully who killed 666 people and is on death row awaiting execution; after frying the beast without success, he gets up from the grave to take revenge on those who put him there ... and begins a series of completely free chaos. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a new millennium slasher in In The Vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too indefinable and boring to leave an impression, ultimately resembling a delirious professional wrestler doing " The Murders Toolbox "on a succession of equally boring victims. Moreover, Seed's character and Boll's "message" are contrary: the death penalty is wrong, of course, but do we really expect sympathy for a soulless killer who left a hundred corpses in his wake? ? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts as an apathetic and long lost brother to James Remar in "Dexter": a policeman who often sits at his desk, flipping through newspaper clippings, and watch useless stop-motion scenes of rotting animals and people trapped in Seed's lair. At the moment when he and a group of cardboard policemen are storming Seed's hideout, the sequence is so long, so poorly designed (lighting is almost non-existent), and not very exciting (despite a good dose of gore) that she almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> The poor quality of the film is not limited to this sequence: "Seed" seems to have been shot by a drunk filmmaker, because the camera drinks and weaves itself to infinity, a technique more stomach that turns that the gore itself; these prolonged taps of very few events only draw attention to the sinuous, almost non-existent narrative. At 90 minutes, the film is sufficiently distended to be considered a form of torture, which could have been Boll's intent from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I guess the joke is on me.
