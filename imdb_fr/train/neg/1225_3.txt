Well, let me start by saying how HILAIRE this film is, I just could not help laughing at the sheer stupidity of it. Do not get me wrong, he's particularly well done by Bassinger, but the script is right, and the mind is completely mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> The principle is good and until Della really witnesses the murder that she commits after that, it just goes down. In the middle of the film, the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and, of course, instead of lobing it at the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, a jack and finally a flare (as in a boat in distress) . <br /> <br /> Then, there is the last line that I promise you. If he has not sewn you, I will eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to those who just want to laugh at some good old scary movies. May I also suggest you pay attention to the scene in the break with the guy who falls from the wooden board a meter high, it takes me every time.
