Despite what many people thought of the first movie, I really liked it. This one though. How to summarize in one word ?: This film is (and here is the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it part by part: Here is the plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has problems of another kind: the Court -Jester, father of his son, went astray, while the super Spliss went to the extreme to fight his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for blond and full hair. In her desperation, Snow White asks for the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find her six other fellow dwarves, then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over a weekend, where the screenwriters were very drunk but just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are good jokes. Even for the fans of the first part, or for the fans of other actors, the purchase of the DVD is not really worth it. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that, at least, saves the movie from total oblivion, is the performance of some actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Unfortunately, the scenario is so bad that neither the actors nor all of them can compensate for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point, they cross each other even in our reality, and unfortunately .. they do not do anything funny while being here. <br /> <br /> Yet many great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (particularly funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but unfortunately all these comedians are not able to give life to this very bad scenario. <br /> <br /> This may be a treat for some hardcore fans, but for regular moviegoers or now DVD rental companies or buyers, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I regret even to rent the movie.
