this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a movie with 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> His characters are only a collection of characters with tragic or comic clich√©s, the total of which is a neurotic dialogue as only Woody Allen could write. Women love this because it's as if they are looking in the mirror to be able to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> but I did not like this film because there was no car chase and the movie was not quarreling either. there were no drug lords or gangsters either. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie did not have any snakes. This is not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether so think about what I said before you end up watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you look like a woman who has weight problems, men's problems enjoy sex and the city and mcbeal ally so that is meaningful to you.
