The above seemed to be a much more appropriate title when my suicidal submarines and I decided to look at this masterpiece of modern bullshit. <br /> <br /> Erotic, Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, here are all the things that this movie can not be. <br /> <br /> But it's incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and the bad dubbing add to that to make one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet, this film does not even try to be funny, it is one of the great achievements of the film, it becomes a comedy without even trying to distract it. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an old man who looks strangely like Santa Claus devours the zombies and crushes the vampires. It made me forget to believe in the title of the film. If they were vampires against zombies, why did not vampires and zombies fight? Oh well, no matter, in addition, there were more defects in this rental than in the title. Like this one; there has been a virus that has swept across America creating zombies resembling beings acting a bit like the average tourist. And yet, there are only four zombies in the entire movie. Another problem is that a shop everywhere is deserted. You would surely see a little zombies wandering in the woods or in the background. In fact, I think they wandered around a forest circle all the time, because they did not have enough money to film in a larger place, that the director does not want to waste his precious time filming so much. different. areas of wood where he was too busy with a trailer to bother to deal with such trivial things. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing this that he did not have time to hire a big cast or even a publisher. And so he asked the eight cast members to dress in different people and try not to be noticed, whereas I suppose he changed his name and started hissing at random on the film reels. The only reason this "movie" found its place in our bag is because we confused it with Freddy vs. Jason. And the only way out was to put gas masks on and fix them to our skull to avoid the stench of this nauseating. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, we laughed at the end, but I "I'm sure we do it often when he has lost his sanity ............. ......
