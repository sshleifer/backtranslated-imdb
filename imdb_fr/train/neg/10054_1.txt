I'm not the only one to admire Superman's first film, a film brilliantly shot by Richard Donner. I'm not the only one to despise Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to Richard Donner's cut of the same movie. Unfortunately, this remains an absolute abomination. disbelief is needed in large doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a freshman. In a sense, there is no plot because the characters have no motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without its powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this movie ... maybe the slapstick of the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic scenario on which this movie is based. Super-duper bad.
