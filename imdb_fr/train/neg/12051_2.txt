This film is "fascinating" but, in the same way, a car accident is attractive. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experience - and a frivolous and biased experience. Filmmakers are manipulative and do not seem to have a problem getting the lowest possible denominator. The way the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening stages at which filmmakers force Ted's participation (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any real attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posterior and further exploit Ted's situation. The worst is that filmmakers stop following Ted after six months; and apparently are completely cut off from the subject they had followed so close to months before. If they cared, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they would have had to let him spend that money without any intervention. This film is at best a jackass cascade at shoulder height and not a documentary. It is sad to think that $ 100,000 could have changed the life of a homeless person if it had been put in good hands.
