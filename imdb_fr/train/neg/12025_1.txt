This film was on the Romance channel, and I thought it would be a wacky 80's movie that would be nice on a certain level, so my brother and I watched it. My boy was bad. The boy has a crush on the girl - the correction, his daughter * dream * (apparently, there is a difference, and I'm surprised that he realized that she was his dream girl - he had fallen in love from her to more than 10 meters away, I guess that's just going to show the power of dream girls), the boy ends up pretending to be a woman to look like a dream girl (creative in the sense where it is a distant plan, but not creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one could imagine), delicate situations ensue, a match is made (all this apparently takes place towards the end in the afternoon - either the place was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the actors had to wait until they came out of their daily jobs to come on the set, I suspect the latter). Very clumsily done, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * accidentally *, so there's really nothing to buy it back. Unless you want to see the debut of Chad Lowe, before he finally gets his piece of the pie with his role as an HIV-positive gay guy from the "Life Goes On" series, or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably had to watch Dennis Franz's buttocks). But these are unlikely reasons - I would say that a "systematic disturbance of the senses" would be a more justified objective. I am surprised to have watched everything. I guess that's the kind of thing where, halfway through, you end up * still * watching because of a morbid, self-flagellist inner problem, and think you might as well finish it off so that you can tell your friends and family that I've been sitting in such a horrible film, hoping it will bring you sympathy for the dubious state of your mental health. Can you * take up the challenge?
