Rajinikanth is reborn after gaining magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> The film poses several obvious problems for the occasional audience: Rajinikanth is always at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door thinks she is an irresistible "boy" ("vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst of which is to see how today's women derive their exercise from housework - but we must believe that he is not a theist; even if he was well read, he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can continue, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are god-men, there are gods and there is Rajinikanth. The repertoire is struggling to tidy up Rajinikanth in one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth only makes Rajinikanth do what the Tamil heroes do: stand up to the bad guys and, although he is the eldest, be wooed by the prettiest girl in the movie. Rajinikanth does it well and some of Rajinikanth's brand styles are really nice - "Baba count" is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that these initial few minutes are just the preface to a worst book ever to be written. Even this preface is punctuated by forced and obvious comedies. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero faces several obstacles (from the politicians, as usual), but we can not really take on the hero because we do not know what his ultimate goal is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another of his sermons and goes off to become a hermit. The director offers no solution to the problem of the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Either he shows shine spots, or he does not bother to invest himself fully in this film - who can blame him. There is a scene where Rajinikanth gets into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and throws the baba account. The music is very apt at the moment and acts as a catalyst adding extra tension. The songs are all mediocre, nobody would care about the songs of this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb. This film has all the elements that justify its legitimate place at the bottom of the IMDb ranking.
