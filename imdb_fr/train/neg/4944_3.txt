So, why is this show nil? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that it is. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the premises of the series, the Caveman series, doomed to extinction, focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern America and is based on characters featured in a series of TV commercials for Geico Insurance. The concept is sound and there is every reason to believe that it could be executed successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a moment, but then the advertising slogan - something to the effect of "We I'm not so different from you" gave me the key the sucking of the show. Although the cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species of humanity, it seems that the main characters of this show are exactly the same as those of us who are boring. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was my past a video game writer - rather than a California writer without a committee or committee, based on committees - but this show had such potential, and nothing all this has not been achieved. For starters, producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us. <br /> <br /> It could be fun, for example, to give them jobs such as trainee and furniture storekeeper, when they would have been more convincingly attracted to things like underground utility workers. and guides in cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games like squash, when we could spend a whole episode trying to get permits to hunt after a game with spears? A show like this could write itself, and it takes some deliberately bad writing to make it so bad and boring. <br /> <br /> Another boring aspect of this show is an attempt to portray cavemen as subject to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawning! This has been done so many times before, and never more dull than that. And, as stated before, Neanderthals are really a different species. Therefore, using them as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is both unconvincing and unexpected. <br /> <br /> Feedback is welcome, including those who want me why I'm wrong. I would like to enjoy this show and I am sorry I can not have it so far. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
