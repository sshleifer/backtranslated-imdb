Any movie whose title is as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically grab the attention of any bad movie fan, but the plot is a lot different from what you'd expect after watching the DVD cover. The Bagman is not a good movie. It falls into the category of movies that appear to have been (and probably have been) filmed with a home video camera. The game is terrible. I have not heard and seen such a game of wood since Troll 2. There are many scenes of nudity and sex, but they are clearly too quickly sifted. The characters are stupid and quite forgettable. The end (which I will not spoil) can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene. Because of the film's nondescript nature, nothing beyond awful production values ​​is really scary (terrible attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly still, etc.). Recommended for fans of bad film only.
