It's a film that shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer attends many beautiful scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties - I particularly liked seeing the tramway approaching the tunnel and the tram that climbs the hillside - but in a sense, this beautiful cinematography is self-destructive, because it creates an atmosphere that "something will happen" - and nothing happens. The script also continues to pretend to a plot or an action or trauma - and does not always succeed. Not even delivering the theme (I guess) of the film, the essential essential characters. The main actors, too pretty at the same time for their roles, did not transmit any repression or agony, and the scenario did not expose us any of them. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is an other story. His character was so well fashioned, so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him.
