... so I thought about adding a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend two hours if you want to see it in all its states. It is obvious that he has filled up for this role and that he looks devilishly good in them - or less. There is a long sequence in a cave where he has to undress. There is a good time when he has to pursue Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands in section on his groin. William McNamara is naturally a bit skinny, but he has a nice and generous handful of loot. In addition, it rises at a time when, if you interrupt the action at the right time, you can see all the enchilada. If you are inclined to do it, go for it, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about the men of the navy during a "road trip" are. I would just like to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity, free nudity. William McNamara can he act? Damn if I know.
