After reading several good reviews and hearing beautiful things about it orally, I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say that I was rather disappointed. The story was difficult to follow because the film unfolds like a series of very poorly executed flashbacks between the present and the recent past. The characters, despite the efforts of the actors, are flat and uninteresting. Sex is and nudity are more explicit than necessary. I have never seen a movie where they seemed so useless to the plot. The end is very anti-climate and leaves many unanswered questions in a story that was not well explained to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
