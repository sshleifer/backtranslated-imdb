What do we know we know is a mistaken and random look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who furrow and pontificate in a totally unscientific way. Their interviews are cut into extremely small segments and scattered in a few tiny CGI and flashy intrigues. <br /> <br /> The film addresses themes from science, philosophy, theology and politics, without any concern for precision. , and in a way extracts some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult question to answer that filmmakers would like to point out. <br /> <br /> It's a glaring and logical mistake. non-sequential. How did we start quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my mind". <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this film, and almost nothing precise. Any discerning viewer will be annoyed by heavy editing, intrusive and unnecessary special effects and a general lack of substance. The discerning viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and all the other topics covered in this film.
