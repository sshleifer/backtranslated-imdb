I disagree with many of the things that have been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the new German wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are major flaws in a simple exhibition, in the basic communication of the critical points of the plot concerning the abortion of Maria and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers realized that the husband had agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to his wife and recover her until Oswald's death? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is very unsatisfactory because arbitrary and accidental. The original script called Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, after learning that her husband had actually sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only pours water from a tap on her wrist as a sign of suicide. Maria is summarily exploded, rather than having to face the consequences of her self-deception and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public to the private, the political to the staff. Contrary to what critics and "experts" claim, I do not think it works. The simple fact of introducing radio historical information or the sound of the hammers of the German reconstruction into the soundtrack of the movie's dramatic events does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> Maria's selfish ambition of moving from poverty to prosperity parallels the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Maria is therefore destined to be a specific woman and reflecting her time and place, but is actually non-original and non-specific. Women claim their independence by using sex for their own progress for ages. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several cases of inexcusable neglect and amateurism - Fassbinder's drug addiction and his resulting impatience and inattention. Strangers speak off-screen without ever being seen; music is awkwardly intrusive in places; and the melodramatic posture sporadically replaces the game. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, for a film condemning a country to voluntary collective amnesia of the Holocaust, it never mentions it once.
