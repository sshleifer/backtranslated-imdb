Well, I'd be lying if I said it could easily compete with Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still, it was more appealing to me for its moral value. I bought the VHS for the first time when my son was about 2 years old and she immediately became her favorite. My wife and I have been staunch supporters of Robert Townsend since using credit cards to finance his first film, "Hollywood Shuffle." While he needs to leverage the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable, his films are always fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero a contemporary urban style. I always thought that if there were superheroes, they would not provide the same scenarios as those described in the comics. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: car robbery, bad neighborhood, gangs of local drug traffickers using children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission has remained virtually unchanged in the community. <br /> <br /> What I have Apart from James Earl Jones's "Young Forever" show, the neighborhood's reaction to its recently discovered powers has been deemed truly entertaining. It was not long before they had a full agenda, without his contribution, of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend it to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, the acting was bad and the continuity was rotten, but it ranks first with my children. Robert Townsend is working to bring home movies, so to speak. I doubt he's ever really recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he is, but there will be, and there will always be, those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One point to consider. the film, which I find amusing: During the whole battle with Simon, nobody bothered to call the police ???? What father and mother do you know who will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there, rubbing on my side, foot to foot. Dad would load his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Praise him and check him out. It's worth it to see at least once and it's good for those of you who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Congratulations to Robert cameos!
