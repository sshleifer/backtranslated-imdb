The reason why the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is that no one can get their hands on a color copy of this public domain film, at best a modest sea story. <br /> <br /> Distributed for TV by Allied The artists, DVDs (or VHS) currently on the market for this title all come from the same 16MM TV stand. Films distributed on television before 1963 were often distributed in black-and-white copies, as the majority of viewers did not have color schemes anyway. The striking black-and-white prints for television were also cheaper, as they often involved multiple copies to cover all the stations broadcasting a contracted film.
