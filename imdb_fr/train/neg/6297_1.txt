I am a big fan of Martin Amis, on whose book this movie is based. Unfortunately, the director was not able to translate the book on screen. The novel is completely postmodern and very artificial in its excessively overworked characters and in the disintegration of the line of intrigue and development of traditional characters. This is a hilarious examination of greed, excesses and emptiness on the part of one of the most moral British writers of the time. The director of the film completely missed the novel. In his hands, the film screams at a vertiginous speed, indulging in all known trick shots and at a "strange" camera angle possible. It's like Ken Russel under acid, and he suffers from the indulgence of this old director up to a hundred. Even the (brief) preview of the beautiful penis of actor Christian Solimeno was not enough to save this miserable movie for me. Terrible!
