Visually beautiful? Certainly. I have seen few films so beautiful for a while. Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow use striking cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar and yet something quite new. The period seems to be that of the 1930s or early 40s. The film tells the recent attacks on the city of New York by mechanized armies flying generators and the like for an inexplicable reason. In addition, the mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, do not believe in yourself, it's Captain Sky himself, with his sneaky journalist girlfriend, always exciting, and behind the scenes, his trusty, very competent sidekick. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and graphics is devoid of storytelling and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. That being said, the film aims to create a series of soap operas of yesteryear. They had pretty distant stories and bad actors - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and big names of this movie. One would think that two award-winning artists at the academy and Jude Law could keep a movie afloat, but Sky Captain sinks miserably. Despite its fantastic darkness, I told myself that I wanted the film to end and that I could continue my life. I was not interested in a story that was of little interest. I did not care at all about glib representations. Paltrow was horrible. Pretty was a joke with a role practically without substance. Law can not be too clear about the one-line tradition on his limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's neither Will Smith, nor Mel Gibson, nor even Wesley Snipes. The saddest thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, is that this promise was so promising and yet so little materialized. The movie bored me ten minutes later - I was waiting for something to interest me - and it never happened.
