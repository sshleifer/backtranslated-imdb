It's a very bad movie. I racked my brains and I can not comment positively. The acting is atrocious. I saw more credible performance on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president, and a shark attacking everything close to it should have been fun. The night of the sharks is not even so bad that it's good. The dialogue rings and is delivered as if it were written a few seconds before it was shot. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised my ears did not start bleeding techno sounds of the 80s that someone was bothering to record. <br /> <br /> From all I read, the Italian film industry was dead in 1987. Night of the sharks is like a last nail in the coffin.
