I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to make a serious horror or even an action movie when they did Carnosaur 3. The movie is completely ridiculous from beginning to end. Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Certainly a warning brand in the genre 'So Bad It's Good'. If you like the worst of the worst, it's for you.
