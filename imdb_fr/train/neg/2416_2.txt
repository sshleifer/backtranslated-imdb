2 stars and I am generous. Look, it's a low-budget zombie movie set in Oakland, a gang. As the plot progresses, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed at the wheel. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film: what zombies ?! All the "zombies" just growl (which does not even sound scary) and let out a false red blood from their mouths! No frightening eyes, no decaying flesh, just a group of people who grumble pathetically and run like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only 6 zombies in the movie. So it's not as if the whole "hood" was rife with zombies or other activities, it's just a few and is contained in no time. <br /> <br /> The acting game is so bad it's hilarious. Nobody can play at all in this film (except perhaps a gang member) and it really seems like a group of friends have come together, decided to start their family and made a movie on a weekend. <br /> <br /> Final Note: Since when do doctors wear tracksuits ?! Skip this one, please!
