While there are many familiar "TV" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge," there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or the performances. In fact, the only thing that sets it apart from a 1960-1970 television series like "The Rat Patrol" is a larger cast and a lot more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break with all the light comedy stuff he had done ("Maverick", "Support your local sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc.). ). Unfortunately, his earthly sympathy frustrates him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to take advantage of the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western character. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I guess "A Man Called Sledge" could be classified in the spaghetti westerns category, although the stimulation is too slow to really match this subgenre. Fans of the slow-motion television series "Combat" will feel an instant connection while Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Frank Kowalski. Add some sluggish and fashionable shots that fade into the fashion sense that draw attention to themselves instead of being used for narration purposes. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard of the "big holdup" (insert "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge showing how to break a $ 300,000 gold expedition. His band includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that during the movement, the shipment is guarded by 40 agents and is locked in a safe inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same scenario. <br /> <br /> The story would make a decent hour of television but would age very quickly as a feature film very padded. Garner does not let any of his charm mingle with his description and the film does not generate enough suspense to retain the interest of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The thing ends up breaking and burning shortly after the robbery when the gang engages. an artificial and totally illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
