It's a bad movie. Not a bad guy either. This is a bad ugly. It was painful to watch. The management was awful, with lots of jumps and the green and yellow hues used throughout the film give the characters a sickly look. Keira Knightly was not convincing at all, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke committed themselves to this criminal celluloid waste. The scenario was terrible and the acting was like nails on a blackboard. If you have not seen it, do not do it. You will not lose anything and you will only lose two hours of your life watching this movie. I have already seen bad movies and even liked them because of their flaws. This one is just a waste of time.
