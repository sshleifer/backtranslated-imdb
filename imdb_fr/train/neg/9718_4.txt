An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) is having a party with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She notices a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked outside, but she can not call the police because it would hurt her marriage to Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). Then Guttenberg, an honest citizen, discovers that another woman was attacked and murdered in the neighborhood barely half an hour later. He introduces himself and claims to have witnessed the first attack, for the sole purpose of transmitting to him the information provided by Huppert. Well, never bear false witness against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch a murderer has been quickly twisted. When he meets the first victim, McGovern, she reacts immediately to what has happened, but agrees to remain silent for the moment. But then, Guttenberg is in court, supposed to identify the heavy (Greenquist) and we discover in cross-examination that he is low visibility and can not identify objects at a distance, not to mention the faces. (That's not important, because after all, he's never seen creep.) The plot is almost labyrinthine. Guttenberg also denounces the main suspect when Huppert is murdered. <br /> <br /> He narrowly escapes arrest and masquerades as the now-friendly McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern develop a plan to trap the murderer. It will serve as bait. They will follow the flagrant wave in one of his sneaky places and McGovern will act like the doxy who attracts the murderer, just to convince him to try to kill her. But all will be well, you see, because not only will Guttenberg closely monitor her, but not only will he alert the police a few minutes after entering this dive, but she will also keep a tin can of mace - just inside. . <br /> <br /> I ask you, the alert viewer, is this scenario going as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has an extremely interesting bone structure. She seems every mandible and little mouth sometimes, but she is dynamic. Steve Guttenberg has hair in his hair and that's about it. Otherwise, he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can play, it is not obvious in this film. The killer is so trained and neat that he seems to be wearing one of these deformation masks in this episode of Twilight Zone on greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Did the director, Curtis Hanson, not continue "LA Confidential"? It was a job well done. Here, everything seems clumsy and artificial, even small rooms. Just before the inevitable climax of violence, a uniformed police officer is presented to delay McGovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a role as a late consumer. He is a neat guy and always reliable. Paul Shenar as a cuckold husband has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he also does a great job. <br /> <br /> This shady joint where McGovern catches the attention of the murderer, where she plays billiards with a few hairy monkeys were shot in a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from my home . The way the interior is laid out, it is clear that this dive is supposed to be dangerous and dirty. In fact, it seems a little more elegant on the screen than in reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is Hitchcock territory and it makes people cry what he would have done in this story.
