This film is awful. The CGI is the very cheap CGI gray blob. The crocodile looks like a big gray burr. The worst is that no effort is made to make it work or give it the impression of living. This is primarily a CGI image purchased with photos that is placed in scenes and is almost expected to see the hand moving the CGI image smudge on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of really bad movies from the Sci-Fi channel. <br /> <br /> Besides the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of typical low cost actors who probably work as waiters / waitresses in local dinners while they wait for their big breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the villains tries to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps out of the water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and across the balcony and shoot the bad Kate and instead of collapsing directly into the building (and crushing Kate), the Croc simply flies backwards at the same angle into the water. No law of physics can apply to this film or special effects. At least there is honor among crocodiles.
