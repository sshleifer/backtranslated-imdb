Gwoemul (the host) - Due to the pollution of the Han River, a mutant beast embarks on the rampage. The youngest member of the Park family is caught by the beast. It is up to the rest of the family to find her before she becomes the last meal of the beast. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: Mutant Bears, Oversized Alligators, Voracious Komodo Dragon Packs, all. Creatures are my favorite kind of horror movie. So, I really wanted to love the host, but that was not the case. <br /> <br /> He had three major problems: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen by taking a look at his IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Science Fiction / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many kinds cursed. It was taken too seriously to become a comedy and yet, the heart was too light to be able to convey a real message (even if it seemed to attempt to make a statement Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confused hodgepodge with all other styles. <br /> <br /> Second, after the first monster attack, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family goes astray in search of one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America apparently do nothing. And that's it, they walk around, beating themselves from time to time, probably for a bit of comedy. This lack of action has meant that my attention has deviated and apparently has done the same for the director, while the whole thread of the plot was not resolved (a mysterious plague invented by the devilish Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). <br /> Finally, the film is awkwardly political. This portrays Americans as being stupid and evil, but gives no American characters with more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene presents the most obvious moment between America and the silly Korean. With a Korean assistant from the morgue asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American coroner almost cracks maniacally as he orders the assistant to continue. In addition to being racist, it's a lazy movie and there's no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some motion effects are pretty cool, and the initial monster hunt through the park is very fun. There are also some nice pictures in the movie. Some remind me strangely of how Firefly was filmed (simmering cameras, fuzzy shots, etc.). There is also a beautiful scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he saved are sitting in the mobile food stand family. It's dark and the snow is falling, the lamppost emits a cold light, but the food stand gives off a warm glow. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a decent creature movie, and instead, I get some pseudo-politics, a horror comedy. Looking at the comments on IMDb, I can not help but think that if it had been an American production, it would have been planned. It's not because it's a foreign film that it's good. There have been some great movies in Korea in recent years (The Trilogy of Revenge and Brotherhood, for example), but it's certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once, I'm in favor of a remake. Reinforce the staging, improve the script and it could have been a beautiful film. As things stand, it's not worth spending time with anyone.
