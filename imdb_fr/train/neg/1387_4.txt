It's hard to believe that a Jet Li movie full of "action" could be so boring, but it was a transcendental trash. The plot is an amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky movies. The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a cartoon story about a group of superhuman soldiers who have to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who keeps an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life of pacifist librarian. The rescued killers resurface with a quality Austin Powers conspiracy to conquer the world, and Li abandons his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed, which probably accentuated the 25-point and 25-point special plot of 25-cent special effects. But I suspect that even the 8-year-old Ninja Turtle Watchers would have found this place juvenile and hollow.
