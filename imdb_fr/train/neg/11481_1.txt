If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they have other actors instead of people going to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist cast the wise old sage figure on the ground when he was never in danger? This forced the old man to hide his wound for pride and the young man would feel guilty, leaving him with a disability for life. I guess that's why the main character refuses money and the old man works like a dog, even if he volunteers for extra work. If D-Bag's boyfriend is a bad guy because he's a long-distance boyfriend, why is a soldier better? He has good reason to be jealous, to move him away from his hometown and to become a protective and controlling manipulative father. All the supposedly friendly characters are not and everyone is the "bad" boyfriend. How did they meet, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
