A fashion designer stumbles over a cat and falls into a pool, hitting her head against something floating on the surface. With rather tacky effects (it was a TV movie), she floats out of her body. She floats in a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke and black and rigid figures fall into her sight (they look like the models of her apartment). I almost thought I was watching a film by Jess Franco ... As her friends raised her up, a black arm grabbed her by the wrist and she had to struggle to break free. When she is well, she remembers everything and has an ugly bruise on her forearm. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, she is almost hit by an uncontrollable car that arrives on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico on vacation. When she gets there, she is surprised to find that it's the day of the dead. They are bored by another American tourist who keeps following them and almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have had near death experience. They all experimented with the tunnel, but not the black characters or the almost repeated escapes of death. One of them has, and he is very worried. She is also encouraged to meet a psychic. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells him about people he calls "Walkers" (the name of the novel on which it is based). These are people who would have died from a cause that, when examined, is dead from another cause. So it's as if they continued walking after their death until their death, but he attributes this to poor record keeping. <br /> <br /> I watched this 102-minute video, and it was terribly long. I can not imagine that there is a 192-minute version! Maybe if it were supposed to be watched over two nights on TV, it would be better to watch it that way than in one sitting. <br /> <br /> I only read a novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if is representative of his work, he is not the most original of writers. Floater had the following common plot: taken from a child kills people out of revenge. Even the variation was quite common: taken from a child dies and kills people years later, to take revenge on beyond the grave. And in fact, he has something in common with this film, in that the kid practices astral projection and when he is drowned, he comes out of his body like this. I do not know how far From the Dead of Night follows his novel Walkers. I understand that screaming movies do not look much like his novels. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty slow movie, and the special effects and cinematography are really embarrassed by the low budget (and presumably), and are made for. -The shortcomings of television. There are many actors of easily recognizable characters. It also seems very dated, more from the beginning to the mid-1980s than in 1989. I found it boring. Sole Survivor (1983) (undoubtedly the inspiration for the films of Final Destination of the 2000s) is a much better low-budget film covering a similar subject. He blows From the death of the night.
