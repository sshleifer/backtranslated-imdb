BTK Killer, Green River Killer and Zodiac Killer; The man keeps on throwing absolute garbage and, ironically, he loves his bullshit. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a film by Ulli Lommel, but I was so surprised to see how much everyone finds his works terrible. As the movies I said at the beginning are not even equal to six when they are added together! After reading the reviews, I was curious to see how bad this guy was. He is the worst. <br /> <br /> The credits do not end with the beginning of the pathetic movie and I soon realized that the sound was incredibly badly doubled. The acting was incredibly horrible and identical to the camera. . Editing is easily the worst. This film had no meaning and I could not bear it unbearably because it would not end and I only had 45 minutes in the film. I could not any more. I lost 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS BAVAGE!
