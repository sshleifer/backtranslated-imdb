WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop". If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think Annie Hall was a fluke. <br /> <br /> This gives a star because you see Hugh Jackman's naked torso. This is the only thing that "Scoop" has to do. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogyny, and his fixation on women young enough to become his granddaughter, paralyzed his ability to make films The plot looks promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, asks Scarlett Johansson, a student with a fluffy head, investigates whether an English lord, Hugh Jackman, is or is not the famous Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes. A wizard, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising plot, the film lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. It's an amateurish and incredibly successful effort for someone who has already shot a film before, not to mention the dozens. Maybe Allen had a stroke that was not reported in the press. <br /> <br /> It says a lot about the fact that unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now in his seventies, has finally allowed a young man to get the girl back. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed so that the girl does not win anyone. <br /> <br /> There is an old scene where Johansson, for no reason essential to the film, allows himself to get drunk, seduced by a powerful and elderly director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what is happening. It's a "slam, bam, I have to go" kind of moment. This has nothing to do with the plot, and it belies Johansson in the eyes of the viewer. Why did Allen add this useless scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - sleeping with the female principal. Allen takes his cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not an actress yet. She does not know how to control the screen except by wearing a fitted top and cleavage. She imitates Allen in a few scenes and it just looks weird and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that her character is written like a doll that can not work without a ghost or a senior and less than an impressive magician, telling her what to do at every turn. <br /> <br /> She's about half the age of Jackman and she appears as a very tasteless screen presence in their scenes together. <br /> <br /> Public members who are not obsessed with breasts deserve better than their heroines, and Jackman, too - a scenario that gives the heroine intelligence and agency, and an actress who can convey these qualities. <br /> <Hugh Jackman is also deceived by the script. Apparently, Allen can not stand that Jackman is incredibly handsome and young, so he does not give anything to Jackman. Like Johansson, it is only used for its beauty. It's a shame because, as Jackman has shown in many productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he CAN act. <br /> <br /> Here's the big rebound of the plot - Jackman, suave, lovely English Lord, is really a killer. So, although the movie says it's about letting someone else, other than Allen, go get the girl, she can not have anyone. Jackman, the man to whom she makes love, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Well, Woody. A good way to punish your heroine beyond your reach. <br /> <br /> In an aggressive and passive way, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, thus killing his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson alone at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> One final word: during my screening, no member of the audience laughed at any point in the film. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
