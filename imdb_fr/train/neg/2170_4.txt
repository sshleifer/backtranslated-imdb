This film crosses the border between satire and foolishness. Although a ruleless bridge system can promote marital harmony, it certainly can not promote a winning bridge. Satire did not work for me. But there were a few things that I found nice, especially with the great bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like a championship boxing match. Not only is the competition arena encircled in a box, like a boxing ring, but a referee stands between competitors and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers uninterrupted discussions about the events. At one point, he even listed "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if an offer of four diamonds was a stunning event. And people were glued to their radios for all this, a common event for championship boxing matches. This parody worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy necessary to maintain the desired satire. Paul Lukas does not have much talent for comedy and is misunderstood; the charming Loretta Young and the usual comedian Frank McHugh were not treated well enough; Glenda Farrell has a pretty cartoon as a forgetful blonde at the beginning of the movie, but she almost disappears thereafter. What a waste of talent!
