... said a couple coming out of the cinema just as I was coming in to watch that. Hmm, that's not a good sign, but who knows? Different shots for different people, after all. Well no. They were nice. Godard has published a passionate work (The contempt), entertaining (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (My life to live). This is just a dull intellectual, who annoys the nerves rather quickly. During my screening, literally half of the viewers were out at the end of the film. If only I had been so wise.
