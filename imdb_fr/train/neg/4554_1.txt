Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely has the screen been stained with such a mixture of half-cooked conspiracy theories, puritan pruderies and new-age mumbo jumbo. Most of the story takes place in Viciente, a seaside resort of Cristian located in the Peruvian jungle. Think Tolkien's Rivendell meets Star Trek's Baku planet, inhabited by adept followers of a not-so-mysterious but surprisingly narrow cult of love and peace. Thanks to a dreadful scenography and a delirious scenography (the visualization in the colors of the rainbow of the mysterious "energy" all-healer is particularly hideous), "The Celestine Prophecies" looks like an episode of the 1980s "Twilight Zone". Factual errors concerning church history and nomenclature abound. I can not believe that Hector Elizondo has agreed to be part of that. Maybe it was done without his consent, at Bowfinger. May the Lord have pity on the director, the scriptwriter, the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the film or read the book.
