I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her acting skills. So I found it strange that it appeared in a film that distorted the facts so much. The rescue of his character from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company in Edmonton, Alberta, flying a Twin Otter aircraft designed and built in Canada. The US Air Force, the Navy and the Coast Guard refused the trip, which was beyond their reach. The same company organized a similar rescue a few years later to rescue a man from the base of the South Pole. I think the film faithfully represents a very captivating subject and documents a very brave woman facing a scary task. I do not see why the producers would find it necessary to ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and to show the rescue plane as a Hercules from the US Air Force.
