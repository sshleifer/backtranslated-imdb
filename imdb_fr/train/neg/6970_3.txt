Now, it would be a kind of clich√© if I started talking about the title, so I'll wait. First of all, this film made me wonder why children do stupid things, like wandering in laboratories and breaking bottles. Then I realized that it was a film with a message, that the message was beating the children and that such things would not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster that grows up and causes a little chaos before dying in the typical way of "killing the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... is not blue or simian of any kind. Now, he's craving like I'm being cheated or anything. On the cover, a giant insect / crab / idiot / something on the front was chasing delirious nurses. It happened a bit but I wanted monkeys! just after enjoying MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights ago (half drunk on the brandy of Cask and Creame, it made me think), I was in the mood for more diversions in the way of the 80s. Not so much. If you like snowboarding or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like insects and good reasons to hit children, rent this.
