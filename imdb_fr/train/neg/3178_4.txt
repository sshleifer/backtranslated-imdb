With movies like this, you know you're going to have the usual jokes about ghosts. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors are also doing a good job. It's the direction and the story that is missing. It could have been forgotten if the jokes worked better. The problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course, I laughed a few times. Apart from the talking parrot, there was not an ounce of creativity to notice in the movie. I blame the director for not using the premise to its full potential. Eva certainly has the comic skill to show more but did not have the opportunity to do it. Overall, this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that, it can be completely ignored.
