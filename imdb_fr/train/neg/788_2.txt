A movie with very little positive things to say. <br /> <br /> First of all, he has no rhythm and lacks dramatically in any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being remarkably slow, The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same footage again and again. I lost count of the number of times I saw "this" field at night or that piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> This also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the public does not know what is happening will be grasped rather than simply confused. So without any sign of trouble, we suddenly find that marriage is not what it seems to be despite the impression that everything is fine. We find that Jacob is perhaps the worst peasant in the universe since he seems not to spend time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a useless acre. Beth has the key to a book warehouse? There are countless other issues, some of which are resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And about the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are not scary in themselves ?? and also if they are supposed to have an acreage of an acre, do it as well. <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing lack of reason from Beth (the best performer in the play, followed by Jefferson: the cop) suddenly seems to be blamed for everything under the sun just because she takes "medicines". <br /> <br /> With the full ten minutes to run around the fields in search of the missing child (did he crawl the window? He has six months) the film goes down in the badly written scene after the badly written scene. The "horror" music of bad plinky does not create atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is simply bad.
