Another comment said that the movie is not so bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies the molestation of children. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in, give her 5 stars out of 10. Why not 10? Because the filmography was "scary", the child's shocked looks were "unrealistic" and the big friend was "irritating". Nowhere in criticism does the critic express the indignation that an American film of 1981 presents scenes of a child having sex with an adult woman. I happened to see this movie smoking during a stay in a hotel with Showtime. For me, even if the big friend had acted like a storm and deserved an Oscar, I would still have to give the film a single star. Howard Hessman of this television played in the film at the same time that he appeared in WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But do not believe me on my word!
