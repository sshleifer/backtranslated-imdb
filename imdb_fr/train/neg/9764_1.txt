In a word ... abominable. I give her a star for hippie sex scenes and women who love the eyes, if not, forget that. The worst effort of Corman, without exception. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently scratched from the cast. I can not believe that it will now be on DVD (from 15/02/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer me up, I swept the digital channels ... the place seemed pretty interesting because I like watching fiction films, hippie culture and rebellious teen movies. It sounded familiar and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to the day. <br /> <br /> Only after watching it, I now know why this familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered seeing this film at the age of 14 (in the early seventies) at Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even moaned how bad this movie looked. Actor: appalling, history: awful, cinematography: almost awful, music: terrible, sound: horrible, realization: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this film ... you feel "gassed" after watching this putrid movie - or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" room "for wasting your brain. I saw some homemade Super 8 movies that shame this movie. It's definitely a new addition to my all-time movies, Top Ten WORST ... it's up there (bottom) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
