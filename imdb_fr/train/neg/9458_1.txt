There are already a lot of comments that tell exactly how I feel about this movie, so I'll make it short. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" seemed wonderful to me. Jim Carrey is a truly talented physical comedian. to be a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers gets his bursts of laughter while being annoying. I loved him so much in his years "Waynes World" and "So I got married to an ax murderer" - but I never liked Austin Powers and "The Cat In The Hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for kids, not just in adult content, but in the fact that some of them were so dated that they did not entertain anyone for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! It's a shame because the kids were very friendly, just like "Mom". They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have gotten by if it was not for Myers, a disgusting and revolting Cat portrait. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers do it? even a glance at a script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to run it! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and props were wonderful !!! But unfortunately, they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Doctor Seuss, this man was a genius! Do not ruin his reputation by adapting his work so lazy and messy! <br /> <br /> 1/10
