A decent suite, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) assumes new identities in order to make his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. A murder always ruthless, but the film seems very ironic. All humor is not funny. The Total project seems like a quickie, and sometimes Nelson goes way beyond the goals. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen ... it should have happened to this script.
