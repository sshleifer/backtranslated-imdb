Spoiler below, but read on or you'll never know what awful fate awaits anyone thinking of renting "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night, in an isolated research lab, a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results. A chemical compound created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system in the basement of the building. Now, the rodents involved in the upper-floor laboratory experiment are not the only rats in the facility that will become modified species. Professor Schultz, a leading researcher in biology, has recently determined that adding a new enzyme now allows its "hunt and destroy" formulation to regenerate for the time it takes to neutralize deadly cancerous tumors. When three different levels of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest is poured into the defective "Waste Hazard" well, shocking side effects result in a night of terror ..... right ..... <br Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. All this screams "Low-budget!", From the dreadful actor acting to the special effects that are among the worst I have ever seen. The characters are fools of clichÃ©s and act in a stupid and predictable way: walk alone in the dark corridors, look for a cat, stumble and fall so that the "rats" can catch them, embark in a small room, etc. <br /> <br /> While some films are made cheaply, this film really takes the cake. All possible nooks are cut off, from the reuse of previous shots to turning the Lab's halls from different angles to make it bigger (that reminds me: why only TWO guys were working in this gigantic building?!?!? !!!?), music and special effects that could be done on a children's studio PC. <br /> <br /> That brings me to the worst aspect of this pile of smoking manure: the special effects. Just horrible. Computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene, so even the most stupid moviegoers can see that they are computer generated. And this giant rat costume - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! seriously, are we supposed to believe that this baby to panic is a monster? Just pitiful ........ On the bright side, some of the gore seems pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> The actors are all void. person involved in the production did not care or did not know what they were doing. I lost enough time with the reviews, just follow my advice, it's waste. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: the transfer is zero, the sound is passable and there is a commentary track on the disc composed by the director and two of his friends, who say they have absolutely nothing to do with the movie but were there to ask questions and make comments. These three subhuman primordial muds are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can hurt themselves or others. I do not want to waste your time or your time anymore, my readers, because I'm starting to remember more than I want from this movie ..... DVD Rating: 1/10.
