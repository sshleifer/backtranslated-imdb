Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that she is only acting. I like Izzard. The plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connection with the characters, he never knows who to sympathize with, nor even to whom it matters. Slow, dull film, with some laughs, but little and not very funny anyway. The plot is not engaging or suspensive at all. You can see each plot turn a mile and a half. What is this movie supposed to be? The comedy? Drama? We do not care? You will not be here by the end of this movie.
