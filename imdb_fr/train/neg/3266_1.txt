When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has left with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to tell him his story of misfortune - to discover only that Norman has a secret lover : the effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well and many complications ensue - including Ben's attempt to make Norman homosexual by staring at him with a bitch (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description of the film sounds a lot more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... THAT'S WHAT YOU? was an absolute disaster on the New York scene. To give the piece its due, I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theater production - and although no one accused it of being a superficial joke, the cast was playing so broadly and so so dead that it turned out to be pretty fun. It is unfortunate that the distribution of this film did not do the same. <br /> <br /> This is an atrociously played movie. Red Foxx, one of the hilarious comic books of the twentieth century, is about as funny as the wash yesterday, Michael Warren (later appeared in the television series HILL STREET BLUES to much better effect) rivals Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; Truth be told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a Wayland Flowers cameo have a spark - and unfortunately it's only in comparison to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Not only does the poorly executed film look bad. According to the film tradition, this was the first big-screen effort to be videotaped, which was then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me, it shows. The film looks like a bad sitcom from the 1970s to the painted horizon seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become funny, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: miss it. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with a three meter pole. Go back slowly then run like crazy. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
