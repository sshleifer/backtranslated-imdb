This is a direct sequel to "The Mummy's Hand" (1940), because the main character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now 30 years older and tells the story (using archival footage ) to his son's fiancé. . The film has only two unusual aspects: the premature death of Banning and the presence of Turhan Bey. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney, Kharis' mummy, occupies the foreground, though, given the nature of his role, has little more to do than limp along his arms. His presence is not frightening except for his attempt to kidnap Isobel fiancé (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets the second bill, but he is killed in the first fifteen minutes! We would have to wait until 'Psycho' (1960), when a main character (Janet Leigh) dies well before the end of the film! Banning's buddy of the first film, Babe Jenson (now Henson), comes a little later, looking a lot, a lot, older and doing none of the comical things he had done in the original. Hard to believe that it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting job is lost because he is killed by Kharis after only two brief scenes. It was then Banning's son John (played by John Hubbard) to lead the hunt to the cemetery - NO! The sheriff leads a torch brandishing a crowd to Banning to burn and kill the mummy. Sound Universally familiar? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is introduced to the public as the new high priest, Mehmet Bey, to heal and feed the tan leaves to Kharis. With his voice and his appearance "exotic", it's a shame that he is killed so easily. A better movie would have had "Babe" take charge of Von Helsing type by tracking the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead, we have a pedestrian rehearsal of different scenes from previous Universal horror movies, set up by the Griffin Jay hack who wrote many other Universal clunkers, although he also wrote "Don Winslow of the Navy "(1942) and" Don Winslow of the Coastguard "(1943), also featuring Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six films by Joe Palooka (1946) -1949) and, of course, Turhan Bey, with 43 films and TV credits, is great in the title role of "The Amazing Dr. X" (1948). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is much more dark and more atmospheric (with a lot of black shadows in the sheriff's office) mom's first film 'Kharis', but there is little interest and excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm going to him give a 3.
