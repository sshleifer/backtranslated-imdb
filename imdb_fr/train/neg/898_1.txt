Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely rude, rude, rude, and ludicrous. This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling stand-up and trashy. Eddie Murphy favors the value of shock rather than laughter to try to win his sequel. He sometimes manages to be funny, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and unpleasant sexual jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you like Eddie's rude style. I do not think I'm going to bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I much prefer Eddie in a scenario. <br /> <br /> Saturday 17 January 1998 - Video
