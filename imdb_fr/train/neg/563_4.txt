Does any good story have to be "improved" with Broadway's old-fashioned music? Apparently, those who can not invent their own intrigues think that classical literature is only there for looting. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is certainly true that Dickens has often written things that disgust you enormously, and it was a great example of that ... So, of course , take this serious story and add nauseating music and play every character, whether orphan boys or cats, and all that is exhilarating? Argh. Go get me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars of my note come from casting, which I could compare to those of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast of which a game version could be proud, but then they had to go make them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here could do it and they kindly spared Oliver Reed's singing voice (excuse me if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> we said. Why embarrass everyone, if not what is really shameful, by putting idiotic songs into a perfectly successful story? This has rarely been done wisely. Generally, it ruins the story. He did it with this one. The jury still does not know if this story is worth saving, but with everything that knocks it, it's impossible to tell.
