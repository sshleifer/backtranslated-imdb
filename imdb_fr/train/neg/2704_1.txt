I do not understand why people would praise this trash. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, awful and just about everything else. The film is a vision of life, racial problems, prejudices and all that strangely happening in college. This is where it fails. He has no idea of ​​the reality. Among many jarring scenes of the film such as, for example, <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man and arrested by security agents handcuffed and led while the shooter He passes right in front of them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who slaps people on a roof topic who is stopped and beaten by the same black man is then arrested and beaten in the manner of Rodney King while the gunman runs a moment later only one of the four guards pursued him. <br /> <br /> As a previous speaker pointed out, several 230-pound white men were beaten by several black men weighing about 160 lbs, including the 105 lb Bust A Rhymes <br /> <br /> The main characters shallow and uninteresting are another of the shortcomings of the film. Frightened and confused whites and wicked, angry and yet legitimate blacks (?). It's almost like an insult to blacks and whites. I am a white man and I know many black and Hispanic people who agree that this film is wrong to portray characters and attribute them to these characteristics solely because of their race. <br /> <br /> The plot that I will explain now turns. around three characters. A black athlete, the other a frightened and confused white girl who questions her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and frightened, then attributes his problems to blacks in which he becomes a Nazi later in the film. . They all have their share of problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fights, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war and, oh yes, do not forget about education. Which comes back to the end for the fatal shot. After which, they return to their boring lives and think "to be white, it's wrong". Does this look a lot like your college years? I did not mean it. I do not think the director went to college, especially if he was doing terrible things. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a really bad film, very bad and ugly. If you want to see a more specific view or racial problems, go see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of Porkys University Rent. Just avoid this mess.
