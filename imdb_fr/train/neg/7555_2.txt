Do not let the premise fool you, it was a funny movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. History prepares you well for an end that never comes. Even worse, the configuration is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is that it?" I note 2 simply because there were some brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did the best job possible, but he had very few things to work with. There are weird quirks and interesting twists everywhere, which has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one go out on video before wasting your money.
