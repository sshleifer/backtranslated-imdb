I like a lot of actors / actresses involved in this project, so being insulted by the movie was even worse than if they used strangers. The main problem was that this movie was clearly a concept created to please baby boomers. In 20 or 30 years, NBC will probably make a film like this in the early 90's. I can see it now in a black family where children are involved in the riots and the white family in which children rebel and listen grunge rock music. The soundtrack will feature bands such as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, and so on. As it will be just as old as the 60s and I guarantee you that NBC will do it. See the biggest problem with vintage pieces when you're done buying networks is that when you live at a certain period, you do not think I live the 60s or any decade is retro to the fashion at the time. The next time someone does something like that, he should put more weight into his project
