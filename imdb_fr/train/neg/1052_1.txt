***** THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS - but this determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story ***** <br /> <br /> The story of CINDERELLA is considered my fairy tale prefer. The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale. This can not work if the story deviates or attempts to launch interesting ideas with magical photographs and lavish production designs with poor editing and direction. <br /> <br /> This story of Cinderella is more like an ugly duckling that never hides, or rather, never turns into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the value of production that money can buy, impossible to buy a good cinematic timing and a spectacular development - or a good acting. <br /> <br /> Cinderella's entrance to the ball was so bad that there was no anticipation drama or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> The writing made me very nervous too. Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would a girl want to marry a fierce and egocentric prince who hated women? <br /> <br /> The activation of Turner's role as mother-in-law is a painful and embarrassing demonstration that makes more of a difference than mere nuance. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella party has little interest and sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: so inexpensive the 90s, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in a shameful excess is the glorious photograph , matt work and production design. It was a pleasure to travel through the landscapes, sets and sets as the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some stories of Cinderella, go for two jewels: <br /> <br /> 1) Cinderella Musical of Rodgers and Hammerstein with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious scenic TV - the 60s look like the sets, it's the best version on celluloid - without exception. A cast of stars is doing its utmost to offer the best entertainment possible. Engaging, entertaining and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever After- This jewel of Drew Barrymore maintains the historical perspective, alters the plot, but is not enough to derail the development of the highlights of this classic tale. The characters of the directors and all the secondary roles were well written and acted well.
