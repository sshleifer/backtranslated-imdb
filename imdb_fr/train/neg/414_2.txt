When entering this movie, you know that this film has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So right now, you guess who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly what you expect from them, so no point for the twists and turns of the plot. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if it's a B movie or a movie William Devane plays an important role: the instant status of the movie B. <br /> <br /> The film is promising at first. In the laboratory, we discover the invisible gorilla which becomes more and more violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are some naked breasts, a dirty and very lame joke and enough out-of-the-way swear words to give this movie an R rating that it does not really need. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there are not really any surprises, except when Shue does like MacGyver in the freezer, which is rather a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there is a surprise. Caine (Bacon) returns for the last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise but only because you scream on TV: "Noooo! You are already dead! Finish the movie! Speaking of shouting on television, that's all I did in the last 25 minutes or so. "Put on your safety glasses! Instead of putting their infrared goggles on to see it, they try all the other stuff in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost in the end. But the special effects were good. that's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
