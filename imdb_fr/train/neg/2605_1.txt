Although I recently put it on my list of the 10 worst movies, I must say that it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or one of the following "Look Who's Talking". It's still nauseating, even if the sexy Drew Barrymore plays some sort of horror response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but discovers she's being hunted down by a deadly look-alike. Poor Sally Kellerman, an eccentric actress of great renown in the '70s, is reduced to a minimal secondary role, and Barrymore's lead actor, George Newbern, is the worst type of sitcom actor, always stopping laugh after each line. The picture is blurry, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts of his showmanship and the identity of the psychopath (though it comes from an episode of "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But as for the final ... become real! Who was to clean up this mess? * from ****
