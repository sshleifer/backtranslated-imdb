Well, what can we say about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast by cable. I'm sorry to waste my time but at least I did not waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the cutest you can get! Please, you must be very generous not to get angry at the cheap Halloween costume. Well, there are also awful displays of acting, f / x and dialogue. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can not get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> It's the worst you can get from direct film to video. "Unknown Creature" gives FULL MOON PICTURES movies a "Halloween" appearance. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this trash are the sexy women.
