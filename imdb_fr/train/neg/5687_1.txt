Although not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations, this piece of crud is not much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological incapacity to accept that he does not make good films. One of these days, he will run out of money and stop inflicting bombs on the world. <br /> <br /> The acting game was mediocre, the dialogue sounded like they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll's special touches were seen throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Like all of Uwe Boll's films, this one simply should not exist. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
