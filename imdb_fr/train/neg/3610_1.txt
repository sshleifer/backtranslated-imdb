A patient escapes from a psychiatric hospital, killing one of his guards, then a university professor, after he has gone to the local college. The next semester, the teacher's replacement late and a new group of students will face a new batch of murders. The dialogue is so clich√©d that it's hard to believe that I was able to predict the lines in quotation marks. It's one of those cheap movies that were put together in the midst of the slasher era of the '80s. Although the heroine was killed, it's just an unhealthy junk. Horrific actor play, horrible storyline, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just something to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest looking at your head cleaner tape, it would be more fun. Ignore him and praise "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> R rated for strong visual violence, blasphemy, brief nudity and sexual situations.
