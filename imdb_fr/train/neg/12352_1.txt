<br /> <br /> How did this film ever get an average of 6 stars? The scenario is so banal and frankly an insult to the life on which it rests. Cinematography comes straight from the clever world of advertising and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. However, Demi Moore shows no surprise by participating in this film, if we look at her list of songs. In short, a "high concept" film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
