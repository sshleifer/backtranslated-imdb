Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel.I do not know how he designed this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after 9/11 and the point of view of American society is promising, which makes 2 out of 10. But it's not a movie. Can anyone better with a good idea (the West-East shock). There are important things going on in the Middle East and this has just been posted on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American who is currently at the level of stupidity (because she ignores all the facts ). Characters And what is most important is that the idea given with religion interests me a little. At the end of the scene, Lana says: stay silent and try to listen. And the background music says "... I'm going to pray." The thing is not about religion actually. But it ends up with that. How you will see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray. already shine on the truth. It's just that no one wants to see it. ps: "My house is not a place, these are people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence. But it's a waste behind the making of this movie. (By the way, as "someone" mentioned below, the best young man in the Americas is not the best, it's just the "poor" and the "hopeless" who engage in the military who needs good paychecks that are not provided by the government!)
