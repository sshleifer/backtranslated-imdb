OK, look at the title of this movie. <br /> <br /> The title says that everything is fine? the title is great ... I mean, a lot of things should come to your head after reading it. in fact, you might be extremely impatient to see it. <br /> <br /> Well, unfortunately, you will not see anything of it. <br /> <br /> just a bunch of bad actors, some staggering blood, some hot girls and lesbian action. <br /> <br /> oh, well, I think there are about 5 to 10 minutes of zombies and vampires ... <br /> <br /> get away from there if you want see a good movie. otherwise get it.
