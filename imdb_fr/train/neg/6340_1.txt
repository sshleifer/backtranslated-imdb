This is the kind of movie that I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it presents a glimpse of the Colombian conflict so cliché and silent that it represents an insult to all the Colombian people. The representations are godawul, Grisales (his nude scene is absolutely pitiful) in Bejarano, through Fanny Mickey (which looks like a real nightmare for Tim Burton), through Diaz, which makes a remarkable effort to to give life to a character -dimensional, so cliché and so badly written, all he has to do is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, a gore is so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood shudder. Jorge Ali Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker, but at least his previous films had a certain dignity. I can not say a good thing about this waste of money, except that I hope that Colombian filmmakers will learn the honesty, integrity and responsibility of this lively fiasco.
