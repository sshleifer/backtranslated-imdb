It's a really stupid movie. This could be fun with the extraterrestrials looking nice and the country decor, but that's just not the case. <br /> <br /> Some extraterrestrials hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and pretend. The cover of the movie shows these aliens riding surfboards in space ... not really what they do. They are not extraterrestrials, they are stupid, caricatural idiots with modulating, jarring and acute voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the alien scam of Jack Nicholson who still wears his sunglasses. Apart from the extraterrestrials, the acting is terrible. The writing is obviously intended for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> It's an idiotic movie that only kids will appreciate. <br /> <br /> My note: 1/2 on ****. 100 minutes PG for soft language.
