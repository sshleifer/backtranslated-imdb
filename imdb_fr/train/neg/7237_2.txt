Life is really too short for movies like this one. I knew it could not be good when I realized what I already suspected - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same type of person he plays in "Friends". <br /> <br /> Let's face it, the guy can not play anything other than a nerd or we never offer him other roles. I feel it's a mix of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is extremely difficult to love a film that wastes the considerable talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
