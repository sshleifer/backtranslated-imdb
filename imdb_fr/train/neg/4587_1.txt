Well, what can I say? <br /> <br /> "What the sound knows we know" has accomplished almost the impossible: he left behind masterpieces of the genre "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master" "Merlin", and so fourth, it will go down in history as the worst film I have ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is indeed impressive because I have seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between an idiotic and artificial plot on an extremely annoying subject. photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a bunch of heads discussing the fact that quantum physics is supposed to justify their new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if you start your meditation day with Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a lot of people who know how to have fun and a good deal of good grass, then this movie is for you too. Otherwise, stay away. Believe me on my word. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about "What does the sound know you, do you know?", is that it seems to have been edited and put in place by the same people as those who organize cheap marriages. camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparks across the screen, and other assorted nonsense. Who left these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. I guess that's what Kenny G is doing too much for you. The film was imbued with GCI, which you or I can produce on our own computer via over-the-counter video editing software, but never would, because it's too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The script was obviously written by someone who had no experience of writing. Not only were all the characters and all the conversations heavy and complex, but the "writers" felt that they had to conceal all relevant information, or rather misinformation, as most of the films in this film wanted. your throat. Well, given the target audience, it may not have been such a bad idea. The main character, for example, spends half of the movie popping pills. Apparently, however, this was not considered sufficiently convincing. So there are at least two dialogues that refer to her anti-anxiety pills, in case the viewers would not be able to connect her. little white pills she takes every time she feels depressed. The acting game ... Well, I saw better playing in Ed Wood's movies, and no, that's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little room I played at the age of 12 was much more inspiring than this one. This is really the case. <br /> <br /> The story stops here and there with a group or random conversation heads, a strange mix of wacky scientists, brazen doctors and self-proclaimed mystics. Physics is supposed to provide an "explanation" of how a man or woman created his own reality just by participating in the experience of life. Reality, you see, is a field of probabilities of a lot of different possibilities and is only engraved in marble when the observer has chosen to notice it. What happens when more than one observer observes that they did not say it, but again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, you will be God and nobody cares about things as ridiculous and archaic as critical thinking, logic, etc. Any reason is immediately ruled out because people are stuck in their path and unable to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go down into the rabbit hole". In addition, Heidelberg's uncertainty principle is supposed to prove alternative realities, parallel universes and others. <br /> <br /> With regard to the rabbit holes, this analogy permeates the film. All these people are constantly talking about going down the rabbit holes. I do not know what it has to do with everything they've said or shown, but one thing I'm sure of is that it involves some sort of anal sex. In fact, the film is extremely anti-sexual. In all cases, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-illuminating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, speaking heads speak, the main character attains harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over his body with a magic marker and continues to walk around with a look even more stupid in her glazed eyes than those with which she had begun. <br /> <br /> I want 2 hours of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are some random quotes I remembered: "What I consider unreal has become much more real to me, and what I called real, is often much less real than the unreal." - Some speak head-on about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take for a man to have an erection?" It only takes one thought, nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are on the inside. he has an erection "- A self-proclaimed mystic, responsible for his own school of enlightenment. <br /> <br /> [looking at yourself in the mirror] "I hate you, I hate you, you're fat, you're ugly, I've got you!" - Main character, the big, ugly photographer.
