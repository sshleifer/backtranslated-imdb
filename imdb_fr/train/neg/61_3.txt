There is not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this alleged comedy the only ironic moment of Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script of his play (which is not credited), likens old age to irrational behavior - and, even worse, to clumsy, gallant, irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthless to us, playing an old vaudeville singer who has reunited his former partner for the George Burns comedy for a TV show (it says they have been a team for 43 years, raising the question "how many time did the vaudeville last? "). Burns, who won an Oscar for support, has the misfortune to arrive in the film about 30 minutes, after which Matthau has already exploded the equipment thoroughly. The more noisy the film becomes, the less it is tolerable and viewable. Director Herbert Ross did a solid job only if he was not associated with one of Neil Simon's scenarios; Here, Ross stages gags as a deafening amateur, setting up belligerent routines that give no results (like Matthau, almost incoherent, who shows up in a mechanic's garage to audition a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role and he overcompensates by shuffling and screaming. It was up to Ross and Simon to calm down the character, to temper his temper to give some sunshine to "The Sunshine Boys". Still, Walter continues to project himself as if we were all deaf. The photo is terribly dull and crawls at a pace without spirit; we lose hope for that at the beginning. * 1/2 of ****
