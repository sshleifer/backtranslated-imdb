SICK. really means incredibly puny, I killed myself. There was absolutely no actor to speak of. The best part of the production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this film was enough. Filming took place under Sesame Street. The production resembles that of the underground film for the great successes of the mafia. The props used in this film were stolen from a clothing store. The end was so predictable that you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this film, I'm sure it's better. I would like to avoid that at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that earned the whole movie. I laugh.
