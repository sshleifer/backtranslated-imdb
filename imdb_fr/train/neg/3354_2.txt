In my opinion, when you decide to redo a very good movie, you must strive to do better than the original. or at least give him a new point of view. Now, the 1963 story by Robert Wise of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is still worth the price of admission. Now, fast forward to 1999 and re-make it. I let myself shake my head and ask, why? The acting is wooden, the story is unrecognizable and the essential seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original by as many special effects that computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but I could not believe it was so bad, considering the source. I was wrong. After looking at this and telling my wife how awful it was, she said, "Well, they have your money!" She's right, do not let them take yours. If there is no profit to make rebates ugly, maybe they will stop making them or will reach higher standards that do not insult their audience
