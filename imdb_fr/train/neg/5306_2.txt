OK, I am blessed. I saw two very strong theatrical productions, that of New York with the original cast and that of the representative of San Diego (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you are rock!). Compared to one or the other, the film is almost unassailable. I have been reading the DVD for the last two nights and I still have not finished. Far too many foreign dialogues, and waaay too many scenes and people added. Yes, the four major performances are pretty good, esp. Mrs. Streep's. But comparing the scene to the movie is certainly an example of "less is more". The thickening of the room to satisfy the need for variety and specificity of the landscapes of the moviegoers was not a wise choice. Please, please, go get a production on stage somewhere near you.
