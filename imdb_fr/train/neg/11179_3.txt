Even though we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. An advertising hack at the dirty end of what appears to have been a distinguished and idealistic career Pacino plays his role of resembling a defeated bed and assaulting everyone with a totally false and inconsistent southern accent. unfolds in this way and with so many improbable and improbable things that the mind rolls up (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is here, does not do much. His scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe that they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Tea Leone illuminated the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting of the movie, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
