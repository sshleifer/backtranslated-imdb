A long time ago, X-Files was an intelligent and stimulating show. Much of its appeal was that writers turned to folklore and science for their ideas, connecting the plot with the sinister side of real life. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly suspicious of the 8th season when it aired. The series had already provided two perfectly successful episodes ("One Son" and "Requiem"), and the seventh season had seen a sharp increase in episodes that scraped the barrel for crazy, improbable or downright silly ideas. But I thought, hey, give him the benefit of a doubt, maybe they bring him back because they have good ideas in store. <br /> <br /> "Roadrunners" was really upsetting. After "Patience", which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had avoided, the episode sees a strange parasitic slug endowed with the power of mastery of the spirit worshiped by a worship of Christian foothills. Oh, and they think it's the second coming of Christ, but you'll only find it in the last two minutes. Seriously. There is never * any * attempt to make sense of it, to explain what the slug is, why everything happens, or whatever. Even in the early days of the series - actually * especially * then - we could expect a little more depth, a little context, or otherwise, on the contrary - a little mystery, some uncertainty on the subject. . <br /> <br /> It's Scully who really kills him. You could endure the stupidity of the principle, but having a character developed for 7 years as a rational skeptic turned into a gullible nonconformist for the sole purpose of advancing the plot is strange. It feels like you're looking horrible horrible teenage, except that it's a woman in her thirties who throws herself into the kind of isolated and terrifying community where she spent most of the decade discovering the sinister belly stereotypes or totally indifferent to his own safety. Oh, and besides, Doggett, the new Mudler, is not here. Scully simply went astray in the desert to commit himself alone in a brutal murder. He shows up at the end to save the day - I do not even remember why - but apart from that, he does not really participate. Again, seriously. <br /> <br /> In short, this sounds like a generic script written for another show or someone's pet project that he was allowed to ram like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, longtime show at a time when he was at his most vulnerable. It might have worked in a smaller series, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience is less expecting. But The X-Files had a good chance and Scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic characters on television in the 90's. Decide that you're going to change his personality in the name of a story they had to make on Star Trek a good fifty times is useless.
