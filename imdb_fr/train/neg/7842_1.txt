Caught this by accident on a TV showing - and could not believe how horrible the experience was. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was captivating because it kept the interest of all. But this nonsense - I miss the words. It was bad enough to have some kind of "story" presented with the impact of a wet bread, but this mistake was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles whenever the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For God's sake, would the filmmakers not have found enough North American Indians, who were also actors and quasi-actors, to play as "Indians" in this farrago at the time? place of the impostors they actually used? I also found it very embarrassing to see Richard Harris scroll through the entire campaign at the obvious request of the director who was standing right behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from a useless point A to a useless point B to create sequences and movie minutes. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
