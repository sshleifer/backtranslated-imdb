I'm not one of those who think King is a great writer. His books are good entertainment for a few hours and often have interesting premises. However, in my opinion, they collapse pretty quickly if you give them a serious thought. This film suffers from being a fairly accurate account of King's story. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes to scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, the movie is nothing terrible, it is a horror of "gypsy curse", whose turn is the curse what many people wish, become slimmer. The last third has serious structural problems and the slightly forced end seems to be a bit of a violation of the rules of this kind. <br /> <br /> There are far worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br /> >
