Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's like someone giving a $ 1 billion budget to a third-year autistic student and saying, "make me a movie about the secret services." The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was at best random, each syllable of dialogue was completely delayed and the staging ... well, was there even a director? Everything was so useless and lame and useless ... and random .... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; this movie is the most stupid thing you can see. <br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will also appreciate; Deterrence, dark blue and partial partial lobotomy.
