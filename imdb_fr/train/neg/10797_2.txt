There was a genie played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam and he was singing. His rhymes were lame, these replicas were bad. A stupid kid was crying for his stupid dad. Bad actin, bad casting, bad effects. this film is zero, Prolly did not win 20 dollars, he lives in a boombox, not a lamp is so bad as a cramp, like a stamp of wet food ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, you'll understand it, a stupid genius that rhymes do not act, in a stupid movie with horrible special effects. Oh, and it's confusing. I will not even continue. Let's just say that it belongs to the category "it's so bad, it's funny". Watch it once with your friends and have fun. But do not expect anything spectacular.
