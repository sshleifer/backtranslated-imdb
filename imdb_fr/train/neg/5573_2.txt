I do not understand why so many Godzilla fans think it's great, one of Godzilla's best films to date. This film is horrible and one of the few Gojira movies that I can not stand to see again (the other being G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The intrigue is too trivial to be part of the Heisei series, a series that attempted to turn Godzilla's aging franchise into authentic action movies, addressing ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than in 1991. It seemed ridiculous, especially on certain subjects, like the scene of the Second World War, with the Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a dull and serious tone, take the former exuberant commander turned capitalist and his death , serious moments in a film that his fans in one way or another designate as being played for laughter, like a frolicking madness with a guilty illogical amusement, if this is the case easily one of the most tasteless films I've seen, but I think it's more likely that it's just the talent that was missing from the filmmakers and that it's a right-wing action film that went wrong. This has been made worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible, from jet packs to android through the hokey sound effects emitted by everything, it is impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the film is waiting for you , there is no help to the camera. <br /> <br /> As in almost all of Godzilla's films, romance is useless and is no exception to the rule, although it can be said that it is particularly useless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason presented for romance, it happens and there are 360-degree commitments. On top of that, the other awful aspect of this movie is the dialogue. Japanese and English, it's awful, clumsy and maybe even the inspiration of Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristar DVD aggravates the problems, giving a grainy, fuzzy, weak and just ugly appearance, the same thing was for the sound. I first saw the Japanese version of Region 2 and the differences are day and night, with the original bright colors and texture, the remarkable score, the fight scenes in particular, are really visible. <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little to praise, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is a good example of this failure. He is not even close to deserving the reputation and the fans he receives. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
