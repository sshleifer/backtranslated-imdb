Very mediocre effort offering almost nothing to a fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries, but fails to save the poor structure, the dialogue, the direction or the talent of our leader The only thing that this comforting story of naive new salesman for an alarm company has, it's its odd side characters. But without realistic background, such characters are useless. <br /> <br /> Nothing to do here, keep going ... <br /> <br />
