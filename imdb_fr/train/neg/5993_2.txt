I grew up (born in 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds. All my classmates at school watched. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. Counting from 5 has become an art form. I took my children to see the film hoping to get a glimpse of what I loved in my childhood. What a bitter disappointment. The only highlight was the brightly-themed melody. Not that it can be compared to the original Thunderbird score. Fortunately, early Saturday morning, a television channel still broadcasts the series created by Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes should return his directors chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Ultimate waste. A remake of CGI may be acceptable, but replace the puppet by Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge miscalculation.
