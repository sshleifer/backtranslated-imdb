Yes, this movie is bad. The worst part is that he gets no benefit from his own title !! In the movie ENTIER, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure that the main character of the movie is definitely a vampire. One could say that they were trying to "reduce the level" or make it "realistic", but it ends up being boring. More than half of this film takes place BY CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else are not enough to boast either. In addition, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that for a film of such low production, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with an original score or music sampled elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent films, but it does not seem that it was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than the killer fright."
