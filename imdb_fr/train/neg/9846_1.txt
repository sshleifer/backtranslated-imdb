You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers is there. It would be a mistake. It's one of the most useless movies ever made. I was always waiting for something funny, but nothing funny appears in this film. Even the film industry recognized that it was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. It's a marvel that this has ever been put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract brought Sellers into this movie. I also wonder why the makers of this movie were allowed to make other bad movies. This movie is surely a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of time for anyone watching it. There are surely high school students who would be able to write / produce a film that would be a plot.
