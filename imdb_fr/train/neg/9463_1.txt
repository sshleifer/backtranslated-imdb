A petty and degrading and degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of his ancestor, but lacks any talent whatsoever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of his horrible performance that is a real scam of what Jim Carrey has done, but he should also stop acting in concert. It is so annoying that you would want to get rid of it if you could jump into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but it does not just take the cake, but it's definitely one of the worst movies ever made.
