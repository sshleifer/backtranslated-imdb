Unfortunately, more low than high. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing fancy, but there was a story, unlike other modern horror movies. The other good thing was the casting. I'm not saying that the acting was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks is that the film becomes exciting only after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another drop (or you can think of it as a hike if you want to) is excessive nudity. The 4 girls were naked for a few minutes and all the guys showed their ass for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not "The dreamers". <br /> <br /> Unless you really want to watch a guy take off his swimsuit and run naked for one night. A few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you are a hardcore of Debbie Rochon, then this movie is for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
