Highly reissued and often confusing, the original version of Man On Fire on the screen was at least ten years out of print, and the years that followed did not improve. This is the kind of film that producers with too much money and too little experience do to attract attention and all the others are just doing it to pay their outstanding alimony or drug dealer, with the bodyguard from Scott Glenn going on one leg to save his one year indictment, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. Interesting actors - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello and Jonathan Pryce - have all done better, the action is slow and sparse and only the exceptional score of John Scott (part of which appeared in the last film of Die Hard) makes positive impression. A case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of the director for this version) is an improvement.
