Did they use their entire budget to pay porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> The sound effects, background music and editing in general were so painful that one would think that a 12-year-old would like to be created the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were good considering the scenario ... the "innocent virgin" played her role very well. <br /> <br /> The mutants look very cool and that's true It could have been a really cool movie with the brain right behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately, that's not the case for everyone. <br /> <br /> Turn Left has been made better than this movie and these guys have not done it. I do not even have money !!! Fortunately I did not rent the movie myself!
