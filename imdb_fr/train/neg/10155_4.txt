I read several good reviews that defended and criticized the different aspects of this film. One thing I see, again and again, is the annoyance with Megan, the idealist political scientist, who is trying to change the world. I loved his character. Maybe because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm joining Megan. Besides, she's cute. This is not a great model, but rather a pretty girl next door. <br /> <br /> OK, so she cried and shouted a lot. It's very dramatic and seems exaggerated, but does not that suit his character? She continues this show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She thinks that people who love such a show are sick. I think she has argued very well. Of course, being a naive girl, she is terrified by what she is about to face. I think her actor's play accurately depicts a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. In addition, I think she kept a certain dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> As for the movie in general, aside from Megan, it was pretty much everything I expected. There were excellent scenes gores, according to the norms of the micro-budget. The plot took perhaps a quick thought, almost no contemplation. This is basically just a black and crazy comedy slasher film, as the name suggests. I like the sadism of the doctor. He kept tearing up Megan's shirt, not only for the cause of the malaise (for the most part), but also to torment him before he killed her. The chainsaw hick was hilarious. For moviegoers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this film to 4 out of 10. It had a good decor, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible actors. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a rough diamond that horrifies the micro-budget.
