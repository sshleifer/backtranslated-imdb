I am a big fan of Stephen King. I liked the Running Man. So obviously, I was very excited that someone made a movie. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in paradise. I was ready for a night of entertainment! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had thrown Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man who had become famous for his movies full of rotating movies could play a more devious role, as described in the book. I was still convinced that it would be a good movie, though. Who knows, maybe Arnold had hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not do it. I soon discovered that the only reason he was thrown was because someone had rewritten the whole story to make it a fight. Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: the hero is badly done, the hero solves the problems by playing his powerful muscles and scares everyone and the hero gets the girl back. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book says. I know that books can not be displayed on the screen, but it was not even related to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have banned the use of the title The Running Man for this shameless film waste. I do not say it often, but this movie was bad. If I did not watch at home, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used a lot of "someone." I did it because I'm sure many people are ashamed to have worked on it and I do not want to embarrass them further by naming them here)
