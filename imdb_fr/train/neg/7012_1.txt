My girlfriend and I went to see this film as "First surprise", that is to say we had bought our ticket at the premiere of a movie before it opened here in Denmark. We sat for about an hour and then left! The purpose of the film seemed to be simply to portray the era (and the club 54), but it did at the expense of the development of the character, which there was none, and the plot, for which he there were few. /> I have rarely been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> But the music was good. So, if you like to listen to good music and get an idea of ​​that 70s vibe, I guess it's OK. But do not expect a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
