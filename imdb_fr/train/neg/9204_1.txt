I have seen this movie many times (and recently read the book it is based on) and every time I see it, I just want to slap them all four. The fact that they do not understand the fact that the character of Tom Hank is switching into his character of D & D (Ops M & M) :) ("Oh, he just plays in the character.") out of the play session. That and the fact that after three months of therapy, let's destroy all that and feed its illusions! This kind of person is what gives RPG bad name. <br /> <br /> The "love ballad", and the music of "cat at the piano" and "stop us if we are too boring" are also almost enough to put teeth in place!
