Currently, this movie is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst movie of all time - this is exactly why I rented it to NetFlix. However, I am saddened to say that the film, although bad, is not far enough to deserve to be in the list of the last 100 films ever made. I have personally seen at least 100 worse films than this one. An approval just barely praise, but it just did not reach the level of atrocity planned to appear on this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their honeymoon, they are married in real life too). It is a doctor obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a cave nearby. Once there, they behave very very stupidly (characteristic of a bad movie) and are quickly bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the United States - which is not at all true. <br /> <br /> Oddly, after being bitten, the man does not even bother going to the hospital !! The first thing everyone thinks about (especially a doctor) is to get medical help right away, but not that ass. Soon, he has epileptic seizures - and yet, he does not ALWAYS want to ask for help! Again and again, you continue to think that it must be the most stupid couple in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> After a while, he finally goes to a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But at this point, it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins to kill people to suck his blood. When it's absolutely obvious to everyone that this man is a crazy killing machine, his wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit brain) refuses to believe that it is dangerous - even after having attacked people, stole an ambulance and headed a woman. Police car of the road !! <br /> <br /> Now, most of the time, Moss is experiencing these episodes, his eyes are narrowing and he looks like a normal person. Oddly enough, however, he has developed bat-like hands several times and, in the end, they have used nice prosthetics on him to make him look a lot like bats. If it had been really cheesy, the film would have deserved a 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a twist that makes little sense, the woman inexplicably turns into a crazy bat lady and A swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. All this was a mystery, as were Moss and McAndrew who were convinced that this film would help them in their careers - although they both have a long career on television, playing a small role since 1974. <br /> <br /> very stupid. The plot is stupid and makes no sense and relies heavily on people who act too foolishly to be real. Not a good movie at all, but not among the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb displays the graphic of the three DVD set for IT'S ALIVE and its two suites of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. Although THE BAT PEOPLE was seen with the title "It's Alive", the two films are not linked at all. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since their release in 1974, but the film I just reviewed features Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other movie starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
