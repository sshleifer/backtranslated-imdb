Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, except for a woman who was bleeding inexplicably. Second, it was not scary. Third, he had the worst soundtrack of all movies. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited by Beavis or Butthead? I do not know which one, so let's go with Beavis. The movie becomes quieter and people mumble and mumble, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched it at home). Then Beavis emits loud sounds with supposedly scary / shocking images, which forces you to turn down the volume quickly. This happens several times until, fortunately, the movie ends. I can imagine Beavis laughing roughly from behind the one-way mirror while watching the test group frantically reach the remote each time. If you have kids and prefer to watch horror movies after they fall asleep, this one is a big mistake. But it's a big mistake anyway. Here is a thought ?? if you want to make a horror movie, add at least one free decapitation, a 19-year-old blond girl who screams loudly just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten living just out of the reach of the camera, a cat being thrown against the camera to scare the audience, a funny weird with a maniacal laugh, or a monster that looks like a stage hand covered with aluminum foil (Lost in Space of TV ). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
