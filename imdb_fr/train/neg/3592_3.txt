For a series of fans, I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad. However, the review of this series can not be based on the fact that it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I think they are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But do all this work. Shoot all these resources. By taking all this time, and always all these faults. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting game, and the aftershocks are terrible. For the majority. The dialogues belong to a military show of the 70s, not to Star Trek. The captain (Mr. Squinty) seems about to burst out laughing at any moment. And most characters just read their lines. Administrators should be aware that "resume" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also suppose that the series is made in the manner of "Two Takes Frakes", which has directed many episodes and films of TNG. I could not help thinking that most of the actors were typical Trekkies. Without going further in this hypothesis. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern for the whole project is the quality of the publications. When they decided for the first time to devote so much time and resources to this series, why did not they make it available in decent quality? Using the fast time format, with low low resolution is a loss of talent. Even "high" episodes are considered poor quality compared to standard quality series. The Xvid codec, with a higher resolution and file size, would have greatly improved the experience. If the tape with problems was the problem, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved this problem. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the team decides to brush the series, and maybe release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project deserves.
