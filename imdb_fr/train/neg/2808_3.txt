A cast of guest actors from 1980s movies and TV series (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, among others) in the story of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people start being killed, causing all sorts of complications. <br /> <br /> The finished thriller is not very good and has enough nudity and violence to get the R score, but not enough to create real interest. This is described as the kind of movie that gave the Cinemax cable channel the alternative name of Skinamax. I really do not see the point of watching this unless you need to see all the sordid thrillers that exist. (I must also say that this film is filled with tobacco, to the point that it becomes laughable when someone lights)
