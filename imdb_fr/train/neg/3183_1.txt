Sergio Leone turns in his grave ... If there is a film that tramples the work of the life of a man, it is this one. The "lone wolf" bravery of the main character is uninteresting and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight-year education. Whoever had the idea should be flogged. The only reason I spend time criticizing him is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should take legal action, not because of her shit, but because she is now immortalized as a shit by MST 3000. Too bad. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey bullshits that will not offend anyone except cocaine users and weapons experts ... this film is pure blasphemy.
