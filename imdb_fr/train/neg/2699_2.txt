I have not read any IMDb comments for this film that mentions how the Jewish character of this movie jumped like a baby while a gun is pointed in the face by a racist skinhead while the black main character of the movie had the air is severe. the barrel of a gun. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not strongholds of tolerance as they are supposed to be and that the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not print his characters with such large caricatures. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he tries to portray the character of Ice Cube. as a villain, prompting Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduated at the end of the film's redemptive epilogue? It seems that Singleton points to white as being incapable of empathy (I did not say sympathize!) With his black student comrade OR only able to take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Women who are raped do not turn to lesbianism, which is described more as a cult than a way of life. Very honestly, what was the purpose?
