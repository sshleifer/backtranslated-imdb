This is the first time I see a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it will be my last. I did not see why he was funny, although the audience found it very funny when he was facing the camera or saying "I'm going to take a shower". <br /> <br /> the plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the nice guy. The good guy has a wife, so the bad guy uses it. Between the two, the officials will go crazy. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you do not do the work at home to solve a trivial conundrum? <br /> <br /> There is no great acting, there is not much conspiracy and the shooting is done in the manner of MTV. Do not waste your money with this one. <br /> <br />
