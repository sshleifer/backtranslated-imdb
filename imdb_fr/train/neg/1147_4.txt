This movie is part of F.B.I.'s story because Knott's Berry Farm is in the west. Unscrupulous version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crackdown on crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have others?) Throughout his film with quality actors, cheese sets, cheap sound effects and lighting presents every known c-lister in the midst of fifties with a hint of irony or humor, from the "Amazon jungle" to "barbecue in the yard", all that stinks the sound stage and the backstage. Even the shots are canned and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Apart from some (very rare) shots of interesting outdoor establishments, there is nothing remarkable here beyond a curio.
