I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it was so horrible here. It was easy enough to watch (at 3am). Kevin Dillon's role as a sociopathic serial killer was very believable - it was both charismatic and scary. The rest of the main characters were not that bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple can not conceive, so they will seek help in a fertility clinic. A sociopathic "genetic material" donor focuses on the recipients and, as a typical stalker, interferes with their lives. more and more obsessed with raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course, things do not work for him as he had planned. Not a bad line of intrigue. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes have been horrible. I'm pretty tolerant of movies (especially at 3am!) .. but I was amazed at how close the end was. In fact, I laughed! <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst film I've seen, but I would not be able to watch it again (unless I forget the ending). The role of Kevin Dillon was one of the best serial killers of all time. <br /> <br /> Try to watch the other channels before watching this .. But, if nothing better works, I try it .. =)
