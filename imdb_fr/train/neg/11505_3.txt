This image reminds me of a 1957 photo of Keneth More called "The Admirable Crighton" as he was a servant on the boat and he became the master of the island and was saved, he became a servant. Well, some movies do not shoot, if there are pictures showing that Madonna can not play, that's it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure it's 'a subtle copy of' The Admirable Crighton ', but it does look like If it suits you and so be it, Hollywood must be running out of ideas and it's unfortunate to provide actors with a flat -forms them to improve their career profile, which is a failure in every detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose and the actors play mediocre.The scenario should have been put in the shredder before moving it on the spot While many people here have put Madoona canned for all its game, I think q ue in movies like pretty good and nice and "Who's That Girl" showed a weirdness of Madonna's style not shown either before or after. Madonna's other films are not so nice and I would have liked to see a series of Madonna Animation with the character of "Who's That Girl". I like the music of these two movies, but "Swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so. <br /> <br /> everyone has a bomb, right?
