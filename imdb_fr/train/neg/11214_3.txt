I also saw this film at a local screening about a year ago. First of all, I'll say it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic filmmaker. I just wish the movie was as good as it looks. I would not call it a horror movie. Adding some images of a rotting ghost does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the whole movie. The acting was good, I suppose, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Vengeance can be deadly" ... really? ... they should have checked how many hundreds of horror movies / thriller movies have exactly the same slogan? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say some of these things, but I know a lot of people who have worked on this movie and I know they do not want people to smoke their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
