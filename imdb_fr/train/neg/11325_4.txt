In the devastated desert of the future, humanity is terrorized by Cyborgs' "human-made robots" that have discovered a new source of energy: human blood. Commissioned by their vicious leader Jōb (Lance Henriksen), the Cyborgs are preparing to overtake Taos, a densely populated human outpost. <br /> <br /> A single force can stop Jōb's death march, Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy Jōb and his army. <br /> <br /> In the ruins of a sacked village, Gabriel finds Nea (Kathy Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were murdered by Cyborgs ten years earlier. Now she wants revenge. They conclude a pact: Gabriel will train Nea in the fight against the Cyborgs and Nea will lead Gabriel to Taos. <br /> <br /> The five-time kick-boxing champion, Kathy Long, has all the qualities for this high-speed adventure that offers a lot of action. Stars also Gary Daniels (like David) and Scott Paulin (like Simon).
