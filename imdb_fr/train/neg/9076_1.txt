It was probably the most stupid, rude and repulsive movie I've seen in a long time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as in the fascination of watching a horrible car accident, I literally found HATEABLE in every conceivable way and dragged it to the end. I am in no way a prude who opposes the comic representation of antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, there's something about Mary, the two American Pie movies, and even the infamous Freddy Got Fingered that I found extremely enjoyable on their own raw terms. Mamie Van Doren's sponge bath is the most horrible aspect of a naked geriatric since The Shining. The film ends, without the benefit of making me laugh once. Editing and filming took place with incredibly boring performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman. The only useful purpose of the film is to serve as a classic example of how not to paint a huge picture. Oh, and that would serve as lawn fertilizer as well.
