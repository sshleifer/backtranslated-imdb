One thing is essential to enjoy The Indian Runner. Unzip your pants. Peek inside. Are there signs of a Y chromosome? OK, you will do. <br /> <br /> This film has everything to please men: blood, firearms, car chases, affectionate women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what am I excluded? - oh, yes, blowtorches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I sincerely hope that Sean Penn sees this as an effort when I was a child. Since he wrote and realized the thing, he is almost alone responsible. An uneven distribution (Viggo Mortensen, as usual, brilliantly demonstrates how the job must be done) is trying to save Penn. Too late. The lines and the action are there. Even dedicated and skilled actors can not change it. <br /> <br /> I found this film both childish, silly and predictable. The dialogue continues - Sandy Dennis respects my respect for trying to bring to life a maternal monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, the father of the protagonists, played by Charles Bronson, does the same. Their absence is barely noticeable. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the pyrotechnics, etc., mentioned above seem to enliven things and scare the audience into believing that something meaningful is happening. <br /> If you are a man and are under 25, you can love this movie. Expect to return to 35 years. Do you think you will still love him? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
