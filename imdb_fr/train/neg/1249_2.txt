What a disappointment, especially given the budget, available technical resources and talent. The fundamental rule for science fiction / drama is to create in the public the voluntary suspension of unbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning and bawls, but later, Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have an active brain. Helena Bonham Carter's greatest libertarian of the chimpanzee, the uselessness of the confinement of humans, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary riding skills (it is an astronaut and a group of human primitives who parade suddenly), the immediate human rebellion is too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never projects an impression of fear, danger or real feeling in this upset world. Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nudity captured metaphorically his helplessness and astonishment at the turn of the situation. The Wahlberg in uniform retains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in a fundamentally delusional situation, and we never really question his well-being. Unlike Heston, he never seems to be really threatened. Tim Burton should have used part of the f / x budget for a competent scenario script. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have never bothered to deal with the strike threats of screenwriters and directors. Let them walk. The trained monkeys could have done as well as in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet repeated readings of this effort will be nonexistent. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another lost opportunity.
