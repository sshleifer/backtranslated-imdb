This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi suggest that it is a humorous gangster film. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous female role begins with a number of twists and turns of ridiculous intrigues that hide little artificial end. The film oscillates between comedy (description used vaguely) and surreal drama with some adult scenes out of context thrown in it. The main woman (the title angel) is misinterpreted and the actress is not helped by the scenario that requires incredible effects, character extremes to describe. James Belushi is the only one to manage his role well, but he is also left behind by his poor scenario. One to avoid.
