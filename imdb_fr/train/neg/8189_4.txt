It's always hard to let a brother or sister cope better in life, to struggle to get out of this shadows and not to let bitterness take you away from your family. So imagine that your big brother is Santa, and then imagine how difficult it must be. That's the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays incumbent Fred, an embittered loser who devotes a lot of energy to ensuring that people do not expect good things to happen to them or to give their brother Santa (interpreted by Paul Giamatti), too laudable to simply be the guy in the spotlight, greedy for fame and slightly scary that Fred would like to give him as a portrait. So, would you not know, Fred needs a financial favor and must compensate for this by helping his brother during the Christmas preparations. And hilarity and life lessons flow from it. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring some good moments from Vaughn's patented quick talk, a ridiculously extravagant moment, where Kevin Spacey plays a listener to end Santa's operation (and he's one of them the weakest villains I've seen for some time), not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his pixie outfit (to be fair, he's a nail) and a film that also swims in bitterness to have the impression of being a good seasonal dish and being too schmaltzy in its last half to feel amused to get into all the bad sides of the commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is also here. Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like her style, you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is not much else to recommend this seasonal stinker. Apart from Vaughn's howls, the screenplay barely reveals anything decent, except for one particularly successful scene featuring a hilarious support group that addresses a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin's direction is as mediocre and as solid as the 20p Christmas card you send to the aunt that you have not seen for 10 years and he seems to believe that the simple act of gathering the ingredients without a good mix or decent care will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we have a burnt and sweet mass with too much sugar on top. Forget that and put on the hilarious elf again if you want a great modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like: Santa Claus 2, Santa Claus, Santa Claus 3: The escape clause.
