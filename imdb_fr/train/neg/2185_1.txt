... or an audience. A quick summary .... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor who is experimenting with stolen parts of the body for a vague reason. He wants to perfect the grafts, but believes he must do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately and conveniently, his fiancee is cut off in a car accident for which he is responsible. Agonized with grief, he keeps his head in a lasagna pan (or is it a strudel?) And the pump full of adrenoserum (sic) to keep it alive. And then she wakes up, she says (so to speak) although her neck has been cut to the vocal cords, and since she has no lungs, she could not speak even if she had any. It seems that the poor ungrateful does not appreciate all that her fiance has done for her. Like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then, his grief turns into fad, because he sees the possibility of grafting the head of his beloved on the body of the first bimbo lousy he can pick up on the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a sort of Igor convenience store, enters into philosophical conflict with the head, which has forged a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). Finally, the screenwriter realizes that he can not continue to inflict his misogyny and his fear of intimacy to the public to infinity. He kills everyone, then probably goes to the bank to cash the check before the film's backers have a chance to stop the payment. above. <br /> <br /> Have I already mentioned that I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies not to show this mounted version without the bloody stuff. The sight of the wizard with his arm torn, moving around the house in a circle without leaving much blood anywhere is too precious.
