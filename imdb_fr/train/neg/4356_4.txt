As I am not a fan of blood and guts, I found the bloody scenes totally useless (you spell it) and too real for my taste, if you are the kind of person who pulls his stone from decapitation on Internet or snuff films I "Go on, go crazy, it makes us believe what kind of person dreams this sick shit. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it had the potential to be a good movie, the music was also first class (through the film and especially the end credits), but some parts were a bit unbelievable, as if your girlfriend had just found you confident waiting for torture and death and all you did was tell him what had happened and how you got there (why did not he ask her for wipes or even fresh air or a piece of chewing -gum while there was?), go now, most would like to just scream "hurry up and take me off so let the f *** come out of here FAST!" where were the flies, maggots, etc., and when the girl came across the place by chance, the smell of rotten flesh would certainly have triggered some alarm bells! I would only recommend this film to Dennis Niellson's friends, etc. I'm sure a video like this would give sick people such a Christmas a very nice Christmas.
