Hmm, please forgive me, but was not missing more than half of the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and repeatedly trying to escape. He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by police inspector Javert. On the way, LOTS of characters were not in this version. Fantine, Cosette, M & Mrs Th√©nardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character of the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the movie, trying to see how it related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
