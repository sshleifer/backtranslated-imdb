It's hard to make an unbiased judgment about a film like this that has had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is without a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film. I had the misfortune to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. I saw him again earlier this year and I was horrified again. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fanatic or a fanatic who can say what others should or should not see, but I got pissed off about how something as horrible as rape was treated in this film. I love lowbrow cinema but it's just nasty. Rent Rus Myer instead.
