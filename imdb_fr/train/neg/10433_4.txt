The fight scenes were great. I loved the old and new Cylons and the way they painted the ones on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was the land but 150k back. But go all the way to start all over again? I hope you are joking? 38k people who fought for their very existence and once in paradise, abandon the technology? No way. Of course, they ate paper and rationed their food, but it's over. They can live like humans again. They only have a good doctor. What will they do when someone has a toothache without talking about childbirth ... yes, yes. Nobody would have made that choice.
