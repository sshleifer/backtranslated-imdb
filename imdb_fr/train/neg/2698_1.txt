This film shows how racist John Singleton is. He describes whites and other races that are not black like the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is this same educational system that has made him what he is and has failed. The character of Ice Cube is the epitome of a black man behind most of the acts of violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationship between white and black characters trying to touch each other. When Omar Epps says, "I need to be with my people," this racist remark speaks loudly. And John, do not think for a minute that Thomas Jefferson's image on the tower stairs did not catch my attention. Nice touch!
