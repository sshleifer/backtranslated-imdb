This rather conventional film about flying swords and fists is an early demonstration of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and some sword work is really remarkable. Unfortunately, the film is under the burden of a monotonous story and a disproportionate budget (check some fixed battle scenes if you have any doubts about me). Nevertheless, it's worth the trip, especially if you can catch in mailbox.
