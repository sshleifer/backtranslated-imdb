I guess this film seduced me both by the sound of the story and by the main actor. So I gave Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers) a chance. Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush). He is forced to flee to form a gang and go against them to erase his name and that of his family. That's all I can say about this story, because I did not pay the closest attention to the truth. With Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore in the role of Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the movie has catchy moments, especially with a shootout late, but I can not say I enjoyed the game because I do not have everything looked. . Okay!
