I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to make a rather stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula was actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because that explains his disdain for everything Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea did not materialize. I see this film more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay for his contribution before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the audience (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. In fact, I appreciated the special features of the DVD more than the movie itself.
