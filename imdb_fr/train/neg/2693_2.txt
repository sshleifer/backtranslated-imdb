<br /> <br /> Although the main actress is incredibly beautiful, the plot is unlikely to be accepted, as there are too many distracting details confronting the audience during the course of the story. <br /> <br /> It may be thought that middle-class teenagers in the 1950s easily gave in to their virginity without thinking about the marriage they barely had with the 30-year-old marriage, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One might think that young high school teens are very confident and self-confident when interacting with their elders in complex social situations, but in my experience, teens feel very uncomfortable and clumsy when they are experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> One would think that an experienced doctor would not know the pungency of stroptomycin - the smelly byproduct of the fermentation of occupied terrestrial microbes - and would not detect that a dead, stale powder was wrong, but I do not think so. We can believe that troublemakers in their thirties can enter a public school recreation room and drag inside it in a school. social activity, but I think the social activities of the school are traditionally a protected environment and that parents, chaparones and school staff would be present to prevent it. <br /> <br /> One last word, throughout Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends have qualified a quartet. There is probably an explanation for why FIVE was the FOUR, but since it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie did not sound right for me.
