If Edward Woodward was watching this film, that would be a horror of horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry guys, but enough is enough. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this. What are the similarities? No, it's not really a coincidence if Maurice Micklewhite, the star of the originals, and the other British actor. The main ingredient of the films is the main ingredient of these originals. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were original English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that simply can not be reproduced in the United States. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult movie than to bastardize it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task before even taking the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic than other so-called cult movies; it defies genre, intelligent scripts, first-rate actors, the score, sets that defy the description and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> Here is a remake. Do not worry. No original was hurt in making this remake. Some major aspects of history had to be reworked for the modern United States: communications, paganism, and virgins. But that's about all the principle. So we give the cop a traumatic Nam-style past with shocking music flashbacks for cheap alerts. Then, in the absence of a cell phone mast on the island that sorts communication - but in the real world, this would not happen. The cops do not disappear. Give him a blood tie for motivation rather than shock of beliefs and you have the remake. Is the wafer thin, right? <br /> <br /> It's just that everything was laid with a trowel. The name changes were simply simple, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no center of the city to make its mark, just a few houses scattered in a forest and that was it. Willow was just annoying about giving no information and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he entered the well, you knew he would be locked. The scenario was indicated until the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and finish. The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This end is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. We finish in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrible day. The other ends with an explanatory explanation of post-production explaining everything. <br /> <br /> I liked the original, but I went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the movie. I was grateful knowing that this movie would probably end up under a highway somewhere, but this time happily forgotten forever.
