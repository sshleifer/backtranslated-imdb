Recovery is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. There is nothing horrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a good style. First of all, I do not see how so many people can think that this piece of shit is such a good movie. If I wrote something as boring and absolutely ridiculous as this one, I would make fun of myself and be too embarrassed to submit others to the stupidity of it. Secondly, the acting is terrible and the lead actress is extremely ugly. Third: the story is nil, it has already been used and the excuse that it is not a cheap movie is not an excuse. Read the summary on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes to lose something that will make you regret watching it. I feel really bad for these crooks and the irony of their name. Hi everyone Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
