I rented "New Best Friend" in the hope of a film similar to fun teen thrillers, such as "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" looks much more like "The In Crowd", in which there are no chills and where the acting is incredibly wrong. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events of the movie are the same. Pass this movie ... it's a waste of time.
