I would not recommend this unless you are keen on David Copperfield and want to "complete the package". There are good performances (for example, Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (eg shots), but overall, it's really derisory compared to the 1999 version of the BBC, as well as previous versions. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in history that are really worthless, if not, eventually, to make them dumb (stolen jewelry is an example). The American cast was badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is mistaken as Betsy Trotwood and her English accent is only slightly better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; however, it does a little too much and becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines with an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply ridiculous. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but he is almost expected to put on a black cloak and tie David's mother to a railroad (though it may be partly Dickens' fault ). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with a newspaper. It helped me spend a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than charmed at the end.
