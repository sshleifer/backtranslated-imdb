Now, I will not deny that when I bought this off eBay, I had high expectations. It was an incredible work of the master of comedy that I appreciate so much. However, I was soon disappointed. Apologies to those who liked, but I just found the Compleat Al very hard to watch. I had a few smiles, of course, but most of the fun things came from music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was mostly loaded. You could say that it was not Al's biggest video achievement (this honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt that this will allow to switch to DVD, so if you are an ultra-hardcore Al fan and you MUST own everything, buy the tape on eBay. Just do not pay too much for that.
