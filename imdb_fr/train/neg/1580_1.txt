it became a cult movie in Chinese students, although I did not watch it until it aired on channel4 in the UK. <br /> <br /> full of crazy pretensions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; "The spirit" he wants to convey is the way independent artists "resist the commodification of the music industry" and maintain "the purity of their artist's soul" without "selling themselves for dirty money". it's really dizzying and superficial; the diologists are mainly pathetic. to play is poor. Sceenplay is full of artistic pretension. it's a fantastic movie for kids and it's all <br /> <br />
