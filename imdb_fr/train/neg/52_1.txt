I was excited to see a Catalu√±a film in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation, I was totally disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like all wars, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not very pretty at all, is shown in countless movies and plays, as well as in homosexual relations and Spanish skepticism about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga is trying is a pseudo tragedy that can be one of the worst in the film's history. It's a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not advise anyone to go under any circumstances see this movie.
