This film has several main flaws. The first and most significant is the obvious lack of a good plot! This unfortunately makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also sends the viewer some feelings of hopelessness, as if he were wasting precious time in their short lives. This means that the film can not captivate its audience, but rather encourages the audience to grow up in contempt of the film and all that is associated with it! In short, it's really very very very very very very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew a big rubber shoe, you will find it much more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
