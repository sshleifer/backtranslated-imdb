A saga of "misadventures in the army" that half-heartedly attempts to be surreal (foreign subtitles) AND vulgar (flatulence gags), but ends up just being a mixture of a lot of humor from between they followed with great success. Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl of "The spy who loved me", has only two or three brief scenes. Such a waste! (* 1/2)
