Large distribution. Excellent game Unpredictable story for the first half <br /> <br /> time approx. I really wanted to know what would happen <br /> <br /> to each of these unredeemed characters, and how their seemingly disparate lives would become inextricably linked. But when <br /> <br /> the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they <br /> <br /> mistakenly used the super glue and immobilized the film <br /> <br for the last two hours. I kept thinking that it would be better, but <br /> <br /> it was getting worse. Do not believe the critics. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made ugly - why? The gorgeous bartender <br /> <br /> alive with braces - why? I know this has to do with <br /> <br /> the plot, but without them, at least <br /> <br /> there would have been an attractive actor to remember.
