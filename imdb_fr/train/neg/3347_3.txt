I do not know why I like Dolph Lundgren. I guess seeing it on the screen gives me the feeling that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a positive feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other journals show how stupid the detention is, but many fail to emphasize the positive aspects. <br /> <br /> Any movie in which at least one annoying teenager is killed can not be so bad. Why do so many films made up of teenagers always have to include stereotyped teenagers? Are there not other types of teenagers? Does each group of teenagers have an angry Black? A nerd genius that no one likes? A very friendly slutty girl and (in this movie) pregnant? A white anti-social child disturbed by a broken home that everyone agrees on is talented (but what is the talent?). And a laid-back black kid who listens to the Universe and is so cool that all other neurotic children trust him. Then add some generic teens consumables of all colors. They do not say much but get shot at some point. <br /> <br /> The detention would have been better if the bad guys had managed to blow up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) end up hijacking a van full of drugs, they sit inside the pickup truck. They drive the van to school because they want to repaint the van at the school's paint shop, but they can never repaint the van. By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in one or two cars or a truck or van and leave without repainting the police van. In addition, they never move drugs, do not sell them and do nothing else with a high score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) although, when the bad guys go back to school, no one knows it remotely because it's after school hours. The handful of people still in school has nothing to do with vehicle painting, so why pick on them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this film is that the bandits are all armed with many machine guns and they keep finding teenagers (including a guy in a wheelchair ) and that they shoot hundreds of bullets as teenagers and generally miss them. Towards the end of the film, there is bloodshed. Every time someone is shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that are missing. The waterfalls are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the critics saying that this film had a budget of 10 million dollars and I am amazed. When I saw the film, I thought Lundgren might have done it as a charity for a film school where he is the teacher. As maybe this movie was their end-of-year exam. It was a test to watch, but I succeeded.
