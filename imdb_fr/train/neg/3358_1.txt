The haunting. A remake, of course. The original movie was a scary psychological thriller that has improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritarian brain, the type "I'm going to get out of here", the reading rat so sensitive). But, considering how they bet on special effects as a "star", I guess the characters you can sympathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Wet cherubes, stretched doors, irritating dead children who can not speak clearly ... and an idiotic and sober ending who do everything possible to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. I will take my bowling orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I love you since "The Cowboys". Stop that.
