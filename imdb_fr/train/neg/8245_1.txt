I can not believe anyone liked this movie. I saw a lot of low-budget independent films, but this one was absolutely nil. A small budget does not mean that the movie has to be crazy. Horror does not mean that the movie must be crazy. This film was not scary. It was just a bloody and particularly troubling party. The acting was average, considering that they were all unknown actors, but the story was pathetic, the pathetic dialogue. The film is trying to become "artistic", or something like that. It's not one of those very big independent movies that cost only thousands of dollars, but are incredibly well done. It was nothing more than an excuse for extremely sick people to put their evil obsessions on the film. Other critics here have also stated that the soundtrack was void ... that's because most of them were written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the film. There was no quality that bought this movie. A total loss of my time and money.
