It was a less than exciting short film I recently saw between Turner Classic Movies. Although the film appeared because of its intense Technicolor, the film itself was not so moving and sometimes the plot looked pretty old-fashioned-as if it were meant for classroom use and captured the attention of a wider audience a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - as when the characters had spoken to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "Madame", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". In addition, a sick Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a Confederate rebel, ..." - almost as if he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. It was just a sloppy handwriting. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" in the show SUPERMAN) in a beard as President Garfield. Yes, it's him under this beard.
