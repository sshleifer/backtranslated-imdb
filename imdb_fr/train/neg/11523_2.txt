"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally inept and hilarious hippie horror movie buff. Apparently, even twenty years later, Charles Manson still inspired enthusiastic but incompetent filmmakers. This is a typical production of Troma, which means that there are a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding sequences to accompany the absurd plot. Is there some free nudity and random gore ?? which is not bad ?? but it's so useless and ugly that watching becomes frustrating. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that it even uses a lot of footage twice, like the circle seen killing, for example. The incoherent plot attempts to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the addict and Charlie Manson, an aspiring, Paul. Igor, one of Paul's inferior disciples, becomes a little too obsessed with biblical stories and orgies of drugs and gradually brings the whole cult to sink into criminal madness. Just to illustrate, through a small example, how crazy Igor is: it tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitchhiker! There's an annoying synth soundtrack and some really annoying pseudo-artistic camera stuff, like slow motion footage and sordid dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that deserves more or less to be described as worthy of interest by garbage fanatics: it is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera keeps the blade shooting in the bloody stomach for fifteen seconds.
