I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A double life" and the funny "Born yesterday" and co-wrote scripts as excellent as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon, then the one who wrote and / or directed such boring, drivel drivel like "Bachelor Mother", "A kind of nut", and that. The actors are trying, but the screenplay is so tired and clich√©d that even the efforts of the ever-wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The scenario is sinking into the really offensive sequence in which the character of Janssen tests the character of Drivas to make sure he is not gay. An ugly sequence, but unfortunately, that could be easily reproduced in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten, but "fag" jokes are always "good, clean and fun for the family".
