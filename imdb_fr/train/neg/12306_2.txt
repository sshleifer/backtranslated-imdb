This film is a pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but even he can not save the tired idea and the Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do not think the comments of other users reflect the bad rating that this movie has received (and deservedly deserved!). This is extremely misleading. I have often seen this film go down to $ 3.00 at the grocery store and now, I certainly know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could recover my 90 minutes ...
