It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although featuring good actors, the film does not meet expectations. What is most dramatic in this film is the music, which sums up the film pretty well: to compensate for a dark and confusing scenario by having well-known actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the fact that it's a very boring movie to watch. Won a score of 1.
