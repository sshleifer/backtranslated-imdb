This sly and homophobic object dated back to 1976. It seems to be particularly petty now, filled with gay stereotypes and characters intended to make people laugh, not to make people laugh. Redd Foxx does his classic, Michael Warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one - dimensional character, and Pearl - Pearl, what were you thinking--? Pearl Bailey deserves a lot better.
