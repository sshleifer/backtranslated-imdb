So, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American Pie movie in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three films of American Pie, except that some characters are supposed to be related to the characters of the original trilogy and that Eugene Levy is there (the guy can not get any best concerts?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to congratulate for this movie. There are no funny jokes. The acting game is painful to watch, especially the girl with the accent "south" that sounds more like an impersonation by a Canadian of a British woman claiming to be a hill, using the word "ya'll ". This film makes me feel like an idiot. Why did not I apply to a college where no one goes to class (but everyone has good grades), girls constantly undress in public, everyone has unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate family photos of a girl everywhere without getting involved? Really, this series has lowered to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next, they will eventually collapse and engage Ron Jeremy as leader. I'm sure they can simply link it to the show by removing the third uncle from his character, Stifler, or something.
