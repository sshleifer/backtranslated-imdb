Really bad shot on a "movie" video directed by not one, not two, but three amateur directors. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a bad horror movie, throw at least a little blood, blood nudity. There is blood supplied by latex-cut accessories purchased from a Halloween store. There are lesbians and prostitutes but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but just talk. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no mounting effect - melts, wipes, etc. From time to time, a little black appears to separate the scenes. <Br /> <br /> A dreadful music of bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up most of the ending credits. The werewolves are represented by rubber masks glued to the "actors" face. They did not even bother applying brown makeup on the neck, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10 year old child with a video camera could make a better movie. No reason to buy, rent, or watch this movie except as an example of how not to make a low-budget video.
