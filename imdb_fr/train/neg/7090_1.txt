I fell asleep on my couch at 19:35 last night while watching Larry Sanders (I usually use it with DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3am (investment banker on the west coast) and I'm fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked by the poverty of this "film". Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. It's really bad. The writing is boring, but the editing and editing are simply inferior to those of a freshman at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video. Remember that it's filmed in video, not digital video. It looks like a soap opera. Skateboard video clips have a more "filmed" feel than this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the bad realization but I really can not remember anything. The firing and blocking are stupid. yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not daring, not daring, not boring, just stupid. I know that people who read this advice will say "give me an example". I can not. It was 3am. but believe me, I know you'll watch it anyway, you'll be seduced by the horrible criticism. <br /> <br />
