Oh, a vaguely famous actress in a movie where she plays a mother to a child. It's broadcast on the BBC 1 at half past midnight, I wonder if ... yes, it's a TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give it to TVM producers, not happy to make a mediocre film , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed and where NULL HIDE is no different. The first theme is a woman in danger whose theme is pollinated with a woman who is suffering from a divorce. So we have a scene of the heroine surviving an attempted murder followed by a scene where her son Sam asks why she divorced? And as TVM, she responds that the reason is "That people change" rather than saying something like "I'm a good drummer" or Your dad organizes sex in the public restroom "as it happens in real life divorce cases, and I'm sorry for young Sam, not only are his parents divorced, but he's as thick as two little boards, in fact, he's so stupid that he deserves no sympathy because he does not know that a man throws toilet is a drug dealer, unaware that you risk dying if someone shoots you and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unusual.If only our own childhood was so innocent, oh yes, as Orwell said, "Ignorance is the force." Oh, wait, Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life, character development or bad scripts, I know what my money is on. And strange that Sam's genius Did not notice that if the story unfolds in 1994, why often wear clothes, drive cars and take the train since the 1950s? it turns out that during a plot, it is the mother who is the manikin. Then there is one last piece of land that left me feeling like an idiot to watch this
