I should qualify this title now that I think about it. The cash register is not entirely worthless. I had the opportunity to see him twice and the second time, I laughed at the cost of the film. so I guess it's worth something for that. and also for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first visit. as another critic has pointed out, this film is ridiculous in every sense of the word. Not a single original thought has entered this film (which makes the comment below on the originality of the principle that totally disturbs me). the film is nothing more than a long line of clich√©s that follow one another like a movie. these are certainly not the next clerks, it is certainly not original, and it is absolutely not "good, clean and fun". the film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting way). Looking around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except maybe the elderly, was completely bored or pained by this movie. During some particularly moving scenes, like the one where Nick hangs up his mother, the audience was cracking because it was so badly done. I even heard someone * groan * in the theater, which I had never witnessed before. It does not matter where you get the chance to see this film, be it in a film festival, in an independent theater or anywhere else. do yourself a favor, pass this movie with revenge. unless you are like me and you can not resist the possibility of seeing what could be the worst movie of all time.
