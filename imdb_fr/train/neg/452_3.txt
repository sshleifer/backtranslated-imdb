I watched this film for a project on love. please tell Nicolas Cage to know what it would be like to be his character, and then read the lines he says. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... my brother was nearby. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy ends included the nice boy who cares for sad and lonely mother. No closing, bad script, and insufficient extension of minor characters. Save yourself unless you are ready to laugh. The costumes were well done and the extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to do, but keep it more gender-specific, I can not recommend it to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual movie. This is not a girls movie. It's not a strict romantic. And I can not show children because of sex and questions to follow. Overall, it's not a good movie.
