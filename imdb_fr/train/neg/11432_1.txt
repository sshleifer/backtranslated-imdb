I watched this movie yesterday and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to wear this incredibly incredible scenario for five hours (or whatever the journey time). From the beginning, every element of this movie is amazing. This film made me laugh a few times, but they were mostly shocked that the director / screenwriter really expected us to believe in the many scattered and messy elements that tried to reconstruct this film. <br /> <br /> The main objective of the film is Gray (Graham) and his intimacy issues. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother suddenly have too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something credible and acceptable, the director continues to invite Gray into these ridiculous twists that never really make sense. As an LGBT individual, this film seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we are going through in the exit process. (I'll be insulted if the writer's fag.) If there had not been the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which was otherwise understandably forced), I would have given him 3 negative stars .
