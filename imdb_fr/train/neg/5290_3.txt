I'm not usually one to project a movie. I try to see the positives and not focus on the negatives, but in this case, there are almost no positives. In my opinion, if you want to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film is taking pictures of Anne's face as she breathes deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden actors. Rupert Penry Jones is without expression. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern manners. Anne is described as being soft and erased, which is fine at first, but she stays the same throughout the movie, and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall, the production has no sense of the period, with too many errors to neglect, such as missing concert, kissing in the street, running in the street without a hat (why this scene in the film ?)? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.). In summary, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
