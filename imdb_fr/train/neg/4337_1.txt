This is just a butchery of a wonderful story of Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the scenario of the book. And, there are so many inconsistencies in the original film that one has to wonder if the screenwriter has even seen the first film. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and always the best Carlito) comes out of jail at the beginning of the original. Here, Carlito is retiring with his wife to heaven. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this article, she is not mentioned and Carlito retires with and will probably marry another girl. <br /> <br /> In addition, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like the way Mr. Guzman plays a totally different character in this film. He was Pachanga at the time of Pacino. This is now Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book for a long time, but where does the character of Sean Comb come from? Moreover, I think this film really passes on the racial tensions in Harlem on which Torres wrote. And, the crowd does not get the treatment they did in the book. They are also annihilated in this movie. As if by magic, the group of Pleasant Avenue is present for the second film. <br /> <br /> The book tells a beautiful story. This film could have told a beautiful story. This is just a huge disappointment. Read the book. It's a better use of your time.
