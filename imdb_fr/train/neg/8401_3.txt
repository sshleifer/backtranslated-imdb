Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It is obvious that, if the stooges are stars, they do not really direct the series. First, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagabonds. So there is not a lot of complete teamwork. The story of love that feeds the plot is irrelevant, the two ladies are the only ones to have an actress capacity, there is another group of musical folks who are not funny, unless you consider their attempts to be funny like jesters. The music is tiring, they drive cars to the ranch, then depend on the horses, the western style is stupid, and there is a lot of film without camouflage. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first shot, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears very early in an uncredited role. I loved everything these guys did, including all the stuff other than Curley, but this little dog is pretty bad.
