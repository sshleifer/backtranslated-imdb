Every Christmas Eve, I put my children to a new representation of It's A Wonderful Life. I also loved Bad Santa. So prosecute me. I admit it. I like nerdy movies, schmaltzy. I like the excellent ones, the smart guys too, but like many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual ka-ching ka-ching cinema of Santa Claus in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will never forget Bedford Falls, but I do not think a Christmas movie should become iconic for success. "Fred" is a perfectly correct holiday movie, with enough humor for adults and enough charm for kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, though most of the humor was obvious and that Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first class Santa, which helped a lot. This is not a great movie and it is unlikely that it will become a must for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and my daughter and I took advantage of what it was, a holiday schmaltz with a hint of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
