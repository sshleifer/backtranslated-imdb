This video contains an unwise way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a shame that those who did believe that the American people are so stupid to believe it, maybe as an American citizen, everyone must protest against this kind of shit. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies to manipulate and associate elements that are not even linked. The music used at times prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what is going on there. They use images that are misplaced in relation to their original content. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to reflect ... Do not you think you can do the same movie with all the religions of the world? world?
