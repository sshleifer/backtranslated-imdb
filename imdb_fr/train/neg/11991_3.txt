- Bad Stuff: This movie is a real shit. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake that I thought it was "The Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are almost useless. Part of the film, he thinks, getting his anger out of the window will improve his life. I want to know the casting director and if he was good because the acting, even adults, was horrible. A scene of kisses in this film is even nil. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I do not strongly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good deal: I do not really know what I can say. There are elements of suspense that move you forward, but they are quickly defeated by the bad work of cascading and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: do not look.
