This is perhaps the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing of theater - almost every shot and every moment sounds wrong. I will say, however, that it is almost serious enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can not for life to understand what it means (conceptually) by opening the film with an outside of the theater where plays "A Chorus Line". Should we think that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line", which contains stories about people who audition? Oh no, the show is collapsing on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do that?
