Well photographed and skillfully interpreted, in general, but the writing is very rudimentary. There are scenes of such incredible that there is no joy to watch. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so artificial that I groaned. And the "emotion-bulb connection" also seems very complicated. <br /> <br /> I do not know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and want to relax with something nice to watch with some flaccid comic scenes, this is a great movie. No major effort on the part of the viewer required. But the Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is generally much better than that.
