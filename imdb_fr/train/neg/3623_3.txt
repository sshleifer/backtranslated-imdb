(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was a display feature, co-billed with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Hispanic-Italian co-production in which a series of village women are murdered at about the same time as a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback, accompanied by his dog "man-eater" behind him . <br /> <br /> The inhabitants already suspect that he is behind all this and want his castle burned. The killings began when the older brother of Count Yanos, Count Igor Dalmar, was horribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Next, a woman, Ivanna (Erna Schuer), hired by Igor before her death him in his shows shows. Yanos agrees to hire him instead of his brother and together they look for formulas for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred body back to life. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women of the village. We see his grilled face appear at various times in the film. So we know he's still alive, which seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor faces another end in igniting a fight with Yanos about Ivanna, with lit candles falling on the same bed as Igor stumbling, bumping into a last and last sharp end. <br /> The Retromedia DVD is from a VHS source and looks pretty gritty and bad. Apart from an even more scary trailer, no other extras are included. Although it has a beautiful spooky Spanish castle and good atmospheres, I found it quite boring and predictable, without excitement or mystery, either. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
