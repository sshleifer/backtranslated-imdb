This can be one of the most enjoyable movies of all time if you do not take it seriously. It's a little outdated and the effects are lame, but it's so nice. There are giant crabs attacking a girl. Oh, and crabs sing Japanese. It's incredibly bad. And the end, which has been telegraphed throughout the film, is dreadfully terrible. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will let you roll for you. Do not even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she seems naked. Her daughter is not worth supporting, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. It's a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Did I mention that there were giant crabs?
