Bob Clampett's "Porky's Poor Fish" is a pretty cool comic strip full of dreadful word games and one or two nice moments. Located in Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard Porky black and white cartoon and one of the popular Merrie Melodies books-come-to-life. Like many of Porky's early cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather scalded musical debut issue and the film's climax. For the rest of the time, the star is a skinny cat who sees the fish market as an opportunity for a free meal, but has more than he had planned. Unfortunately, the public receives much less than they expected. As was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, projectors are punched, which could have worked just as well on a non-animated medium. Laughs are rare and, although the cartoon is almost saved by Clampett's energetic leadership, there is very little to recommend at all "Porky's Poor Fish" compared to other Porky cartoons.
