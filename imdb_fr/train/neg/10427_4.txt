Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you dissatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) can be described as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she has sex with men. She is still exploring, trying to find "more data" to see what she wants from life and the men in it, although it seems that at her age she should have a pretty good idea now. (However, I do not agree with those who say that Young is too old for the role, if so, we should all age as well.) For the most part, this film left me cold, well that it is not the worst. of this type, you will never see. And unlike the recent "Eyes Wide Shut", at least something is happening in this one.
