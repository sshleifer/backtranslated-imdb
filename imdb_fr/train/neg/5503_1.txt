I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you right now is that there is NO comparison. This movie was totally ridiculous with a living flying suit. A Martian who has taken different forms. Special effects that looked like something a little kid would create. In contrast, in the original, the characters were developed and viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight of this movie, actually, there was one, came when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end. He wore dark glasses and referred to life on this planet for 30 years as a sort of tribute to the TV series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
