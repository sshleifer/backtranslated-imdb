Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") is a modern, crime-obsessed teenager who is trying to solve the brutal murder of a young girl from the region. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this film, which is not particularly well done, but yet has a surprisingly serious about his main character. Silverstone seduced and managed to recruit an interesting young woman here, despite the fact that the photo was undermined. The support cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence of the last act is exaggerated. This is not a cheese camp party, but nothing exceptionally memorable. * 1/2 of ****
