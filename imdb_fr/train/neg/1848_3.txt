There are bad movies, then there are so bad movies, that they become almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still in shock, you know, looking in the air and drooling! You can say that the people involved (I hope they changed their name to protect themselves) were enjoying themselves a lot, and they were certainly not shy. I give this one a third out of ten just because of the free charcoal and REALLY bad effects. I laughed a lot for most of the movie, so I guess you could say it made me have a good time. Attention spectator, the words above do not in any way interpret that it is about a good film, because it is not the case. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to miss a movie with such a big title!
