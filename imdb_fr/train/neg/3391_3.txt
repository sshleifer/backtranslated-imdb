I wonder who, how, and most importantly, why have you decided to call Richard Attenborough to lead the most unusual sensation that has hit Broadway for many years? He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won for Gandhi you moron! Jeremy Irons is an actor of the Academy. Do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh what a beautiful war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of energy has survived the cumbersome procedures. Each character danced beautifully, he was charming but his projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw him on stage, I felt everything. The film should have been interpreted by unknown stars, newcomers but stars with fascinating and unforgettable faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was inside. True, I forgot that I'm absolutely wrong and that you're absolutely right Nothing like a Richard Attenborough musical Michael Douglas.
