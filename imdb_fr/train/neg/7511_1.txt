It was one of the most ridiculous and less well directed movies I've seen in a long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought to try this one: bad mistake. The film is supposed to show how the murders perpetrated in the real life of Son of Sam affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; What really acted was around the most boring characters that I doubt they care about their drug, marriage, etc. problems. The scenes that describe the murders are just that and nothing more; a shoot and then it's back to Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to appear in the movie: Spike, believe me, you're not Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, it makes them worse. The stupidest scene was to be the dog speaking in a clumsy voice, which was described in a scene in front of him where he would have been shot ??? Spike, what were you thinking about when you made this movie? I do not think at all. People who think they are seeing a criminal drama, follow my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser. In this case, you'd better watch Jerry Springer! Movie Waste, I gave it a 1 in 10: horrible miss.
