First, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then, get some amateur actors. It will be good for the hype of the festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years perfecting their craft? Then hire a director of photography who can not light. You see, if it's well lit, it will not look "real" and festival-goers will not like it. Who needs to have a professional level photograph anyway? Then hire a 10-year-old who has never had a camera to act as an operator. This will give your movie that totally amateurish feel that festivalgoers will take for "reality" and will guarantee that even if you are going to empty the seats of real people, critics and a small part of the audience who over-express themselves they will not believe that it was just a complete amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you're done, buy your ticket for the Festival of Bad Movies, says Sundance. <br /> <br /> sad waste.
