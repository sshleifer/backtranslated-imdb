No, this fairy tale with the pumpkin trainer, the godmother and the glass slippers does nothing, but if I had to elaborate, I should spoil it for you, which I will not do. But do not let curiosity take over you, because this film is not fantastic. It's one of those films that begins in a promising way, before betraying its audience with inexpensive panic tactics and an incoherent scenario. And it's a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a renowned plastic surgeon, while the other is your devoted, obedient and beautiful teenager. Their relationship is like the hand in the glove, so close that you would consider them more like brothers and sisters than as a parent. But things start to go wrong (not always) when Hyun-soo's friends, who Yoon-hee has operated on, start to get angry. <br /> <br /> It may be a warning to the public, and to Korean women who do not let their eyes fall when they pass under the knife, according to reports. The only really scary moments are those of plastic surgery scenes, although, in a way, I thought Kim Ki-duk's time was actually more gore when he described and described what was going on during the day. surgery itself. <br /> two halves, the fist being an attempt to shock the public with standard warning tactics, which, I admit, was coming to me from time to time. However, the second half has degenerated the movie into a stupid melodramatic one, and has been artificial enough to impose its ideas in the throat. Some things start to make no sense, and although attempts are always made to explain, you probably will not buy it, but horror movies are not logical to begin with. <br /> <br /> The main roles are all beautiful and there is a flagrant lack of male presence in addition to the negligible role of the police officer. But hey, I'm not complaining, even though the scenario could have been improved considerably. I recommend you watch this, only if you are a poor Korean horror fan, on VCD. Beware of these unusual moments!
