After watching some of the great things of HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I must say that I had high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Jeez. Often, the screenplay seems to have been written by an 8-year-old girl, some parts are horribly filmed (scene in which she "saves" Bill, I mean, go! She throws a chain at the guy and it's okay! embarrassing if you want my opinion, or a few moments before this scene, when she discovers that the couple left with Bill, ridiculous She hears them plan their business, and like 5 seconds later, magic The 3 of them are gone, and without struggle neither noise nor anything! <br /> <br /> I mean that the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires coexisting with humans in our modern society ... but honestly , I do not think they really wanted to do more than just a soap show, that an average teenager is watching all the time but nobody cares ... Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, at better mediocre, shallow and extremely predictable I often thought it was a joke or something. <br /> <br /> The actors offer really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were a regular low-budget family television show (well, maybe that's what it is, if you take away the family part ). The only actor I thought was pretty good was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, given the extremely short and poorly written answers he had to say, "What do you ..." "May I tell you call from time to time ... ", I think he did well to bring out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role should have. Anna Paquin was fine too, but no more. But the guy, playing his brother though, he's horrible. The scene in which he is being arrested is simply a shame for modern television. The acting is bad, the construction site looks completely wrong, and the other two guys "Why is he stopped? Uh ... I do not know ..." It was pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that, in my opinion, has completely failed is the way in which they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They make us hear what people think and speak at the same time and that's wrong. Often, it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thinking was some sort of annoying radio channel, and when she approached them, she reached the right level of frequency and had to hear everything they thought. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are simply useless and this story of vampire sex tape was totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I wrote all those comments not because I thought the show was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I was expecting quality stuff. I did not think it was going to be like that. It's certainly not a good show though. At best mediocre.
