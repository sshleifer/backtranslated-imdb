Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. I remember spending whole nights in front of the PC screen, trying to escape this mansion and being really surprised when monsters arrived in a surprising way. Now, notice, I'm tired of movies "generated by computer games". I do not remember a single success in this new Hollywood genre, although some are fun enough to watch. And yet, I am a fan of the game that I could not resist. My reasoning was that if the movie had a plot that resembled that of the game, everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> Dude, it was 90 minutes (which seemed to be 300) of my life that I will never come back. If I had this chance, I would have gladly moved to rearrange my sock drawer instead. It's not even in the category "so bad that it's funny". You could think that even Christian Slater had a little more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the main role of this chick is to create a sex scene - which I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) -, I saw more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy as such. Do not waste your time introducing yourself to it. The credibility of the story is below "I did not sleep with Miss Lewinski". The game of actors is only a few notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, is one of the worst movies I've seen and I recommend more than this one. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend the video game. He has much better story, actor and many more thrills. Regarding the film, here is a spoiler: it stings! Wait for the porn version.
