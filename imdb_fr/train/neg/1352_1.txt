Eytan Fox, who generally relied on the apologetic side of Israeli politics, has already made several very interesting films, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply magnificent film, "Yossi & Jagger". In "The Bubble", however, he pushed this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving an ovation to this film, the people at the screening I attended quietly stood up and left. I also left quietly, furious with anger at such a ridiculous, one-sided film, which translates self-preservation as racist intimidation and racist intimidation (and terrorism) into explosions of justified anger; which implies that the evil Israelis do so much harm to the Arabs that they react angrily to a steady stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and that they should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worth the price I had paid for the ticket (I was thinking of claiming my money back), and was essentially an Israeli monkey from the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then watch this movie because it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was directed by an Israeli director and, even worse, by such a talented Israeli director, is a shameful disgrace. Indeed, how surprised Israel can be to be considered a pariah state when the Israelis themselves make an anti-Israeli propaganda, a beggar belief. <br /> <br /> What a shameful and horrible film!
