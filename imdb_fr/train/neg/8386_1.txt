Tearing this movie is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. I will challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First of all, I am impressed by the special effects. It really seemed that the head of Marlon Wayans was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted a minute. <br /> <br /> Second, I loved the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an enervating restaurant singer and his renditions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, by coincidence, embodied Grier's father in Boomerang in 1992 (if you remember, he "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. It was so amusing. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How stupid is the doctor still not able to say that he is a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He has all his teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it is not a baby? Little Man is so mean that there is a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to lose $ 8 on this movie, do me at least one favor and do not take your kids. This film is far too sexual for little kids (a lot of jokes and clues about sex, raids, restaurant meals, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to school. projection that I was forced to bear. If you insist on seeing a silly movie, at least save your children from pain and suffering.
