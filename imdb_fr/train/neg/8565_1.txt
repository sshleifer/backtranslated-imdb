Sorry. Someone has to say it. This is really / was a dull movie. Worthy perhaps, but nevertheless boring. I almost cried out of trouble looking at her. The acting is quite disastrous, the story is long and predictable, the score and the work of the camera are totally standard and without excitement. It's one of those movies you're not allowed to hate (because it's about people with disabilities) but I hate it, I guess almost everyone likes it. It is interesting to note that critics have been so nice with this movie. I guess they do not have the right to be objective either. This was done to earn rewards - which I remember well. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining. I did not see the room, so I can not compare.
