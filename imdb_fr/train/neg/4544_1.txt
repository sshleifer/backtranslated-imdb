This movie is just not worth your time. His confidence in New Age mysticism is his only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> I was only encouraged to spend the time necessary to put a comment in perspective when I noticed that some have tried to strengthen the reputation of this company. drivel. Their motivation and objectivity are doubtful, as they encourage you not to look at the faults of the movies, but at his well-meaning message of New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> So would it be acceptable for some twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists to pay positive reviews on films / television that support their views? In spite of the bad qualities of the production or the lack of truth in one of its supposed historical bases? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will come right behind me to say things flowery about this movie, despite the truth.
