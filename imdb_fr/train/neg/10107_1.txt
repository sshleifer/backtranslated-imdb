Last week-end, I bought this "zombie movie" in the trash and watched it with friends who thought it would be a budget version of "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It looks like they've spent a good part of their budget on cover-art, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We watched the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with a yuppie who is in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone. In fact, they talk to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I could no longer suspend my disbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people actually consider this movie to be "so bad, it's good", they are liars. I have not finished the film, but one of the other critics mentions that they become somehow police officers at the end of the film, which makes me happy not to have watched until the end. <br /> <br /> It's even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT WATCH!
