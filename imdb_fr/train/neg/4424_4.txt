Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time, it shows the dark side. I bet your last dollar will have an unfortunate end! But why? With less than half a dozen exceptional exceptions, ALL homosexual films must end in death or an "addio" finale. It's like all the European films of Black Film from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The main ... a man or a woman must die or disappear alone in oblivion. Why, in the name of God, do writers, directors and producers have to make the public leave the theater feeling depressed? After all, it's supposed to be gay ... not morose. Maybe the category should be changed to a "morose" movie. A large percentage of homosexual sex is finally done and couples leave together at sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the disadvantages of gay life and gives a false impression of the gay way of life. This film just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here is another "gay" movie! It's wrong!
