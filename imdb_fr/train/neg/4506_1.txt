American filmmakers have decided to make a film that they think is Japanese. The characters are all poorly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the decor is inexpensive, unreal and certainly does not represent Kyoto in the early twenties and thirties. Those who have read the book already understand that the writers have not added any additional value to differentiate the movie from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot with some gaffes. Rob Marshall uses for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who had already joined the crouching tiger dragon. Marshall probably saw a Chinese film and represents Japanese culture. Seeing again these two actors makes even more ridiculous movies. The last scene of Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than this one.
