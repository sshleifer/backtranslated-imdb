It's the biggest pile of shit I've ever watched. DO NOT RENT! The directors of this film should be a group of never having made another film. It starts with a scenario and then disappears quickly. I think I'd rather watch dry painting than look at the blanket. The actors were awful, the plot faded quickly, filming left a lot to do. Not a good thing to say about this shitty movie. If you rent this movie, you will lose your money. I really enjoy the films of Lampoon National, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to play, learn to produce and learn to lead. I think I should continue these setbacks that made this movie for wasting money on rental costs and wasted time.
