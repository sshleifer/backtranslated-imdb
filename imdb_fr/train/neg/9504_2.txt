The only reason I watched this movie was because I recently read Robert Hough's fictional story, which was far from perfect, but interesting, about the life of the trainer, Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, under an unflattering light. <br /> <br /> I did not realize before watching the movie later on IMDb that it was originally a series. Whoever edited the original playback time of 233 minutes to the 68-minute version available on DVD did a lot of work. The abbreviated version plays as well as any other B movie of this period despite the many "duh-what?" moments. For example, are we really supposed to believe that our hero dug this 20ft deep tiger trap in a morning without even messing up his jodhpurs? Looking at the chapter titles, I see that number five is titled "Gorilla Warfare" and number eleven, "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the movie at all. I guess that's where some of the cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
