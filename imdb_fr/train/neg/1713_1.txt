If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you have not seen it. A contest such as "make your own horror movie in one day" could not result in an entry other than this scandal of an insult to the intelligence of any viewer. Mr. Sheets has forgotten a story, a plot, an appropriate dialogue, the fact that people need BASIC acting skills and that the recognized lighting designer has obviously forgotten to introduce himself. It seems that it is recorded on the biggest of the handycams and copied on a still worse equipment. The makeup effect consists of a black mascara for zombies and yoghurt poured over people's heads in order to simulate the melting of their skin. It's nothing more than a movie at home, and a very bad one too. Only fun to watch for friends, family members and neighbors who were ready to show up for the shoot. I can not understand why this mockery of a product is listed in ALL serious movie magazines or on a website. I have wedding home movies that are much better and more interesting. A total loss of time, money and energy. The following of ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is a little bit the same.
