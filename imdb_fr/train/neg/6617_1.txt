Really shows that hype is not everything. Shows that reveal which Abhishek actor is and that he only gets movies because of his father and his wife. Amitabh is as always strong. Ajay Devgan is as always crappy and useless and the new guy is a joke. The main woman is such a mess of actors. Such a pathetic film of such a revered director and such a big industry. With the movies as such, I have decreased the amount of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has been doing very lame films for a while. It's time to have different actors. Hrithek someone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol. Any other leading woman is half naked and wants to be. Pffffft.
