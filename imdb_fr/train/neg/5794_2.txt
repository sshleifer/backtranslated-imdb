the Germans all stand out and are mowed down with a machine gun. good people never die unless it is for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes its laughable. (Where did the German soldiers go after they rolled the gas tank to the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And all this idea, hijack a train? How stupid! The Germans know where you are going, it's not like you can leave the track and go! Such a waste. I would prefer to hurt my head with a flat-bottomed hammer 10 times, then rest again. I mean, seriously, it felt like it had been done in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! Team A is more credible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Look at it only if you need to laugh. This film is to Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was to John Wayne.
