When this piece was first introduced by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something very different for the time. So, some people would have found it very scary and might have been impressed by the special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at this day's room, it does not seem to be so scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Would a train really be allowed to put a RED LIGHT in a dark tunnel? I do not think so ...... but if you look at this piece again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes through the red light! (Maybe it was like that at the time of the dickens)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the trail leading to the Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Surely there would have been a series of appropriate steps with handrails so that the flagman could get on or off the cuttings. (I can not help but notice things like this) <br /> <br /> I will not remove anything from the role of actor, Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave great performances . <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean, it was the ghost of the traveler, or what ??? Has anyone really understood this rather puzzling story ??? (and maybe I'm the only one who does not) ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ..... <br /> <br /> The room has a wonderful atmosphere throughout character. It suffers from not being so scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has unusual signage practices .... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
