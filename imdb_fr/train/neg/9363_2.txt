This film has fatal flaws, it is amazing to be able to go through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility. Then, this same person simply walks around the premises and enters the doctor's office. <br /> <br /> Film very very very predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how the film was shot, unless it was shot in Canada and probably received a grant from the government. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you're really bored and there's nothing else to watch on TV, then I would say it's going to waste a bit of time, but otherwise is a film that no actor would want on his CV.
