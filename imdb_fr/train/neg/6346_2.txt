This film stinks! You will want to recover the two hours and more it takes to get through. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda are trying to do much better. This film was intelligent, witty and well played. I was worried about what happened to the two Gwyenths - or rather the characters she played - and the performance of the secondary cast was fantastic. care less about one of these people - less of everything Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 o'clock - and she's so melodramatic that she's laughable, and not in the comical sense of the word. The second Melinda is fine, but she is forgotten. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because, I guess, he had spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. An anecdote for this film is that he wrote this scenario in two months: you can say it. And although Chloé Sévigny has talent - those around her are not, not enough to be present. The film ends up being Chloé Sévigny and a group of other people you know to have seen in other films but you can not remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
