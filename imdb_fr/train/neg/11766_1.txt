It's hard to know where this adaptation starts to go wrong, because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith understood that you did not read them for crime novels, but for his deeply condescending and completely false vision of an Africa that does not exist. He did for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successfully but so thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Once I understood that, I stopped complaining that Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, cast like Mma Ramotswe. If it must represent a land that is not Africa, how appropriate is it to be a black woman who is not African? She is not the only American to be part of the cast. Mma Makutsi is performed by Anika Noni Rose. The two women are far too young for their roles and much too glamorous. Both brutally murder local accents and focus so much on this brutality that they fail to offer much action. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is dynamic, cute and sweet. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying dog. <br /> <br /> The result is almost unassailable. The main distribution is bought only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who decently interprets the role of JLB Matekoni. He is smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for that - he is a bright light in an ocean of sucker. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly put at the feet of the butchers committee who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been a lot of fun, but notoriously bad. He refuses to be published. As a result, his books contain grammar experiments that approach the scientist and characters that change names in the middle of a sentence. It is therefore a feat that the editorial team of this project has really aggravated. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicized. The characters speak of "openness" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and MJLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi moans that she does not have a computer, but given her constantly updated hair, makeup, and jewelry, I'm surprised she does not have a MacBook in her purse with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> And then? Have we left with here? It's hard to be upset by this crap adaptation because, honestly, most of the things I like in the original books are anyway apocryphal. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute, non-threatening blacks that are filled with fun and attractive wisdom nuggets. It reads well despite the linguistic parody, but it is a vision of what was a certain type of whites like blacks. It's just not true. <br /> <br /> That said, it is not surprising that this show is as bad as ours. It remains to be seen if European and American audiences will even notice.
