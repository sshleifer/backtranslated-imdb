This film has received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. It must be understood that this film was never designed to be taken seriously. It is a camp that goes in the same direction as "the army of darkness". AoD was stupid, but funny and bad in a good way. "House of the Dead" is not a "good bad guy". <br /> <br /> There are qualities inherent to good camper movies, the most important of which is their credible fantasy. You have to believe what happens in a movie to see the humor when a situation is incredibly bad. Without borders, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks credibility. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same twists and reactions of characters that many horror movies inevitably begin to present. For example, too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love among gore and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I'm pursued by zombies, I want to go out with a sexy girl. Believe it? No? Then you probably will not believe it when the characters start to suck their faces in this movie. <br /> <br /> Beyond the obvious problems that undermine this film like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll has chosen to add scenes from the video game of zombies, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is this artistic choice not clearly justified, but it diverts attention from an already incredible plot. In addition, there are many examples of bad acting, and apparently no attempt by the director to guide the actors' reactions to the events ... leaving the film without any redeeming quality. To avoid...
