Hollywood, home of hype, glamor and profit-seeking, is barely governed by spiritual values. It is therefore not surprising that his attempts at inquiring into the spiritual life are lean and often stupid (it is better to go further) to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, for having probed the representations of Spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the ideas he tries to communicate. It seems that a figure of providence and salvation may correspond to Verne (Clark Gable with his most humble and selfish attitude) and Julie (Joan Crawford, scolding and spitting out all the words in order to become queen of the ladies Hard) seems ridiculous at best. Is it the Patron Saint of the Star System at work, who associates the ego at war before sending them to an additional penal servitude on the ground M-G-M? BUT. . There are good performances of support here, and striking moments: the barracks of the shady prison; the boat escaping in the moonlight or against a cloud of pictorial clouds; Julie walking along the seashore as the wind rose; Julie and Mr. Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate for the freedom of Verne as the storm prepares; an exceptionally ennobling gay prison novel between two convicts. . There is above all a dignified and detached performance of Paul Lukas in the role of Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambreau, but who turns his back on him. At the most memorable moment of the film, Hessler, who left Cambreau, stands outside the cabin. We hear the wind in the jungle, see the shadows on his face, which translate a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he goes out in the night. At this moment, Hessler realizes an ambiguity, depth and existential force that no other character can achieve. is the film's secret that his deepest sympathies are allied to Hessler?
