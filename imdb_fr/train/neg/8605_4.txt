This is a pretty interesting festival of the late 80s, featuring ugly slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can overcome the ridiculousness of all this, you could derive a minor pleasure. The acting is dreadful and the plot is just there to keep the movie together between two bloody attacks, but the movie is not a total waste of time. The special effects are actually quite good and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the Blob remake, probably because of its leanness. In all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I would not suggest seeing this movie unless you have a strong stomach and you are interested in that kind of thing.
