One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was so bored that I turned it off halfway to watch the news. When I turned it back on, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are still some dreams in between. Come on, what's supposed to interest me? A film must have a reason to be interesting. As soon as you feel that the movie is just a dream, it's all sensible viewer who goes out. Has anyone ever insisted on telling you his dreams and what it meant to them? That's it !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
