My complaints here concern the rhythm of the film and the material available. Although the use of films and archival letters gives the film a new and interesting perspective, all too often the material to be promoted is simply not very interesting (as when Goebbels complains about this or that disease, etc., or ad nauseam sequences from his small German hometown). In addition, the film crawls in the cover c. 1920-1939, then goes through the years of war. In short, the film is not much better than a documentary from History Channel, except that the filmmaker has a slightly higher sensitivity than your average documentary publisher in History Channel and can therefore more cleverly arrange details of Goebbels' life. Yet, I found that missing.
