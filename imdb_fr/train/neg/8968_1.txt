The writing on the screen is so stupid that it hurts me to have lost two hours of my life that I will never find (where did I hear that before). The acting is mediocre. Things change often enough to allow you to watch and wait for something horrible to happen. Nevertheless, there is not one original thing in this film. While the first Cube was a nasty horror movie, which did not make much sense, the Zero Cube took it back and tries to tell exactly the same story, except this time, it makes a heinous point of try to give explanations to the spoon for every detail to which the first film did not respond. The funny thing is that the director recycles the exact scenes from the first movie that were a bit odd and tries to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no consistency. This script is so useless. I imagine it was written by a half-spirit of 15 years with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is at the end, they paralyze the "good" wunderkind guy, and he becomes the retarded boy of the first movie, and you see him when they find him ("this piece is green ..") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a twist. First of all, what if you did not see the first movie, it makes no sense, says your director. Oh, another good idea: instead of identifying the x, y, z coordinates of the piece instead of the numbers (cube 1997), this time it's 3 letters, each giving one of 26 values ​​of possible coordinates. Duh. Except now, permutations do not make much sense anymore. So he let the letters disappear before anyone could use them. I want to get my money back. <br /> <br /> I guess I had to write this because there are so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / writers should be required to possess talent.
