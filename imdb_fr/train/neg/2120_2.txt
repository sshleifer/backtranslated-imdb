I considered myself rather melancholy, especially when I watched great touching and heart-wrenching movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it is also really surprising to see how many people have praised this film. <br /> <br /> There are several troubling facts about the movies: 1. Despite the guilt Ben's real intention of saving 7 lives to save his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this type of suicidal action. Some people may perceive that it is a heroic action and others think that it behaves cowardly. In the end, it was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot of the film is too dramatized, but the logic is too simplistic. Medically, the pairing of blood groups is mandatory to be an organ donor. Towards the end of the film, we learned that Emily had a back blood group that limited her chances of getting the donor in a short period of time. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood group, the same as his own which allowed him to be his donor and, despite the scarcity of his blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also its kidney, cornea and bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only the corresponding blood group, but also a tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organ donation, despite the jellyfish venom with which he killed himself? <br /> <br /> I may be over-analyzing the whole story, because after all, it's just a movie. However, we hope that some troubling facts described above will help you reconsider your plan to see this movie. If you opt for a soap opera, go for it. But if you're looking for smart entertainment, do not miss this one!
