The world may have ended. Unfortunately, this film survived as further evidence of Canada's inability to make films that go beyond the execrable. Maybe it's because all of our very good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's a pity that Short was not shot in this pretentious and banal movie. He could have given him some credibility. The Canadian government should realize - and this film is a great example - that putting money into the pit does not give a good cinema. If people using these public funds had to compete, they might have been forced to offer something worthwhile. As it was, they produced another sneering embarrassment.
