Wow, I'm a big fan of the Henry VIII / Tudor era and, well, it was ... interesting. The only one I looked at was Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I had already played badly before, but it reached new heights. When was the actress playing Catherine crying? she moaned and screamed and I must admit that I rewound many times ... many times ... funny and funny things. The only person who even showed a little talent was the actress who plays Anne Boleyn (I may be harmed, I have a slight obsession for Anne Boleyn, she was really a fascinating woman, read it, it's worth it!) Moreover, I read a lot about the Tudor period and I think that the characters were not displayed very precisely, they were all very stereotyped. Watch this film only if you are ready to live a very important time and the important life of the people involved has become a laughing stock.
