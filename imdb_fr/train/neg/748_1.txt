I love movies and I will watch any movie, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie that I can not watch all the way through. The acting is terribly bland and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek who did it in the basement of his mother with minimalist software, and ..... the long scenes of just. .. walk !!!! And this film is THREE HOURS !!! I did not even take 15 minutes before quickly sending the DVD. The scenes with the extraterrestrials are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "war of the worlds", let's call this "war of long distances". It cost $ 5 million! What do they spend money on, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but, on a positive note, you have to watch a scene when the extraterrestrials start killing people. It's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they squirm again for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you're a fan of boring, obsolete movies and no action, here's one for your DVD collection. But I did not write it for you, I wrote for billions and billions of other people who will hate this movie. It's not worth your time nor your money <br /> <br /> I know it's true, but the book is not that long, and I'm a complete book worm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why ? Just get Steven Spielberg's version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than that !! <br /> <br /> I give this a fat, zero fat out of 10.
