"I am curious: Yellow" is a smoking pile laughable and pretentious. Regardless of political opinions, this film can not be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that's not true. I saw R-rated movies with male nudity. Admittedly, they only offer a few ephemeral views, but where are the R-rated movies with gaping vulvas and movable lips? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for these crappy cable shows: schlongs swaying in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And these pretentious independent films like The Brown Bunny, in which we are presented the thrilling site of Johnson Gallo, but not a trace of visible pink on Chloe Sevigny. Before weeping (or implying) "double standards" in nudity, the mental obtuse must take into account an inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no exposed genitals when actresses appear naked, and one can not say the same for a man. In fact, in an American film, the female genitals are generally absent from pornography or explicit eroticism. This so-called double standard is less of a double standard than a depressing ability to culturally accept the inside of women's bodies.
