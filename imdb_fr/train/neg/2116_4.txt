The horror images of Poverty Row from the 30s and 40s depress me terribly. God knows I do not have anything against low-budget films, but the ones that were produced at that time look so sad and shabby - and, in the final analysis, they're just not that good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is slightly more entertaining than the low-barrel dreck like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, far beyond his climax "Dracula", still plays another mad doctor; the unsustainable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a questionable young journalist (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also present, which could delight fans of hardcore movies of the 30s and 40s.
