What I learned from "The List". <br /> <br /> A decent filmmaker, a sexy girl capable of starring and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster will not give you your money. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really ?!", Malcom McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs theater classes. <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punished me by charging me $ 5.50 to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> movie, you do not need an end. Just leave everything unexplained, unresolved, uninteresting enough for the public to fall asleep before the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random owner can heal death simply by making a cross on a window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can revive you. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs theater classes. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> Apologies will not be accepted.
