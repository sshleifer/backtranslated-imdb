Normally, I would never rent a movie like this because you know it will be bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I discovered that the guy from the video library gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare, I found this film lame. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot is meaningless. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really was. At the end of the movie, you have more questions, then answers. <br /> <br /> On 'The scale of maximum power from 1 to 10', I give a note to this film: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the criticism of Corinthian (just in below mine). He says Robert Englund is tearing lingerie, riding, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer and not by Robert Englund.
