Saint freaking God all-freaking-powerful. This movie was so bad, I thought I was drugging. In the wrong way ... The character who plays is the poorest thing I've seen for a long time. This movie was more like Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie seemed to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the car, and you can tell there is no horse. They flee extraterrestrial monsters and have about the same speed as a fast jog. Then he goes to a distant shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And CG in general seems to be in the same mood at Beyond the Mind's Eye in 1992. I mean, come on, really. It looked like a horrible episode of Hercules without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. Worst. Movie. Already.
