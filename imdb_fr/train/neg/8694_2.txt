The female lead was a terrible actress who made the film mediocre. She smiled too much when she came to the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have caused the police to suspect her. I would have been inconsolable in the same situation. She seemed very calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the role better. And that would have brought in a lot more money for such a controversial and important subject. Everyone was excellent. I do not know where the main actress is, but I hope she will have drama lessons.
