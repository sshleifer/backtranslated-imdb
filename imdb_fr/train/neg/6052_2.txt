Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," episode of season 1 of John Carpenter in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like an inexpensive cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and the time constraints. With "Pro-Life", however, budget and time constraints clearly show more than anything else. As always, Carpenter's management is solid, but the writing and production itself have a quality that gives the impression that it was done in a hurry. The script is not always clear, the message is blurry, and the story is full of holes in the plot once you get back to it. Maybe if Carpenter had rewritten the script, it could have been an episode that was worth it. Instead, it's a mess that only Carpenter enthusiasts will find the least pleasure. Without a doubt the worst Carpenter of all time. 2/10
