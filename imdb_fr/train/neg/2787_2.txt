In figures, singer Kid (Prince) is about to become a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father beating his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three great songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", " Let's Get Crazy "and" When Doves Cry ". The concert scenes in this movie are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is only a VERY small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is glaring and has already been done many times - and it's much better. Secondary intrigues are, to put it mildly, poorly managed. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and so tired that I became really insulted. His wife beating the father is necessary for the story, but the scenes are so badly managed (in acting and staging) that I could not believe it. The scenario is terrible - lousy dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And there's tons of misogyny here - the Kid's mother gets beaten; The boy strikes Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia undresses and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. In addition, the characters of Williams and Princes constantly treat women horribly. <br /> <br /> The acting game is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the worst actor I have ever seen. His empty face and his wooden dialogues are so terrible that I could not believe it. This film comes alive only during concert scenes, but there are not many. The "dramatic" scenes are so badly interpreted and manipulated that they make this film a chore to accomplish. They should have just made it a concert movie. I give a 2 - only for music.
