Vovochka is your daily film against authority and the hooligan. Vovochka, the main character, has been described as a bad influence on neighborhood children. With the words of wisdom from an adult couple he meets along the way, he finds it difficult, but worthy to do, to change his mischievous ways. Personally, I found the actor who played Vovochka too boring to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the film would allow most to feel the emotional struggle that Vovochka has when he wants to be good but that bad things happen. This fight makes the film a little different from other films of the same genre, it is the little flavor that I wanted to say. Overall, this movie did not really interest me, even though it was most likely intended for a younger audience.
