Once upon a time there was a sci-fi writer named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy" about a man discovering a race of cute little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to plunder his grave before his corpse became cold. This is the book where they got the idea of ​​Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a flagrant scam of "Little Fuzzy", I wonder why I'm the only one to have noticed it? <br /> But do not trust me. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a free copy of "Little Fuzzy": http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
