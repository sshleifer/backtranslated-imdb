A resurrected wrapped monster is the victim of a murderous frenzy. A lunatic seeks revenge for the living limbs of a previous expedition. Universal seems to lack packaging and new ideas. Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr. playing Kharis, the mummy. <br /> <br /> Other players are George Zucco, Wallace Ford, Turhan Bey, Dick Foran and Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> How long can this madness continue?
