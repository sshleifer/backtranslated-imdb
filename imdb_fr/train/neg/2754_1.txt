My original review of this movie was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times. Although this is a very precise criticism, I thought that my criticism should be a little more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I will start with the main actress; her facial expression does not change once in this film, she does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills allow her to look at her eyes to the left and right and to feel like she does not know Jack. It's an emotionless ball that I suppose has too much botox. His lack of facial expression throughout the film is however overtaken by the deplorable love affair with the main actor who seems to emerge from nowhere and who makes them walk on a beach and fall in love just hours after their meet. The main actor, whose hair needs more attention than he asked for, was at best mediocre and did not make me feel once that he was really at risk. <br /> <br /> The only thing that surpasses the hideous actor is achievement, intrigue and inaccuracy. I saw some stamp ads with more structure than this movie. There is no development in the character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would do. <br /> <br /> This film would not have been so bad if it had been deliberately miserable. Snakes on a plane, but I was doing so much effort that I could not even laugh. I think I now have a brain tumor after watching this film and thinking about all the ways in which I could have used this budget and coordinating team to create something much better. If I bought this DVD, I would break it in pieces, burn it, then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
