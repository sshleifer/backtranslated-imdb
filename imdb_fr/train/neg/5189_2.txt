This series would have been much better if they had just done one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. The Diamond Head character needs someone who can handle the role of this adorable thief, which McShane has proven he can do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the real Diamond Head, is really only a little bit in the role. McShane is not really as good as the mean Tree. Tso-Tsing, the character of France Nuyen, can not decide if she is the unfortunate victim or the woman is hard and ready to fight. She really earned her salary in the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head lover. After watching an episode or two, I have nothing to do with what happened to anyone. Tree gives us many things to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to love him. Unfortunately, the kind of espionage in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960s.
