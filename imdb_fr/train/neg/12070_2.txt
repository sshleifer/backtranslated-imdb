It turns out that I bought one of these 50 collections of "Legacy of Horror" movie packages and if you think I'm still looking for a good HORROR movie. Sometimes you find a film as fun as a camper, like The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's big movies (some are not horror and are only there because Hitchcock realized horrors and suspense), but at other times it seems like they are putting films like The Island Monster and that on because they can not accept the fact that they would be easily forgotten and should be 'elsewhere. <br /> <br /> So we open ourselves to some kind of Westing game idea. The rich, but cruel and violent father, played by Carradine (the only standing character here) has died and bequeathed his legacy to his children and servants whom he still hates. Carradine gives a pretty good performance, as always, but it remains mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us sitting through mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast is either over-active or under-performed in the scenes. Since it was a film independent of the 70s, lighting and effects are quite limited. It is difficult to create a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what is happening in some scenes as well. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga make at least an effort and I am ashamed to admit that I let myself laugh at the end, mainly for its total stupidity, if not obvious enough that did it but not enough to improve the quality of the film. You are not supposed to like the characters, because they are either selfish, cruel, or psychotic, but that brings them to a whole new level and makes many unassailable. The scenes of death are rather bad and the suspense is not really there. This proves that you would probably enjoy the pack of 20 "Chilling" movies containing such films as House on Haunted Hill, Little Shop of Horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is best avoided.
