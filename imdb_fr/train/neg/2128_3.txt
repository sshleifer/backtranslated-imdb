No need to remake, and he can not almost capture the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few inducing yawns. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style and especially talent, not only for the acting, but for the staging, sets, costumes, etc. He has a flagrant disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member who shows all the talent, Tyne Daly is not that bad. They should have stayed quite alone. The songs are good (Vanessa Williams) to poor (all others). Look at the original version of 1963 and skip this one. There is not much to recommend here.
