This film has everything to please on television. Although it started with great intentions, featuring beautiful scenery, authentic accessories and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a horrible and cheesy dialogue on the nose, and rushed to the television playing melodramatically. The characters were so empty that I sometimes thought they were about to degenerate into a puddle of bilious mud, and the action was so complicated and badly cut that the soldiers stood in turn. The Germans were so devoid of realism that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officers have talked about is the wonder of the Americans. Please take my word for that. I'm a big fan of the war genre and this movie is shit. Nevertheless, this DVD has an excellent additional feature, covering the letters of the front lines of the First World War, which makes this rental a waste of time.
