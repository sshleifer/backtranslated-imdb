That the critics liked this film surprises me. The plot is a mess. The characters are in wood. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and judging all of them. Nobody has quality or point of interest. It's not an edgy job. It's not imaginative. It's not ironic. It's not smart. There is nothing simple in this tedious work. It is miss the theatrical release is not a surprise. That the "This network" is diffused diminishes this place. I highly recommend moving to a new Garden Smart show on PBS or even good information if you encounter this mess on TV late at night. If you meet him on TV, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not to have suffered from this disaster. Life is short. This film is long.
