I remember watching "Lost Missile" (actually, I had an attack attack until my brother and several cousins ​​of the house where I was an overnight guest have agreed to watch it with me - I was, from time to time, Eric Cartman of the 1960s - sorry, guys) and be a little embarrassed when the sustained wave of multi-stage heat emerged as a device for conspiracy - even as a second class, I knew that a simple missile simply could not carry energy around this heat or devastation for more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My infliction of this turkey on loving parents was a self-punishing crime. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (except for the Shatnerism of the actor who played the role of the governor's help that someone else mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​a missile facilitates the cooking on the surface of the Earth with the help of the heat of its exhaust ... No. <br /> <br /> How the people from "Mystery Science Theater 3000" missed "Missile Lost" anyway? <br /> <br /> This is a great classic of involuntary comedy. Look at it if you want to drink a glass of beer for a weekend.
