It's a very confusing film. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot was meaningless. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when a film is dubbed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was originally intended. This may be part of the problem, but I doubt that this can explain all the problems of this film. The dubbing is bad enough and the voices do not match the characters very well. The scenes are agitated, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do no more than baffle the viewer. What I liked in this film is the look of the werewolf himself and the scenes where he attacks. Now, if they could put everything in place and if they had made sense, they might have had something. Do not waste your time on this one.
