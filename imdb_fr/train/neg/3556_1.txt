You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes operates at half-speed instead of shooting hard in a movie, and "The Incubus" is the worst-case scenario of a worse actor in which a big actor makes the request to pay his bills. bills. . In fact, by observing Hammy's script and John Hough's "Baroque" artistic direction, it's hard to blame him. The film has something to do with a series of rape killings in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed up. In one way or another, the management succeeds in sucking up the tension and the interest of each scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly PO '. ed sometimes. The Incubus itself, which only appears until the last scene, is a well-made creation, but it is not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
