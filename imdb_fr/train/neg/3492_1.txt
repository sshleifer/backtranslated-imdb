I do not buy kung-fu movies for a plot. I buy them for fight scenes. We can forgive a bad plot for excellent fight scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but too slow for my taste. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes, lasting only a few minutes each. The last fight was a little longer, but at that moment, I was so bored that I did not even care.
