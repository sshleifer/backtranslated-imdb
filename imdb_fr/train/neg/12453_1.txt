I had always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when the Sci-Fi channel aired this film, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie whose name is only. She does not wear the correct costume [she must have refused or ordered major changes] and the plot unfolds as a James Bond of a poor man. Nothing that made the heroine of the comic strip a success, that is, her superhuman strength or determined will. bad dream. I do not even think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I will not waste your time on it.
