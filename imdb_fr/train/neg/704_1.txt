A beautiful romanticization of the sexual exploitation of black women in New Orleans by white men in power and privilege. Ooh. Does this whet your appetite? In this case, browse a DVD or videotape and admire this free course through a troubling historical segment. For good measure, it is adapted from the book by the famous pirate Anne Rice. The staging is as disgusting and melodramatic as the nerdy dialogue. Most actors are amateurs. The only asset of this production is that it has employed almost a dozen black actors, who have hardly ever been employed in the current market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt) (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It is also, despite himself, an excellent showcase for Nicole Lyn. James Earl Jones, pompous and heavy, is also present. Thus died Ossie Davis, a minimal talent that owes its success to being affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be rated "T" for tripe.
