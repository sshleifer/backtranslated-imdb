I totally agree with the other comment on the tiger movie Lily with this movie. <br /> <br /> This film must be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (with Brotherwood Wolves, 2 dreadful movies in a much too short period of time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the casting is really interesting and the original idea quite amusing. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my darlings, I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a mediocre film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is very bad, as usual, which proves that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> avoid this film, if you want to laugh, look rather an Alain Chabat or a beautiful piece of time full of pleasure, like THE GIRL OF ARTAGNAN.
