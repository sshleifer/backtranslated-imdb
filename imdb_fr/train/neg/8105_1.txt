It's hard, yes, but I call them as if I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80's. It was really one of the most dreadful and boring movies I ever made. watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. The Czech parameters are really beautiful. The political backdrop is attractive, but unlike similar "historical" stories (for example, Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), it has failed to make politics relevant or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes painful and slow. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started to hope that the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure if I read the book, the story would have made a little more sense. However, life is too short to devote more time to this one.
