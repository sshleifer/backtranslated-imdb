Not only was he always boring to listen to, but he was not joking. I swear that Asian fagots telling jokes to moms would have been more fun than Leary shit. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary said he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" .. apparently, he was always up on something; he was just a kind of foolish crack mainly related to drugs. One of his jokes was something like, "I would not use crack, especially if I have the same name as between my buttocks" - Oh man, how did he invent that one ?! I swear the only guy who has to close the door is Denis Leary. Thank God, I did not have to see it live. This guy totally fears. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused by swear words and "jokes" where you can come with yourself, waste your time with this junk.
