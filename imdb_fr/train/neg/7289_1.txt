It's a film of immense appeal for a relatively well-defined group (which I do not belong to). I went to see a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional Hungarian family (often downright "crooked") is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really offer its viewers something more in the end. In the end, such images speak of the human condition - this image brings almost no new light to any of its most significant facets.
