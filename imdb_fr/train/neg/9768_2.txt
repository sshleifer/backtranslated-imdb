When I first arrived in Happy Birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie had lasted. I was surprised by the length. Animated films and horror films share common ground: the attention of the selected audience, which should last about 90 minutes. Anything more, and you will lose most of your audience. <br /> <br /> Those 110 minutes, or 20 minutes after his climax, were a huge problem for me. I would like to say that half of this film could have been edited, but I would be too generous to say it. Go ahead, look at it and tell me how many scenes could have been mounted, even if you are not a major in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Whatever the visit, the film was mediocre. He spent all his time trying to be this huge mystery on which the "10 elites" kill the remaining friends. For the most part, not only do they do too much, but they zoom in on a face and say, "That's this guy! No, it's that girl!" You will spend more time with the camera misleading than watching the movie. And do not get me started in acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, that allowed me to start. At first, I had to laugh while trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson was playing the character who had become blind in Little House on the Prairie (later, research showed that my suspicions were true) because throughout this film, she really looked blind. Strange, as an established actress, she should have been the best of the group, but proved to be the worst. The rest of the staff, aside from Ann (Bregman), was pretty mean, but she had the cake. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of ten friends, and one of them is immediately killed. of. Almost no one thinks of the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue their happy way. Slowly, then more quickly, there are revelations about the main character of Virginia (Anderson), her past and her psychologist, who is a bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most psychologists. Meanwhile, more and more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that, just like the first "disappearance", the more the "best buttons" disappear, the less resting care is important. Of course, they give a few seconds of air time to say "Wow, (this person) just does not want to run away," etc., but then they resume their sexual behavior. And talking about that, it was probably because of the horrible scenario, or maybe it was me who lost interest at the 30 minute, but it was really hard to follow who liked who of the group because they seemed all of them being sexual partners of the next or someone would be panicked in front of the MAX by another and the best friends of the next scene. SEE: the scary guy who kept a mouse / rat in his pocket? Literally ?? and was the most obvious suspect. I give too much credit to the film (and time), but I will never know how he became a member of the "Elite 10". <br /> <br /> But I move away from the subject, there is a mystery. Why are these children targets? Why does Virginia think she killed someone, when it has never been proven (until the end) that one of them had been slain? And why would the trailer and the poster say that these murders are "Six of the weirdest murders you'll ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, most of them had been shown in one of the first two films on Friday 13. Coincidentally, Friday 13th Part 2 came out two weeks after Happy Birthday Day. They may be talking about when they filmed the movie several months ago, but they were late for the, well, party. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" will be revealed, trust me, you will have to go back 3 -4x to get laughable and inconsistent motives, and even then, put the subtitles to get all the words that mumble victim / killer. Even if you get the first time, it's an incredibly outrageous and hilarious finale. It's almost worth looking at the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday party should be avoided. This is a first horrific and illogical script project ?? please be aware that several rewrites are needed before the role of cameras, it contains either extreme or extreme actions, and it is totally unrealistic to see how people react under extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side note: When I was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (Still, oddly enough, guilty pleasures, but they get harder and harder to watch as the years go by.) We had our first VCR and I recorded as many horror movies on TV network (or EDITED VERSIONS). All I remember, Happy Birthday to me, is to record the last 10 minutes on tape, which made me very afraid ?? and of course revealed the great mystery about who the killer was. Even though I have seen other clips from this movie, I think it's the first time I've ever seen a feature film. Fortunately, this horrible film did not hurt me in my childhood. I'm older now and I can take this trash. But never again. <br /> <br /> Note 2: That said, this crazy song "Happy Birthday to me" played in the closing credits (and as a score all along) always scares me. I guess this movie (or the last few minutes) had an influence on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
