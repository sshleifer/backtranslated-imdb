Do not forget the name of Kevin Lime - and please, do not let him <br /> <br /> direct it again. Choice of the moment, the rhythm, the assembly: everything goes absolutely badly. <br /> <br /> Three or four honest professionals (next time, guys, get out of the set <br /> <br />) can not do anything to save this movie from fans like Alice <br /> > <br /> Evans and the production standards you expect <br /> <br /> children's programs produced by teenagers on British television. <br /> <br /> Greatest mystery: music. A partition so inept, inappropriate and <br /> poorly adapted to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is a case of sabotage. Add an apparently unmicro-engineered <br /> <br /> sound from a single pickup, and a developer who <br /> <br /> remembers only intermittently adding an off-screen hearing action, and we have to have what must be one of the best money ratios to the result of the last <br /> <br /> <br />.
