Wow! I am shocked to learn that the world is small and that we are all interconnected. What a loss of 88 minutes. John Dunne expressed it better in one sentence. "No man is an island." The acting was not bad. The children gave it all, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow it anymore and the only real "hero" of the movie ended up in prison after being tormented by a maid. I do not know. I just do not understand. Never mind.
