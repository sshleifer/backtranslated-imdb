I miss the words. This movie was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight, I really wish I did not do it. Although I tried to get through to the end of the credits, I must admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this film would require the last most impressive third in the history of film production to be able to give it a critique that is not vicious. <br /> <br /> Do not watch any part of this movie. .
