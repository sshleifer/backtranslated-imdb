It was almost unfathomable for me that this movie was a bust, but I was really disappointed. Knowing the cinema of Pekinpa for years, I found this DVD, considerably reduced, for sale and I thought it was worth it. The few opening credits, emblematic of the fans of Pekinpah, present an interference between the man and the animal, but here we have a nonsegetic environmental noise of children playing in a schoolyard during the laying of a bomb. Fantastic suspense. Then, when Caan and Duval go on their next mission, Duval drops the bomb on Cann that his appointment had an STD, found only by rummaging in his purse while Cann was intimate with her. The resulting laugh is fantastic and clearly pays tribute to Brian Depalma in Dressed to Kill, at the expense of Angle Dickenson's short run. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls flat. Even bring me Alfredo Garcia's head has a stronger production value, a bold call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah credits as additional conference material, but once they are done, turn off The Killer Elite.
