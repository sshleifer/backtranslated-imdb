Just when I thought I would end a whole year without giving a single movie a "bomb" rating, a friend brought that notorious shit to my house last night. I was worried the worst would be known, and it was as bad as I expected. It's a Mexican mess, dubbed in English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. He has terrible scenery and effects, and represents a rather scary Santa who does not operate at the North Pole, but rather from a cloud in space, and who does not have little elves who help to make his toys but rather all the different groups of children from virtually every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick laughs heartily at observing instructors showing all those hard-working kids singing horrible holiday songs in various languages, seems to drag on and tell no story. It's obvious that Santa Claus does not respect the laws on child labor! <br /> <br /> We finally have a devil's apprentice dressed in red, bright and slender, traveling from hell to earth, just to make naughty kids turn Santa's eve towers into a nightmare. Watching this film is a tripping and twisted experience, and it will scare away little children and keep them away forever from Santa Claus and holidays. Curiously, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which makes it even more frightening in the context of all the strange things that are happening. It easily makes my personal list of the "worst film I've ever seen," but I'm sure it's not nothing.
