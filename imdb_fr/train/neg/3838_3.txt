Terry West had a good idea with this movie. He just did not get through. There are countless shots of school exteriors, which seem scary, that last forever and probably to increase the life of the film. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at first). If the script was centered on his interesting character, we would have a movie to watch. She is so beautiful !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's movie "Blood For The Muse" (and better) is a special film. One thing I'd like to say is that this movie looks like a person who is not good at delivering the strike line at the end of a long joke because the end is the same. Again, just look at this for Ruby LaRocca.
