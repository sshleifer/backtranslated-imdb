This is one of the worst films of Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It's so painfully clich√© and the dialogue is so ugly that it's something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud to have done. <br /> <br /> Gable is a heel whose illegal activities make his daughter go 'slammer' (like gangster talk?). She hopes he'll do the right thing, but he leaves her there - unbeknownst to one of them, while she's "family-style". Finally, the thief comes back to make the right choice and one way or another he binds all this into a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable needed to take things in hand and spend several years in hoosegow. Leonard Maltin said "the stars are at their best here". At which level? Best to produce involuntary giggles? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> PS - After saying that, my wife thinks that Leonard Maltin will find me and kick my ass. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think that Mr. Maltin is the best critic and the human being on the planet (I hope it will soothe him). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I hated this movie so much the first time (especially the ridiculous ending), I decided to see it again. After all, sometimes, when I watch a movie again, I like it a lot more and I realize that I was a bit too hard. Although this has been the case with several movies in recent months, I still did not like this movie - even the second time. Most of it was not because of the first half of the film. In the first period, Harlow's character was incredibly stupid, but at least he was credible. But when she was sent to jail, everything was cliche until the last ridiculous scene of the wedding happened. The bottom line is that this movie is stupid and embarrassing - it makes no sense and turns the film into a wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two. I maintain my initial comment (despite all the "NOT USEFUL") and think that apart from PARNELL and maybe POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it could be the worst film of Gable.
