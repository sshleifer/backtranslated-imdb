I'm probably not shaking this movie because I could not watch everything. Maybe if I had seen it at the theater, in its original presentation, I might have liked it, but it's way too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot disappeared from memory. This did not help the film because it presents something less vivid and clear in its presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is actually four related movies, or a four-part film, and was, I believe, meant to be seen for four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I quite nice, but it was all I could do to get through Part II, which was hanging out interminably. To read the philosophy of Tolstoy is one thing. If you get a good translation or if you can read it in the original, its brilliant writing far outweighs any problem that one might have with the rhythm of the story. However, on film, it is difficult to reproduce without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the film that I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of camera work that draws attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story. <br /> <br /> It is clear that I am missing something, but I just could not get the enthusiasm to mount parts III and IV.
