Like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I do not expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film, but I expect the film to have at least one budget for the sorter. The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible dubbing. I know that in some movies, this has to be done and I accept that, but when they layer with a totally different actors' voice and continue doing it throughout the film, it takes overdubbing magic away. In addition, the decorations seem to have been built without care, because in a scene, the sliding glass top of a very secret laboratory is crossed by a huge crack. This film really disappointed me and I only hope that the next project Stevens will be more complete before sending the film to the purchase / lease. The story of this film made me wonder if I was watching a sci-fi movie or if some parts seemed strange, but they never fully explained what was happening, I found it very confusing.
