A nightmare on Elm Street: the dreamed child <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie. There is no way to escape. I like the show and I think Freddy is probably the best character of all time in horror movies. But even as a fan, I can not help but see that this film is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even the slightest attempt to create an interesting story and strong characters. At that moment, they had just given up. They do not even try. They are producing of course, hoping to earn a few more dollars. <br /> <br /> The story does not hold your attention. It is so simple that it is almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor of part 4 is pregnant. Freddy comes back in the baby's dreams. At first, we learn that to stop him, Alice must find his mother. And that's all. <br /> <br /> The story goes slowly because there is so little intrigue, which makes it quite boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and terrible acts. In fact, it's the only thing that scares the acting game, since the dead are not even a little cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we do not care less. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unappealing as possible. The whole cast made me think of a bad amateur theater group. I saw better actors in plays at school. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox always manages to give a little class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has talent. But the material did not let it shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> The work of Stephen Hopkins is nowhere near the brilliant direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Master. He tries some imaginative plans towards the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in previous films is not to be found. <br /> <br /> The dream child is only another suite without imagination. This is the kind of movie that gives a bad reputation to the horror series. <br /> <br /> The end for Freddy, once scary. It's too sad to see him now. A clown who is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
