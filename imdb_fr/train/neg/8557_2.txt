I admire 'Kiss on the mouth' for his franchise ?? Pubic haircut and masturbation, especially from director / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show truthfulness to "private" occurrences every day. Unfortunately, the film falls into the realm of the "Brown Rabbit", but with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it reflects "Bunny" with many things that do not happen, or too much focused (or sincerely untargeted) cinematographic shots on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was published and why people are praising: true sex scenes and frontal nudity (both male and female). Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We soon learn about a couple of post-graduate housemates in which the boy has obvious feelings for the woman who sees him as a friend while having sex with his ex-boyfriend. Apart from this, we are subject to the daily events of their boring life: she works for her parents; he is working on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For all this to work, the dialogue must be interesting and the actual acting game. Neither the work nor the other and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, that is, "The Brown Rabbit". The only actress who stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she plays questionable roles. (The extra DVD with her in front of a microphone is definitely worth watching / listening to.) Once again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for revealing everything and not being afraid to expose themselves take a shower-habits, but overall, the film falls flat. There are narrations that do not fit the scenes, too many boring daily events, and unconvincing actors you wonder, aside from the pornographic factor, why you rented this.
