These 2 points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood movies do not really want to be realistic, but PLEASE, a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and doing what every good parent does ... Put his son out with his pregnant wife. Some things that were too difficult to swallow- 1. Priyanka 'a cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and then move from there to live hungry in his in-law garden shed ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the stunt job, gets stung by a mad dog, and then leaves. This film is an insult to our intelligence. I really can not believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who made this film by taking my family to see him. We left the cinema with a frown. this takes my advice and does not waste your 'waqt'.
