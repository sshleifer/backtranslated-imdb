This film starts very slowly, but when the action finally begins, you have to follow a little. I did not understand why certain events had taken place, and many of them happened before they were explained, which made them confused. The only thing that really matters is the massive amount of blood / blood, although most special effects are missing. The blood is like red Kool-Aid. The torn skin gives the impression that someone is walking on a pile of sticks. Once again, the story has an amateur character, as the writer did not take long to perfect. I think the film could be a lot better if the effects were better done and if the story took longer. I sincerely wish I had not looked at her, not because of the gore, but because I feel that I have lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, this is for you, otherwise stay away.
