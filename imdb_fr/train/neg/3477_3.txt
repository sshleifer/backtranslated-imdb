James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are accomplished professionals. They are very good at just about everything. In the end, "Survive" is not the worst holiday movie you can see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is unclear and much of the comedy is forced. Black humor attempts are rather dubious. Affleck tries to be too spastic and enthusiastic but seems confused. The caricatural nature of her character takes on all its magnitude when viewed alongside the darker and credible performances of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you never quite like the Affleck setup "renting" this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that look like unreal things. The Christmas scene, bursting with incestuous humor (an uncovered son looking at naked and provocative pictures of his mother) is not only funny but credible, but disturbing. <br /> To make matters worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost black. The decor of the house where most of the film takes place is flat and inexpensive. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is of particular interest. this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen what will be the duration of the damage.
