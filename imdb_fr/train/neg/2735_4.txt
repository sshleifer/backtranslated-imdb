I thought it was not the best episode of wrap I've ever seen (although my viewing partner gave me a handkerchief in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's time ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox outside of his ever-fragile "State of Coxism", which is nowadays, if only for brief moments. I also liked to try to place the included episodes according to the length of the hair of the character (or the size, in case of JD) and the youth of the first episodes. I can also see how Zach could be on the way to a very Chevrolet Chase / or is it Matthew Perry? Chemical slipping induced by the fall (already recognized on Conan). A small note aside, the song (now stuck in my head) of the dance editing induced by the janitor was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
