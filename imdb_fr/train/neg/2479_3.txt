I first heard about Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" books: according to this story, the Wendigo - after calling you in the wind - drags you, then takes you to the sky and sprays you. Although this seems a rather bizarre notion, Schwartz's story has made it quite coherent. <br /> <br /> This is not the case of the movie "Wendigo". It's basically every horror movie shot: the family is moving into a new house and strange things are starting to happen, whoever's harming them is harmful, and everyone should listen to the old Indian. I have seen this so many times that I do not count on counting anymore. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the Middle") did a lot better than that.
