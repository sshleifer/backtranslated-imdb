Unknown creature is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie is a shit from the start. He has a really stupid "plot", a really pathetic "acting game" and "so-so" special effects. <br /> <br /> Some "post-teens" in their thirties are trapped in the woods with a crazy, reptilian creature in a rubber suit that hides endlessly. What you get with this movie is a lot of talk and valuable little actions. You have girls walking in the woods talking, then you have guys (with a thick mascara) walking in the woods talking. All this is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is rarely seen in most of the movie. When shown, the image is distorted to hide the fact that it is a man wearing a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a combination, hence blur and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in ANY motive, and those who rented it are probably the ones who were taken to the streets to "play" in this truly amazing movie! Skip this one for sure!
