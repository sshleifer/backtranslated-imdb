Want to watch a scary horror movie? So avoid this one. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can handle it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments have not stopped you from watching this movie soberly, let me help you out. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A huge solar flare causes Colonel Steve West's bleeding nose. From there, things go bad and madness ensues. <br /> <br /> In fact, I read the adaptation of the book, published and published only in the United Kingdom. Thousand better than the movie, and the book was terrible. At least one pretext is made towards the suspense, and a kind of explanation of the events is extracted from the author (rhymes with "gas"). <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he had to read a contract before signing a film and Jonathan Demme discovered that he was really better able to lead. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K that presents this film, but it is of course a little edited. Without the obligatory blinking of the breasts, not even the healing power of the tape can save you. <br /> <br /> Please, just look at The Lost Ark Adventurers if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, in good conscience, recommend this film to the sober audience of the cinema.
