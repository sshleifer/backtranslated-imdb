Wise Blood by John Huston was a more frightening representation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. Terrible performances in acting (and you, "Oh, that was done on purpose, you do not understand that!") At the score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was disgusting. At first, I saw it without ill-will and I was expecting a pleasant experience. But the false portrayal of the Southern characters, of the ridiculously fraudulent draft in the South in the pleasant and comical way of describing their faith, was inexcusable. Until the end, totally devoid of any sense of character, O'Connor's book failed and failed everywhere. Actors portraying the "south" of the police might as well have eaten hot dogs smothered from New York's street stalls and quoting the godfather. The living and deadly portrayal of Hoover Shoates, a religious crook who hears the Moates preach the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities, was one of the most remarkable representations. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its appalling religious stream that imprints the seemingly lifeless corpse of "Faith". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as understood by myself and most of his fans, if I may say so. Although I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to express, I have enough affection for her and her work to want to remain a fan. If I had seen Wise Blood as Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For the sake of Flannery and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting ... it will take time.
