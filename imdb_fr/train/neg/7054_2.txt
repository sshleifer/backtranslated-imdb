This film was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful scenario and the lack of history let me watch three losers drooling in front of girls in bikinis. Sometimes I felt like watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit down during the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints and Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only interesting part of the film is the parody about Anu Malik and his obsession with shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran to lock and synchronize a chart. Overall, it seems that Emran does not have a good Bhatts script to save it this time.
