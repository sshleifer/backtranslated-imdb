There are some Stallone films that I like, but this film did not meet my expectations. I found this film hard to believe. For example, a group of terrorists crushing desert lands are ready to survive for at least two days. In addition, throughout this wilderness, Stallone and his company continue to browse bridges and ladders providing useful shortcuts or tracing tools. In addition, the police officers of the Treasury do not seem to coordinate anything with the local rescuers. In addition, the bad guys who could not touch the side of a barn with very sophisticated automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I loved John Lithgow's villain at first, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not do it. Do not worry at all about your own bad guys, or all get killed. Finally, I could not believe the character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, nor even the time to watch.
