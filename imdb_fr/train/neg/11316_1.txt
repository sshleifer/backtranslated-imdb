Knights was just the beginning of the series, a pilot, you might say. The plot (I really should not call it that, there was none) was not logical at all and there were a lot of mistakes, like [warning, I summarize the plot]: < At the beginning of the movie, someone said that there were only two of these cyborgs (bad guys), but after the climax, Nea discovered that there was a lot more . And it was said that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them all at once. <br /> <br /> The film was a pure kick. I was not surprised at all when I learned that the main star was a kickboxer. <br /> <br /> There was one positive thing in the whole movie: it really made a lot of laugh when we look at it. and talk about it with my friends. I recommend watching it, if you need to laugh.
