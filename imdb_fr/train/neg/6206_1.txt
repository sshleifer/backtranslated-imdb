Thomas Clay mixed with the bad guys. This is the problem of young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film must be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather heavy, and it eventually sinks into the madness of the drug, as if, like its director, there was no better place to go. We are introduced to the main character who is a bit of a stranger, we see him at school and at home not very in his place, we feel embarrassed in himself as so many teenagers do. Robert falls with bad boys and starts to miss school and drug and, before you know it, he is a psychological rapist. <br /> <br /> The film actually talks about Clay's complete inability to understand the links between the image and the acts of violence. Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy young people is made diabolical by war scenes on television. Yet he filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay did not see YouTube, he may be na√Øve and will not realize that the scene of the brutal climax of his film will be over. All we want to see is the most hideous scene at the end of the film and I'm sure it will be what will stay with people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is useless to commit such an act of violence against the film. Clay not only curses young people actively engaged in the prevention of war, he also curses himself as the author of extreme and insipid violence. for no other reason than his personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Shame on all concerned.
