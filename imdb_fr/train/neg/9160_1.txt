This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it to Netflix and made me watch. There are so many blunders and blunders that you can not get used to the characters and the plot. How about these for example ... <br /> <br /> Vermont airport surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's shirt appearing miraculously during a phone conversation < br /> <br /> The office of the priest in a palace ... with a folding card table <br /> <br /> A story worthy of the name is hidden behind a very bad film. But even if you look beyond the technical flaws, you will find actors and horrible actors. I was particularly amazed by the choice of an extremely gay and cheerful actor to play the right-wing religious zealot brother. His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, caressing his cat, was hilarious. <br /> <br /> I applaud the author, the director, the producer, the editor, the star, the caterer, the dentist and the composer makes this movement) to actually get a film like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, this could be a fun group movie or even the basics of a drinking game, but do not rent it for a compelling story about homophobia and gay marriage.
