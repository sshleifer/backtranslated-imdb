you can say they spent $ 5 to do this. It's a waste of time ... uh .. there's nothing really good about this movie ... .. i do not know why i I watched it .. the chick is not hot. play horrible .. you can do anything and it's a better use of your time ... like watching TV playing shit video games .. i feel stolen. just stolen .. of my time. I've never done a film review before, as you probably can say, but it felt like I needed to save the poor souls who are about to watch it and watch IMDb before they see it's decent and watch the comments. - there was no action - no hot chicks - no budget - -shittttttttttttttty acting screaming bad movie. **** the whole movie is in a room. ***
