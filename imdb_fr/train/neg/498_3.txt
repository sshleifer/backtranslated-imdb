I saw this movie when I was a lot younger and I thought it was funny. I saw him last week and you can guess the result. Some fun parts, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a full movie B, it's a good choice, but do not expect too much the size of an alien dwarf
