I have not seen any film from this band yet and I think I could be first. <br /> <br /> It was horrible. In fact, I did not look at the end. It was like looking at a boring soap or a very good soap (all the soaps are shit). The actors were poor and the scenario was bad. The person who wrote it 10/10 has no idea what he is talking about. The script was awful. 2 People were in angry conversation that involved threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and beat him but no. He says, "If you do that ... I will hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, pay attention. Please do not watch this movie because ... it's crap !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad interpretation, bad fights, bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Do not look! Of course, that's my opinion.
