To this day, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people do not talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses, Japanese cinema means all these monsters that we love to destroy these Japanese cities again and again, many times in battles against each other. The first and most important of them is Godzilla, who has returned at least a dozen times and, in some films, has faced the three-headed hydra, Ghidrah, a space monster. <br /> <br /> Curiously, it corresponds to the time, the special effects have improved slightly. But part of the charm of these old movies has been to see these decors of paper mache cities destroyed. They looked so phony, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some visitors of the future have already traveled to Japan that Godzilla is destroyed from its discovery. And in fact, it was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during the Second World War, when it protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from these American troops. But later, with the atomic tests on Bikini, the friendly dinosaur Godzilla, like Barney, became the nasty machine that we know now in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, you eliminate Godzilla before giving Ghidrah a clear field. destroy Japan so that it does not become the economic colossus that it was in 1991 when the film was released. I will not say more, but we all know that Japan is doing pretty well in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster movies, relax and enjoy the chaos.
