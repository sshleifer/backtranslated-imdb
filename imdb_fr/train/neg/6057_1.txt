Could someone please prevent John Carpenter from continually and deliberately ruining his reputation? How far can you go? It seems that this man has lost all respect for himself. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been directed by a film student. It's not even worth starting to talk about WHAT was bad, because it was just a borefest, run by someone who has no cinematographer talent or who has no motivation ... <br /> > Go on, Mr. Carpenter, retire immediately with a little self-esteem and stop throwing garbage like this. in a bad tradition of Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
