<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this film is how to film a school musical and wear only 3 of its 15 songs! merman and lahr played the main roles on broadway, replacing them here with the weaker red skelton and lucille ball. intrigue changes abound and pleasure is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
