I encourage films that fill the gaps in world cinema. So, after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies", I was expecting to like this film because I thought I had stumbled on something unique: a film that honestly describes the lesbian love of teenage girls - a female version from "Beautiful Thing". <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French women aged 15 years old. Marie is slender, reluctant, and pretty as a tomboy; Floriane is sociable, sporty and beautiful; and Anne is faithful, chubby and immature. The erotic relationships between Marie and Floriane are always simmering in this film, if not on the surface, but just below. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, does not concern the appearance of lesbian love on two teenage girls; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, teenagers working against the tide and - in at least two cases - sexless and mechanical sex. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers ruin their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the DVD "The lord of the flies", the director Peter Brook declares: "The French cynicism begins with the excitement of the sex", which means that the French consider the children like angels, while they see teenagers and adults with omnipresent cynicism. Filmmaker Sciamma, one of the victims of this film, has swallowed a huge dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is the joy?" I wondered while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyous and triumphantly erotic in a new and invigorating way. These positive aspects are missing in this film. there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film is a poignant celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed by her cynicism and intelligence and ruins the film. First, what is the point of showing only the fleshy naked girl? I know there is a well-established tradition of teenage nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by such films as "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The Little Robber; Murmur of the Heart Friends, Beau Pere "and" Europa, Europa "; but this example is an intrusion of little author - "You see, audience, I can make a movie where I only show the naked person, unattractive." No nudity or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to leave. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance. What follows is not that Floriane manipulates Marie cynically; it is the filmmaker Sciamma who manipulates his audience cynically. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty occurs when Floriane warns Mary that she is about to ask for something that is not "normal" ". Marie naturally asks, "Who cares to be normal?" Then Sciamma plays wrong with his audience and the dynamics of the film, because Floriane's request is a fictitious, derivative and substitutable question - and not the authentic and sincere question of the film, the character of Marie and the viewers who have invested their time . <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that graze the nerves of the viewer: 1) Since when do the French - of all people - take a bath in a swimsuit and with a turtle and more? 2) What teenager - of any nationality - was he chopping an apple core thrown in the trash for a taste of the beloved's mouth? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, can become excellent actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress technically and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a leading woman, a bomb or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has an undeniable intensity and magnetism. In the future, she could play everything from an emotionally paralyzed librarian to a sensual and mysterious seductress to a reluctant politician making a meteoric rise. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. Does a filmmaker integrate an authentic film about two young women who fall in love! Not - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged man - but so that young lesbians can have something of quality with which they can look and identify. And yes, to fill a gap in world cinema.
