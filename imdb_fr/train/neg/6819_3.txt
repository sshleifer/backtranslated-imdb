in this movie, joe pesci slams a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and as it is consistent, the rest of the script is also implausible. <br /> <br /> pesci is a funny guy, which prevents this film from flowing in the absolute at the back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was an avid businessman who valued money more than people, which was not even well played. instead of this man being an archetypal villain, he looked more like an amoral android programmed to make money at any cost. Then there is the symbolic coin that is attributed to pesci as a girlfriend or something like that ... I do not even remember it ... it was also forgettable. is a paid member of a film studio seeking to enhance the reputation of this sinking film, or at least one of those millions of media henchmen who can not critically criticize (you know, people who feel bad about themselves if they give mark below 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... far away. and shame at the central comedy, where I saw this movie. they generally choose better.
