Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to mitigate this one. Let's be real !!! Nobody wants to see a movie of Chuck Norris where HE is not the main character. There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I wonder if old Chuck can not stay with the best. Has he slowed down so much that he is forced to do junk food like this and hopes his reputation will take him through the movie? Chuck is an excellent martial artist and, as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a very good actor, but the trick is to combine these two qualities in his films, which is not the case. Very disappointing for us fans of Norris. Chuck, remains the main character of your movies, because it does not work for you ... Gary
