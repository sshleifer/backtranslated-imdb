Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, two of my least favorite actors of this century, are teaming up to try to piece together the most flattering attempt to redo the gruesome The Butterfly Effect. Awake is so dull and so uninteresting that it would be better to sleep. Terrance Howard is still recovering from the evil August Rush. He fights like a sadistic doctor who seems doomed to murder Christianson. After watching his performance, I would be happy to attend. <br /> <br /> Alba, still recovering from Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. It is naturally disastrous and just as impractical as it has always been. Once, she has always been pretty brilliant. It was in the hands of master-director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. It could be that Jessica Alba is not as poor as an actress that most attribute to her the merit, and it is perhaps that her acting abilities are undermined by a mediocre scenario. If so, that would explain Awake. With a scenario that would shame that of Plan 9 of outer space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard play the lead role in the psychological thriller about a man, the first director / screenwriter of Joby Harold who undergoes the awfully common surgical phenomenon known as of "aesthetic awareness", in which people placed on the operating table remain extremely aware of what is happening around them even though they remain completely paralyzed and unable to ask for help. When a thriving young man (Christenson) passes under the knife and realizes that the anesthesia has not done his job yet, the horror sets in as his worried wife (Alba) waits anxiously and a drama terrifying takes place in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hoping to do what Final Destination did for the aircraft for the operating tables, this first effort by director Joby Harold is based on a concept frozen in blood. The pre-credit sequence indicates that one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon called "anesthetic awareness," in which the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen) is one of those unfortunate people. He feels completely awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every slice. <br /> <br /> Intermittently, it is inventive to find your tortured person. psyche, Awake fails to inject a real terror into his new premises. Moving from chilling simplicity to an absurd conspiracy, he is prevented by the stilt turns of Christensen and Jessica Alba. You wish you blew a sedative before looking ?? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Awake is, at best, extremely simple. A no-punch sweater film that undoubtedly has a better rendering on paper. As a film, it is terribly generic and extremely derivative. Awake fails to inject terror into his new premises. The end result is really ugly. Alba and Christian are the least of your worries because the main defect of the film lies in its inability to frighten its audience. Awake is a movie in which you will probably sleep.
