First of all, anyone who thinks that this sequel to William Friedkin's "The French Connection" is superior is absolutely completely crazy or stupid, or both. The problem with the criticism of this film is that, a.) It is a sequel to a brilliant film, which always makes it difficult to look at it objectively, and b.) This is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the Best American directors of all time, so I wanted I like that. William Friendkin was the ideal person to make a film about drug trafficking in New York, because of his documentary approach to action and history. Frankenhimer, on the other hand, is one of the most elegant directors of all times, namely "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds", and with his "French Connection 2", it's like being in the mind of someone who try to be serious and who does not have the true understanding to succeed. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the sequel by Gene Hackman himself speaks volumes about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed never to work with him again. He also knew he was considering the character as one-dimensional, losing weight and trying to play him as a straight person. This shows that Hackman, although a great actor, had no idea who would make the film and the good story. The plot that Doyle becomes an addict is interesting, but does not justify the rest of the film. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
