It's only the second time I stop a video / DVD along the way. <br /> <br /> I first wanted to give this film the benefit of the doubt, even if it managed to be at the same time superficial, clich√© and stupid .. AND without joy, which walked and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like a special program after school run by this strange ninth grade child who thinks no one understands it ... sad and scary, with only one teenage narrative the most delusional might consider poetry ... and some songs, and ... no, really, the poor child's suffering ... <br /> <br /> Enough, already, especially when it has turned into awkward fright , and insulting scam Orange mechanical. And did I mention singing? <br /> <br /> It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but the one I felt the least. I do not recommend it to anyone.
