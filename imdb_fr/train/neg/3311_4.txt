Saving Grace is surely one of the main contenders for the "How to ruin an adequate film in the last minutes" prize. Of course, if you mix a picturesque village in Cornwall - populated largely by distinguished ladies in retirement - with a generous dose of marijuana, some foolishness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film go down in ridicule and are not even bought by a particular joke. It's a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be as good as the one of 1998, Waking Ned Devine, which also describes a small picturesque village and its strange inhabitants trying to get out of this delicate situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is Grace Trevethyn, a widow recently widowed, whose legacy of bad debts forced her husband to force her to earn money unconventionally. With the help of her gardener, Matthew, she puts her horticultural expertise to the profit of the lucrative marijuana crop. Unfortunately, this leads to a confrontation with the local police, the creditors of her husband and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . who all come to his greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and the relationship between Grace and Matthew are well portrayed and Brenda Blethyn emotionally drives the viewer into her friendly character - you can really feel what she's going through. <br /> <br /> The distribution of minor roles is excellent, although some are rather eccentric. However, the transformation of James the drug lord into a romantic interest for Grace is highly implausible and does not correspond at all to the tone of the film. And is not hydroponics a revolution in the world of cannabis cultivation? Unfortunately, the film exchanges sweet humor for burlesque and ends up being as fake as marijuana plants.
