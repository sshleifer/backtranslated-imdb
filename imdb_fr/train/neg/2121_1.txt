Frankly, it also looked like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What is it with Will Smith that I can not bear anymore? I guess he seems too inclined to be taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how biased it is, but unless he gets new lessons in acting, I will never see him win one. He is a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I credit him for having tried so much and being able to cry at any time. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds is a bit of an eyeroller for me right from the start. The 911 suicide call did not intrigue me in any way. I was not curious about why he was calling in his own suicide. There was absolutely no surprise. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had a decent screen chemistry. Plus, I do not know her name, but the Hispanic woman did a great job with her role as a frightened and battered wife. Woody Harrelson had very little time on the screen, but I would say he stole the show when he was on the spot. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an extremely banal plot. I could not help wondering why I cared about one or the other of these people. Never had any pity for 'Tim / Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Is the only survivor in an accident of 8 people? Geewiz ... did not see that coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
