This film is AWFUL. I did not laugh so loud about a movie that was involuntarily funny for a long time. Leno should have stayed up to watch TV late at night. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie itself is the most stupid movie I have ever seen. it's pathetic, the acting is horrible, and the plot could have been written by a 4 year old. do not get me wrong, Jay Leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
