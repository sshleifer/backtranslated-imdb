Of Human Bondage by W. Somerset Maugham is supposed to be a classic of the English language. If so, a lot of things are missing in the movie version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard's) appeal to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that it seems like the scenario resembles the post-breaking transcript of a relationship from a man's point of view. As a family lawyer, I have heard many stories of this type. the man describes himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hell that has no other objective than to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, unless someone wants to laugh at the filmmaker's social assumptions, it's an uncomfortable film to watch. Phillip even pleases Mildred when she brings a baby to indeterminate paternity, but the real highlight is when Phillip authorizes Mildred - enraged and now of dubious mental health - free movement of his apartment, with predictable results. Bette Davis has been attractive for about five years of her life, but this period did not happen here. In fact, at the end of the film, she looks a lot like the character of Baby Jane with whom she would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I notice how the character of Howard is always impeccably dressed and neat. It tells me that Phillip aspires to the respectability of the middle class. Someone like this one could not run away quickly enough with a Cockney accent of course. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; such a person would have been more credible if she had been younger and had seemed disgusted, testifying to the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as he goes. And balanced that by allowing Mildred a minimum of charm.
