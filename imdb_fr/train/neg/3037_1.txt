It's one of those stereotypical dance films of the MTV generation, and I do not see where all the garbage comes from-it's not that bad. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same scenario as all the other "dancing" movies. It's terrible! The name should shout not to look. 'How she moves.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half-decent dance scenes, which did not even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 in 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously urge anyone with an IQ over 60 to not look at it and not waste your money. The 1.6 / 10 should say everything. This film should not even have been done.
