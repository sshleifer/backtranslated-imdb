I found that Darkness was too dark. There was some kind of great idea and ambitious ideas, no bad action scenes and a few moments of relaxation to get you through your head! BUT, he was underestimated to the point of confusion. You do not really know what's going on in dark scenes, and for a movie shot in Super 8 Movie, you already have all that bad stuff to deal with. Like Nathan Schiff's movies, it's too much. The director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it. The camera is never directed to the right place. The absence of basic principles such as how to film simple dialogue scenes and how to illuminate a film also hurts. The actors are all very uneven and hammered. But despite these disadvantages, the music is good, the gore is plentiful and goes silly putty to very good devices. Is it a classic as it says? Does this deserve both records? NO. But it's a good first try. Now, if these guys stopped congratulating themselves on this movie (as I understand it here, it's the only movie they've ever done) for a while and they're still trying, they could do better.
