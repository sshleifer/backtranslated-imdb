Now, I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see why you should be wasting money on a movie you could shoot with your father's camcorder. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a FILM, not a group of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste MiniDV tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, it has the most stupid plot of all time, the most unrealistic characters of all time and the very, really, really the worst show of all time the history of the movies. Even Tom Savini can not save that. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this one is a waste of time.
