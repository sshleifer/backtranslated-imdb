After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and who was the preacher of this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this movie and I was not disappointed. A man is planning to kill his new wife by convincing others that she is crazy and will commit suicide. Unbeknownst to the husband is that the plastic-looking skull he uses is a woman ghost, apparently his first dead wife is avenging his mind and using a real skull. A simple plot with a touch of irony at the end. If you are tired one night and need sleep, it will help you sleep.
