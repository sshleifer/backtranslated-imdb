A horrible ending - and I can not believe that Moore spent a year conceiving it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetits, whom Hubbard claimed to have written in only three weeks. It was actually quite disappointing for me to release my records for the first 3.5 years. Now, the first half hours have been action-packed, albeit absurd on the assumption, then they have degraded into a slow, painful and sophisticated dissolution of the series. Incredible how slow and slow the last hour was. Should we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would reread Ishmael Daniel Quinn. Absurd to think that the 38,000 people would give up everything for a "fresh start". Absurd to throw a disappearing Kara, and a Baltar and Six who reappear. Absurd to participate in the mitochondrial watch. Absurd.
