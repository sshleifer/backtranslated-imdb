"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. The "Loony Tunes" have many spinoffs and different versions, some good, some not. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derives from series like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". . There was no similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly done. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show just does not work. This horrible waste of animation is a total failure and it should not be anything but a bad joke. Blade! Zero stars
