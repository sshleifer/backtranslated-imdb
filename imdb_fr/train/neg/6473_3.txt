As a child, the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week later, I watched this movie for the first time. I think this movie was like most suites and did not surpass their original. I think I may feel it because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It begins when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (the sister of Eurselas), so they build a big wall around their house at the edge of the sea. As Melody grows up, she starts to marvel outside the walls where he is forbidden to go. The problems arise as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give up the film, you have to see it to find out. I liked that the voices are the same and sing again wonderfully. I think it's a good family movie overall!
