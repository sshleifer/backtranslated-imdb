Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I will find them nice. This one is so bad that I'm running out of words to describe it - it's below "bad". An instruction at the beginning of the movie tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instructions and a dozen beers could not help me go through the entire movie. A tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligence. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to make you buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you plan to rent it, ask it! If you are thinking of buying, do not think! If you are not lucky enough to have this DVD, do not play it, throw it in the trash immediately.
