Very probably. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least stick to his native France), has managed to shoot a film as completely unassailable as it is impossible to reason of a mere mortal man to discern. It's not just that the characters are so unfriendly or that the film is so devoid of any form of mind: it's really painful to watch, such an endless parade of writing, acting and filming that you can not believe is the work of experienced filmmakers - and talented. For once, the almost eternity spent in the editing room and on the shelves before his theatrical release you like, tells the whole story. What were they thinking?
