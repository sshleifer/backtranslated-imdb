How Grolch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas drawing that everyone could easily appreciate, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake made with humans, the drawing was just perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little strange that Jim Carrey was the Grinch. I mean he's an excellent comic actor, but he's like Grinch? It made no sense to me. His performance was a little exaggerated and unintentionally laughable at times. Not to mention some of the added dialogues was a little childish and not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over and was not necessary. In fact, they just destroyed the story, period. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is preparing for their best Christmas season, but everything is set to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch who lives above them and for the fact that he will not get as good a Christmas as the other. He throws her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that in fact, he should just steal Christmas together to show who his Christmas version is. But he soon realizes that those who know know that it is a little more than the material version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> The way the Grinch Stole stole was made useless and a little exaggerated. I really recommend you stick to caricature just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The layout and presentation of the entire movie was a little over, besides How the Grinch stole Christmas! was more intended to be a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Karloff that is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
