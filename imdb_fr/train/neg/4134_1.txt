Honestly, I must say that I could not stop watching this movie from the beginning. Just how it was !!! It's a bit like watching paint dry just a lot more confusing. I mean you sit around waiting for something to happen, something in fact, preferably something that makes sense of the whole movie! At the end of the film, I wondered if I missed the first hour that explained everything or if I lost it inadvertently during the film and the parts that stuck the plot (if there were in fact a set! The main thing that really baffled me about this movie is almost at the end that the main girl (if there was a main girl) was in some kind of alternative reality, I mean what was happening at this point ?! all of a sudden she woke up and was in a psychiatric institute, chained to a drugged bed by doctors or something, and then more quickly than it took me to cut my wrists, he turned around and she was eaten by some vampire that made no sense! I am tempted to send an email to the filmmakers asking them to get my time back, I mean, I lost 2 hours of my life watching this garbage! I'm a little curious to know if the filmmakers themselves really knew what it was! It seemed to me that someone had corrected all the elements that could have made sense to him although I think the film should have lasted 4 hours for this to happen! I completely stand with the other person who wrote the other critic, I was duped royally with this film by its title, and that alone. I am so grateful that I did not buy the film, no matter how many times it was seen in the pound shop. You would have thought it would have given me an idea that the movie was a complete pile of rubbish, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 was way too much money to spend on this movie !!!! what a huge waste of time and a good razor blade, I want to say that I would like, it is less painful than watching this movie !!!!
