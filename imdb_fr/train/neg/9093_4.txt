I saw this film today for the first time and I had never heard of it before, probably because of its bad message. <br /> <br /> First, the staging is pretty good, the actors have played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is beautiful. But that alone does not make a movie. No story at all, no message behind beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to remind people, the art of the director is not only your vision, but also to know how to tell a story. And that's what's missing at 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> The rating is 4.
