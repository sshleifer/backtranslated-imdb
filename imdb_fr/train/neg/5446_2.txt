Ignore this one for loyal fans of Duran Duran who want to watch a good music video. The producers have decided to be creative and make this 80s video a science fiction story featuring the villainous villain Barbarella, behind the band's name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that, in the midst of great Duran Duran songs of the 80s, there are confusing and embarrassing scenes showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts. Not only is the good music interrupted several times, but we must also endure derisory stories led by a demon Dr. Mario. It's almost too hard to bear. 2/10
