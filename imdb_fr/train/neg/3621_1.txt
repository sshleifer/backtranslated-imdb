I hated this show when I was a child. It was when kids were showing that characters had accents, not just the fade, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was from the south. As mentioned by one of the others, however, I never really understood what the market was with the witch who wanted the flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute was boring and I would have no trouble removing it! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity between Pufnstuf and the McDonalds commercials of the early '70s that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf tore up McDonalds. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the TV show (or rather its creators) sought a license for McDonald's characters, but when McDonalds declined the show, it slightly changed the characters and adopted them . They even hired former employees of the McDonalds advertising agency and comedians for the production of television shows. McDonalds sued and won. Look for the McDonaldland Pufnstuf trial and you will find many articles about it.
