Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and rightly so. So I'm happy to see one of their movies. Basically, a man from a horn factory is the fourth to crack, and soon enough, Ollie cracks with all the sounds of horn. He is resting at home with Stan by his side, he needs calm and the Doctor (James Finlayson) phones to tell him that he comes to see Ollie. After realizing that the plumbing and electricity were scrambled by a repairman with eyes crossed, the doctor came for a checkup and, after a few tests, he recommended drinking goat's milk and taking a little air sailor on the ocean. After Stan played the trumpet, trailing by the window near the phone cord and after a car accident, he and Ollie went to a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the pier to milk a goat and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, on the front page of the newspaper, Killer Nick Grainger - A convicted escapee (Richard Cramer) escaped. He sneaks into the boys' boat as he sleeps and the goat chews the rope adrift and heads for the sea. In the morning, they see where they are and the killer is asking for something to eat. He notices that Stan and Ollie are making fake food, for example. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and it forces them to eat it. When Ollie begins to choke on something, Stan rings the trumpet to help him. Oller's rage makes him hit the Killer, and it continues until the police arrive, only so that Oller's rage will also put them in jail. There have been the most minute moments of comedy, but it's not a big black and white movie. "Well, here is another beautiful mess in which you put me!" was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Okay!
