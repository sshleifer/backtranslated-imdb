Is a remake of the thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are so many detractors from previous movies deny denying it. <br /> <br /> So the game is bad, James Spader is doing a super super Stargate re-enactment of himself, with his cup of coffee and some strange thoughts / moves, but that's about it all the other actors that I have not even notified. You do not feel like you know anyone of the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring and, yes, I know what will happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is very boring, there are a lot of amazing people who would score for a coke and a credit, but it's a big shit. Some of the special effects are good, if it was done in the early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, thrills and thrills, do not play this movie. It's a dull combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and a Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production that went really bad. Now, this combination would be great if someone knew what they were doing, and the only ones in this production who knew it was never anything. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie. to anyone, but if you're up on a cold night and you just want to look at something, it's going to be slow, slowly.
