What a stinkeroo that turned out to be !!! Linda Darnell was one of my favorite ones at one point in her career - not a big jerk as an actress, but very beautiful and enjoyable (especially in films like "The Brand of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand "), but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of his golden days fade quickly. The story is incredible and ridiculous, the second acting role, the support casting unbearable. I can not think of a more immature performance of anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray was to be the most boring leader he could have chosen. Added to this is the terrible photography (and I'm not just talking about color!) All those associated with this must have shuddered at each screening.
