Apparently, most viewers are unaware of the history of Europe, especially Germany, Hungary and all of central and eastern Europe, as well as the Hitlerite and Stalinist era. Nuremberg (and many forgotten trials throughout Europe) has been a revenge and an injustice of the victors. What do you think, why no American, British, French or Soviet defendant after the Second World War? No US, British war crimes, etc. There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but at Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (This was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is an awful and despicable American brainwashing instrument, filled with mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudices and injustices. And first: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why was the Nuremberg process not enough? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and this hatred, narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, etc. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo America! Very clever. Even Stalin would become envious ...
