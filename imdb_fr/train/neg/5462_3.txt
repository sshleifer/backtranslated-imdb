This program bugs me! There is no humor and it is far too serious to be called "fun"! It's way too educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. Plots are redundant and morality repeats itself again and again. Where is the pleasure? In addition, I have the feeling that it has been on the BBC for far too long and that it is much too broadcast. Should we really have a spot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to start reporting some of their older shows such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons, and Count Duckula, apart from continually giving contracts to these new issues! I thought the BBC had reported Danger Mouse, so what's up with that ?! 3/10
