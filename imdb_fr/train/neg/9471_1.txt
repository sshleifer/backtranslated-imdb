Do not get me wrong, I thought this movie would be stupid, honestly I did it, I gave it an incredibly low level to respect. The only reason I even saw it was because there was a group of girls (different story for a different time). When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now, there are two types of terrible, there is Freddy against Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit laughing and joking about the fact that it's terrible, and then there's a movie like this . The cat in the hat did not manage to create a momentary interest for me. Looking at the first part, not only did I get bored, but I felt as if I had somehow been raped by the awful movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I like most of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that the director / producer / writer / songwriter has changed is that they refused to use the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character except Cat. . Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture the original (and I hate to use that word, but it matches) the zaniness of the original. The book looked like a Sunday of ice cream, colorful and delicious, and the film was almost as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a leprous prostitute.
