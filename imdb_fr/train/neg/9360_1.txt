My score for this shit: 1/10 1 for the technique only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that makes no sense. It is clear that creating a good scenario for film or television is a mission almost impossible. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are some of the biggest liars on the planet, but it's hard to understand how to make such pathetic films. <br /> <br /> We must believe that taking people for morons. Maybe that was a reason to believe, since 99% of the movies are shit. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give at the Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And oddly enough, it was still money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this show, press the super fast forward button (at least 20X).
