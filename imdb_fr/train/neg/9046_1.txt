Now, for the truth, his screenplay is very very low - for a Walt Disney movie, his total crap. When the robinson appeared, the movies everywhere, I was shocked to see how poor it was. It's like "Alice in Wonderland" that went wrong !. It seems like they've run out of ideas, some have crushed some crazy trash to try to get out - and they do not have it. After that, I sat there wishing the end. My younger brother lost interest at the halfway point and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the appearance of robinsons, you do not worry about the end, you just want the film ends. It's a movie to forget, and to forget quickly. If you have free time, do not waste it.
