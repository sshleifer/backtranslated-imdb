I saw it last week after buying the cheap DVD. I wanted to see it for ages, finding the intriguing outline of the plot. So, my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the main actor was very flat. This kind of game required a similar performance to Johnny Depp's The Ninth Gate (which is a real scam), but I suppose TV budgets do not always go beyond this type of acting ability . <br /> <br /> I also thought that the direction was confused and boring, serving only to remind me that Carpenter had not made a movie worthy of the name since In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story, I was disappointed too! I guess it was impossible to meet my expectations, but I thought the result and explanation were mediocre and that the film was ultimately anti-culminating at the very least. <br /> <br /> This was written by one of the main contributors to the AICN, and you can say that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result thanks to such a good premise. <br /> <br /> I brought the DVD back to the store the same day!
