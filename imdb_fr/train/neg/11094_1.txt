This film is another on my Not to Bother With movie list. I saw her 40 years ago as a teenager, I stayed awake late to do it, she was very upset to find that it was about 95% romance, 4% of everything else , 1% of history so. This is what I call a bait and substitute film, a movie with an interesting title, the film itself is a scam. This is a subject that deserves a good cinematic treatment, this film is almost an insult to those who served. The current members of Escadrille Lafayette were not fleeing, they were not the product of abusive fires, they were actually idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a middle class higher than the character of Tab Hunter. The flying school is not made for bad people and everyone knows that an individual such as the one described here would not have lasted two days, it was the palisade or the infantry. Discipline in the French army was often rather fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
