No, not the administration of GWB, the Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". Lifetime must have realized how it was a dog, because the series had been burned two episodes at a time, most of them aired between 23:00 and 23:00. Friday night and Saturday morning. As for why I watched all this, I can only plead for a sudden weekly attack of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most actors are strangers likely to remain so. The only two known names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who present the only decent performances (Jones does not manage to cross the entire series - lucky woman). By the way, Ward is aging pretty well since the days of the "Thorn Birds". <br /> <br /> The underlying thread of the plot - the murder of the father of the heroine wrongfully convicted of the murder of her father, but is released after six years in the slammer - is lying for so long and is so quickly concluded that you will not care who will do it. There is a lot of "wet" sex, several murders and all kinds of rude behavior - hardly any of them are interesting or credible. Most actors are not particularly attractive and are certainly not talented. The writing and staging are on par with the actors. <br /> <br /> If you stick to the end, the postcard is a hoot (very minor). <br /> <br /> DO YOU CONSIDER?
