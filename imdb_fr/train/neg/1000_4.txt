The plot for the descent, if we can really call it intrigue, has two remarkable events. One towards the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events may represent 5% of the total movie time. All I mean and everything in between is basically the director's desperate effort to write the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I'm not troubled by rocky scenes - but if you expect me to spend 60 minutes of hazy / dark scenes (literally) without ANY scenario, you have something else to come. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely ruined here. And no, she is not naked, not even in the NC-17 version I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw and want to watch "Descent", take a nap instead - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
