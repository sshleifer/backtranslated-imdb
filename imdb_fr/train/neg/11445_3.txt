I saw a lot of shit in my day, but damn it, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free screening in New York the other night. I only hope they will show this fun version to paying customers. The big bursts of laughter were sparse, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were at best one-dimensional. A hilarious scene with Adam Samberg is to be emphasized. It was priceless and it was the only scene I really laughed at. Apart from that, I can only remember chance and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I was expecting more of that. But in short, I certainly would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this movie.
