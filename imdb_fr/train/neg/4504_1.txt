A slow, tedious and one-dimensional film! Good casting with dialogues clich√©s, story boring and direction without soul of Mr. Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution in the Asian continent lacks heart, new perspectives and depth. The main character does not seem in his place because of his tiny phisic and dummy contact lenses. The lexicon used by geishas seems forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure to educational methods. The story lasts over and over again for hours trying to convince you that this Asian girl with a flat and boring chest is the ultimate Geisha, she says in the movie "She is destined to become a legend". The film is simply boring, it is beautiful to watch, it contains some interesting moments as far as you can find out for cigarretes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger, you will not believe the message and this girl does not fulfill her task! Borin, boring, skip it!
