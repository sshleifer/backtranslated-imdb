Basically, what we have here is nothing more than a remake of the hilarious horror of the 1970s kitsch classic Death Line, which ironically resembled this shoemaker, also partially filmed in the disused metro station. Aldwych. This film contains essentially the same plot: murderous zombies killers in the tunnels looking for lost passengers who missed the last train - the originality is not strong point. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the strong points are sorely lacking. The gore goes from the poor to the useless, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never really explained, because it seems little more than an underdeveloped plot device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with a thin The scenario that a lot of tunnels and shouting from time to time, in fact, she was pretty much everyone in this movie, upset by a little dog and a pack of tame rats. <br /> <br /> If scary movies shot in the London Underground are your bag or you just want to play "locate the place of the tube", take them to DVD as soon as you encounter problems. If you're looking for a classic horror, get a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a quality film, well written and played, you will have to change trains. .....
