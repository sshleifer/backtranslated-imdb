Slashers ..... well if you like horrors it's really worth seeing, otherwise do not worry.It is quite obvious that this movie has an extremely low budget, For example, it seems that the whole movie has been turned into a warehouse somewhere, and on many occasions you will see the shadow of the microphone boom and the camera from the camera shadow, believe me, you do not need to look for them Also try to ignore the nerdy actors, if that's how you call them !! Some people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive one night in a big labyrinth, because they are 3 killers in freedom and the one who lives in the end gets richer. Now, there's something in this movie that keeps you from watching and you rarely find that with a horror of cheap budget these days, for example, when I looked at it, I thought about myself I would not mind trying this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. anyway I recommend you to watch and make your own idea.
