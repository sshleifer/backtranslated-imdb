I managed to capture that with the help of MST3K, and oh my god, even with the riffing, this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose skills with a camera could be mastered by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The strong points (the little bit there was) came from special effects, which were "OK". The role for most was also "OK"; Although nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B movies I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is terribly bad, the work of the camera often seems to be put the cameraman on roller skates and pushed him. The story (if you can call it that) is so pierced that it's almost funny, it never really explains why hell has survived, or needs human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is confused on a stupid plan. The highlight of the film (if there is one) is absolutely laughable. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
