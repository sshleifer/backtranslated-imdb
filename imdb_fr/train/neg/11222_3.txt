Cybil Richards directs another erotic masterpiece of the Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (wearing a silver outfit) will destroy all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tapes and she likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and set on a beautiful soundtrack (at least for this kind of film). The actors are largely awful and above all very average. Jacqueline Lovell herself is extremely attractive and, between the visualization of sex files, she manages to expose his chest and grope a little lower. She is also part of a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. Here, she looks super naked but is actually much more attractive in her silver outfit telling the "drama". Absolutely no movie with Lovell and soundtrack, the only real features that redeem you. Poor even for Surrender production and clearly a new reduced budget for them too.
