This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that jump right in my eyes: 1. The woods looked more like hills in Los Angeles with some trees and scrub. Not scary whatsoever. If you're shooting in Southern California, Big Bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever known. All possible lines in the film were unoriginal, clich√© or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lame), the name of the clown is "killer clown" (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest anyway? Was it the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting game. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shit lines and poor quality. The worst aspect from a distance was the moment when, randomly, we sent back that fat foreign girl undressing for a photo. It's a very long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy, but she was NOT. In addition, and it was one of the few enjoyable moments of the movie for me, this tool was supposed to be "sporty". For example, when he gets bored in the movie, he catches some stones and starts making curls with them. Then, later, he is supposed to run for the clown and he is immediately clear with his race very "girl", that he is far from being sporty. Oh, and to the girl who played Kat, God stop singing. The song you sang for the credits makes me want to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this film, I would at least recommend looking at the special items. The group of lascars who made this film speaks of it as if it were a truly original story. In fact, one of the girls says that she let some of her friends read the script and none of them could predict the end. Apparently, she hangs out with special kids.
