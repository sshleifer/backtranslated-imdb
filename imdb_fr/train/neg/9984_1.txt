It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the movie on television. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, 30 minutes later and I did not laugh once. The fact is that the film is over and I did not laugh to laugh. Please, someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
