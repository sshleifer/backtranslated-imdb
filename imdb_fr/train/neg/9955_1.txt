Everything is very beautiful to watch .. filming in Europe was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is usable. <br /> <br /> BUT THEN THAT! And the non-intrigue developed! And everything was downhill from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps saying how bored she is .. hello darling, you're not alone. When he does an imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide your face, it's so painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved in this movie, or better. question, why did it stink so bad? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have little enjoyment here. Perhaps he is supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
