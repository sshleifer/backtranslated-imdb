Documentary about the nomadic Persians making a perilous crossing of huge mountains to lead their herds to the grass. Watching this mute element in black and white, tainted in part by a score of oriental twink, twink, which could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it looks. The spectacular landscapes are lost on a small black-and-white screen, and the failure is total with regard to the plot. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this film, despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties alone are simply not interesting.
