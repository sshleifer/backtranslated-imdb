I love these actors, but they were lost in this film. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder, what were they thinking about accepting this crap ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called him in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you will probably like that too. I hated both. 3/10
