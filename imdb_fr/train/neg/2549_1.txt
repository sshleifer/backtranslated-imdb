my friend bought the film for 5 ?? (It's not even worth 1 cent), because they wrote it was like an American pie. but we would soon discover that there is a long way between American pie and this shit. it's not even a comedy, it's rather a very bad documentary. not only is the story bad, the picture and sound are equally void. they put alcohol, chicks, dwarves and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie, do not buy it, spend your money for something else, and better. if you are going to torture yourself, do not invite your friends unless you really hate a lot and want to get rid of them.
