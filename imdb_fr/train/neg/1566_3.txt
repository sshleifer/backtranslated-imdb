For the fan of the Beatles, the main value of this movie is simply to sit down and notice defects, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, extremely exaggerated events, missed people, timeline errors, misquoted quotes, incorrect clothes, place songs, and (ashamed shame) incorrect instruments and other boners that I just can not think of now. Defects are fast and furious, so you must be on your guard. <br /> <br /> I did not give you a "1", mainly because the film was shot in Liverpool and the actors (the Rain band) do their best (Lennon's character is credible and does a good job). In addition, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at a given moment and THAT counts for SOMETHING. <br /> <br /> So look at it for fun, but please do not consider it historically accurate.
