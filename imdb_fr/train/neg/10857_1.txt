Visit the movie's website, you have taken more time to do it than writing the screenplay for this movie. He could not be more off by boasting. Original story? Original? They had to find the scenario hidden between the Old Testament or face legal repression for this horn gesture. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a pot of earwax. Elegant cinematography? Oh yes, America's funniest home video look is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money for this title, so of course the sf are not really good, not a little bad sometimes, or just hilarious, but that's the story. makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories in one and all those brainless pieces of déjà vu and already accomplished.
