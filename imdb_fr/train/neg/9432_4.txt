"Unhinged" is a strange little movie, a forgotten slasher of the golden age of the genre. It's hard to write a satisfying review of this film just because this movie is so unique. His plot is rather exaggerated - three young women who go to a rock concert find themselves in a car accident and find themselves stuck in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her daughter's daughter. Soon, women realize that something is wrong when they hear strange breathing and noises coming from the attic. In addition to that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very very strange relationship, as they argue intensely in front of their dinner guest. The old mother goes so far as to describe her daughter as a bitch and slut and accuses him of passing stealthy guys at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when a girl finally decides to leave to find help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three stranded girls can act, especially the "main" girl. It's almost amazing to hear them line up in the same wood tone throughout the movie. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The movie is also pretty dull in some parts and really hangs out. The killings are horrible, but nothing we have seen before. However, as mentioned above, the film really wins points with its brilliantly disturbing and bloody end. It comes totally from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the camp classic "Sleepaway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is boring and suffers horrible acting and boring games. The isolated and scary mansion and the dark and disturbing lighting give the film a gritty realism, but it is quickly shattered when one of the characters tries to act. It may be worth it if you can hold it to the end, but I tell you that you'd better just make a quick advance to the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
