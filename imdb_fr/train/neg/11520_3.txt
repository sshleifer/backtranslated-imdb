I did not like this film at all.By one, I found it brutal and vulgar, without reason.I also felt that it was misogynous (with regard to women). Plus, the movie really did not seem to talk about anything, and I did not find any of the nice characters. In reality, there does not seem to be any reason for everything. Something I miss, but for me, this movie is a waste of time I could have done something more productive and enjoyable.I like to use my face as a pillow.James Garner is in this business, as the are C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones, and James Cromwell.all are wasted here and I'm sure John Harrison (from the last years of Three's Company) is also in the film, and it's nice to see her play a non-ditsy role. But aside from that, it can rise above the mediocre scenario. For me, Tank is a 3/10
