This film was great the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somewhere, Bill Murray has become a quirky black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson has become a grumpy Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, has become Carson, California. Instead of constructive conversations and silence in translation, we are not talking about anything in 10 articles that come close to boring. Instead of thoughtful and introspective characters like in Translation, we get characters that give useless advice on topics they have no idea about. How can a character who wears one hundred dollar t-shirts and who has never been inside a Target department store hope to give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think it stops him. If he does not give him advice on his clothes, he tells her what to eat. The most annoying part of the film was for me to see how much they were in a hurry to make an appointment. However, the characters always find time to do something else, whether it's washing the car, stopping at Arby or staying on the list. their 10 items or less lists of things they like and hate. I kept shouting at them, "Did not you say you had somewhere to go?" "What are you doing?" A minute ago, you were almost late, now you eat roast beef and meditate your life! " Until I saw this film, I never really understood how something could "insist on itself", but I think this film does just that, and undeservedly. The dialogue makes the characters tacky and unpleasant - except for the fact that I felt sorry for the two actors to have signed on this project.
