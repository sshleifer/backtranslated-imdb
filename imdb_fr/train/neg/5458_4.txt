This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they chose a young man of 19, probably not "to do it". It was impossible for them to have a boy of 12 or 13 years old: the love scenes would have made everyone bigger (if they had even been allowed to do it) - as it should be. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making him a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile does not necessarily have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I do not care about his education or his unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students for not being up to it. The reason given is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. It is understandable that she does not think rationally. We hope she understands her actions now. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she will take her medicine and think clearly. <br /> <br /> Even so, Penelope Ann Miller was quite convincing and was a perfect cast for the role.
