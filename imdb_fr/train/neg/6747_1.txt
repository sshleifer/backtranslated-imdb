Wow ... speechless about the realization of this film, I can not say more. The cover box of the local music store should have said it all ... only 6 actors / actresses who get lost on the set of Scream and decide to shoot a movie! <br /> <br /> The acting was apparently not in the budget, but they could afford nudity and beautiful actors! Style rather than substance almost makes its mark, with the exception of most of those failures of the class of actors who continually forget that a plot must go somewhere when reading this script. After only 4 or 5 murders committed by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing conspiracy around a murder club that the dumb actress thinks is a real club to which she can adhere car), you want to stab your hands with the closest pointy object to remind you to never be too excited about a film as good as this one. <br /> <br /> I can not find anyone to take it away. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of horror releases directly in video format, without any thought for the most part. Throw it away if you bought this.
