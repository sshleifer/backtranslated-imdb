When I come to the IMDb forums, I'm always tired of seeing an article "the worst movie of all time". After watching this * film *, I think I will soon create my own article! <br /> <br /> Opening Titles: awesome, a kind of lame zoom on a gas oven (yeah, focus on the fire = explosions = super action packed movie !!) <br /> > Actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a nice actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal, like the policeman he plays, is ... Beyond Words. The rest of the cast is ... well I do not know where these actors were hired but damn it! I bet my dog ​​would have been a much better actor than those !! <br /> <br /> The plot: Hijacking.original is not it ?? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion.I thought, well, cool !! At least there will be beautiful pyrotechnics ... I was completely wrong. The rest of the film is mainly filled with rent photos taken by the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are hilarious, the music is pure shit, the end is happy (I I mean, I was happy at the end because the film was finished !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well ). was about to take the film and burn it. Maybe next time I'm going to watch it ... (who ever said ???)
