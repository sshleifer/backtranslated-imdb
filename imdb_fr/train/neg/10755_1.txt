I can not really think of the redemptive features of this totally bad rendering on Asimov as the art direction. Forget the disaster of product placement, Will Smith's unconvincing performances and gigantic intrigues. It was not only laughable and painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mix of production values ​​inspired by MTV and extremely deplorable dialogues, probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a pity that science fiction could have been so difficult after Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (from the same director). This one really belongs to the list of the last 100. Really horrible.
