The plot of 'House of Games' is what she has the strongest: a famous author and psychologist gets fucked by a gang of scribblers, but discovering the nasty part of herself who loves the thrill of this she does, she finally takes her revenge. That's about it, but someone has to take responsibility for it by acting like puppets. It has to be Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and relatively regular career in television and film, so she can not perform so badly all the time. She is supposed to go from a tense, cool and controlled professional to a calculator, a quick and fun lady, as shown by the change of the beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days, including underwear) to a summer dress with flowers. But everyone seems to speak his lines in the same way cut and precise; I imagine that Mamet wants to make sure not to miss a syllable of his scintillating script. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense that he is likely to create. Sometimes, "House of Games" loses all connection with the way humans behave or talk to each other, and simply becomes a mechanism to unveil the plot. The vibes'n'oboe faux jazz jazz soundtrack does not help either. The end result is that the only fun you have is to guess the result, and the sooner you do it, the sooner you'll get tired of two-dimensional robotic performance. And they smoke too !!!
