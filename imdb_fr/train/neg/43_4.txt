This unpleasant video was originally banned in Britain and allowed last November without cuts. <br /> <br /> She introduces October 1979 playboy Playmate Ursula Buchfellner. The opening is shuttling between Buchfellner and misty images of the jungle. I'm not sure what it was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) managed to spend time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) constantly moaned. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell and Laura rushes into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a nasty video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very well undressed. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, who has been captured now. They spend time having sex and do not see the danger approaching. Guts, someone? Big fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of foreheads, some thrills of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line "They tore her heart", which is hilarious if you see the movie.
