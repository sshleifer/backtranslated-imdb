It simply should not have been done. It's predictable and clich√©. The chemistry on the screen that made the first "My Girl" so captivating is nowhere else, and the game of actors as a whole is frozen and forced. Writing also leaves a lot to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines such as "revolve around a barbaric custom" are simply shocking. Where "My Girl" has caused real feelings of sadness and truly fun moments, like so many sequels, "My Girl 2" is trying to recreate those emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably. Maybe I'm hard on this movie because of the quality of the first movie, but honestly, it insults the quality of the original with the kind of maneuver that this down payment serves. This must surely be close to "Son of the Mask" as one of the worst suites of all time. In both cases, the old adage sounds right; "if it is not broke, do not fix it".
