Having nothing better to do, I decided to check "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed). <br /> <br /> The silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. They actually looked like animatics (these approximate drawings that artists later use to complement CGI effects, add more detail, make movement smoother, etc.) Absolutely awful dinosaurs, which is the only reason you will probably want to stay that way. <br /> <br /> The factor who redeemed was the charming Dichen Lachman in Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget had been increased and convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the actors and the team got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was shot.
