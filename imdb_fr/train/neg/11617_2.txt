This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and downright useless. It makes me shudder to think that there are people who would like to watch it. Without telling the story, it is the reaction of a young boy to his new sister, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the duration of this film, the viewer is subjected to one of the most disturbing child behaviors imaginable. Adding an insult to injury, at the end of this film, there is absolutely no real result, except the realization of pure evil in the hands of a child who has foiled a whole group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, no justice, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what's going on around them. Frankly, I did not like watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who love horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well played, the story itself is so disturbing that looking at it was equivalent to a 90-minute wait in the waiting room of a dentist, in anticipation of a painful dental procedure.
