Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl to whom James Cagney showed a grapefruit in THE ENNEMY PUBLIC. She will not be remembered for this weird little story about a Hood girl who discovers that her past will always be with her. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it seems a little old-fashioned for 1931, almost as if you were watching the famous LIGHTS OF NEW YORK in 1928.
