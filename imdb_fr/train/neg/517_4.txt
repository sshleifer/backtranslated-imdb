"The return of Chandu" is remarkable, so to speak, of Bela Lugosi's cast as a hero rather than a villain. Why he even had the girl. <br /> <br /> The story as such involves Ubasti's Black Magic cult that attempts to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delectable Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice. to revive their former leader who looks like Nadji. Lugosi, in the role of Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the wicked. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor is doing his best with limited resources and extensive archive footage. Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the gigantic gates used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes. The acting is mostly frightful. The actor who plays the high priest (I think Lucien Prival), for example, uses this pronunciation inspired by the acting trainer who was so common in the first talkies. The less we say about others, the better. <br /> <br /> That's why Lugosi agreed to take on roles in independent quickies at this stage of his career, as he was still a bank star at Universal at the time. Maybe it was because in this case he had to play the hero and look for the girl, who knows. As his career began to regress in the late 1930s, this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than an exception. <br /> <br />
