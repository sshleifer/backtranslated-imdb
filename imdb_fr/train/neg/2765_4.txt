How was this film made with a supposed budget of $ 70 million and without being completely redeveloped, it's beyond me. The scenario and the dialogue are beyond amateurism. The characters say things that no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that have been said before. Nobody seems to be rooted in the real world. The acting is good because writing is such a failure ... but many actors in supporting roles actually drive production down. The hair of the hero probably should have got their own credit, they were so strangely attractive ... not to mention the fact that they gave one of the best performance of the photo. Finally, for a film about L.A. besieged by giant reptiles, this film is terribly boring. Too bad! If you see this, your mind will be constantly racing, imagining ways to take the SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it would not have taken much.
