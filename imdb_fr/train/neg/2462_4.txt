Well, I like gore in this movie - it's really disturbing. Anyone who has been to the dentist will know why. The story is not so bad, Corbin Bersen's motivations are more meaningful than in most horror movies. of the day it's still a bad horror movie. So it's about whether you like that kind of thing or not. I tried to watch more, but it was exactly the same as this movie. Do not forget that if you like people tortured at the dentist, this movie is for you!
