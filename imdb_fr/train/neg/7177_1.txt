Since I liked the original "Caligula", even with all its faults, I must say that this remake trailer was abominable. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich in this lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick. The decor does not look Roman at all ... it looks like the mansion of a Hollywood mansion in Hollywood, and the Roman costumes look like cheap shit you buy in a suburban costume shop. <br /> <br /> This "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a 50-year-old Hispanic woman totally terrified, as if she did not know it's a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> The action must be one of the worst I've ever seen, with most replicas I hear being random actors shouting "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as loud and obnoxious as possible. <br /> <br /> The random sex scenes also filled 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes of notable actors / actresses like Gerard Butler (who plays shadows for every three and a half seconds ) doing nothing but looking uncomfortable or going all the way with their minimal lines, just slide them down with the ridiculousness of their performance. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's one part is that she looks like her usual fucking fucking crack backing a door mumbling about the moon or something. You can not know it because it's drunk or loud or just mumbling idiotically. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just boring ... laughs randomly and screams in a way that irritates you. <br /> <Helen Mirren ... she was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I especially like "love" (and out of love, I mean to hate) Ennia's line, "Caligola ... j00 no maki me * something incoherent * .... * something that looks like j00nalo * "It is also incredibly arrogant to say the four of Caligula The reign of the year was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's the worst, the most exploitative, the most arrogant of the so-called arrogant shit, called "art" that I've ever seen. Even though Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not have appeared or given his name for that damn heap, no matter how much they paid for it (unless it's a trillion yen). The worst trailer of all time.
