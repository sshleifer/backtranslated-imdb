A well-made entry in the genre of serial killers that unfortunately sank in its own pretensions to be really satisfactory. Willem Dafoe is superb as a New York detective trying to find what appears to be an imitator using the same Renaissance-style killing techniques used in a series of murders he had solved. years ago. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and they have very good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to tie the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of a previous victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of visual arts broker / mentor with Dafoe ... it's a bit difficult to assume, though Stormare is never dull of course. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Quickly look for Harry Deborah, Dafoe being less than his next neighbor.
