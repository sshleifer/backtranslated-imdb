The landscape is pretty and the dog is cute. Apart from that, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is pleasantly great, as usual, but the scenario is so horrible that even he is doing badly. The plot is meaningless, the dialogue is stupid and there are many small mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
