First, I was expecting another hero too - a fantastic piece of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I guess it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Hero are in HoFD: beautiful landscapes, fascinating cinematography and sincere play I mean, if you can not understand a word they say, without the subtitles, but you care - it's good to act) <br /> <br /> What was wrong? What begins with a political intrigue is lost in a love story. Even worse, it's a love triangle that looks like a soap opera. You have three characters who I suppose fall in love with each other - for no good reason. This film is falling apart after the release from prison (I fell asleep about forty minutes). It's almost as if they had changed their writer at that time. The rest of the movie explains how a character is "like the wind". Ick. In addition, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the bottom parts of action. It's not unique to this genre, but as the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and when the fighting breaks out, it's really not so good. The beginning catches you, but then this film lacks essence.
