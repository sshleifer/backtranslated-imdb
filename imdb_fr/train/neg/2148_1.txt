Spoilers possible, maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: dreams come true" is one of the worst films ever made. First, the film was shot at the peak of the Disney sequel. It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which hindered their classics from the original movie. (Disney also directed "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I will drop this subject because their original movies were never really classics. ") Let me go from before and say I'm a big supporter of good Disney movies and I love Disney's original "Cinderella" movie, but the sequel to "Cinderella" was a waste of time, so Cinderella's character in the sequel was so different of the original girl I grew up looking at ... In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving.The new Cinderella had very exotic moments with a contemporary phrasing: "I will do this banquet as I want "You say that the new Cinderella (as I affectionately affected her) says," Ewww! "Is anti-Cinderella, I try to find the best of people, but in the following, Anastasia, one of the half-sisters, is good! Why? They did everything to make Lady Tremaine and Drizella horrible members of the poor little Anasta sia's family. My question to the world: did the people of Disney look at the original "Cinderella" by doing this sequel? Well, that certainly does not seem to be. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was as violent towards Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this film. In the first, Anastasia was diabolical. In the second, she is good. You can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney will realize that this film, among others, is ashamed of Walt Disney. Now that Michael Eisner is gone, maybe things will start to take shape around the House of the Mouse.
