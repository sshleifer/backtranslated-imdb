I hate this program: not only is the concept itself ridiculous, but it does everything possible to be achievable (something that has been left out of similar programs "I admit it" as Muder: She wrote). <br /> <br /> Sigh. Why can not writers ever be smart enough in this program to present evidence that sticks and gets a decision in court? <br /> <br /> Go ahead: After X years of cases being unsolved, why ALL SUSPECT, EACH EPISODE * CONFESS * it (damn!) to a murder that would otherwise remain unresolved? <br /> <br /> I bet the police want the criminals to be that good sportsman: "officer, you're a brilliant man - I guess if you've found enough to convince you that I did it, I can confess it and make it easier for you in court, what can I say, good policeman. "<br /> <br /> An absolute dog ** and an insult to those who have enough brains for hearing about IQ
