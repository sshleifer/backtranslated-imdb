I liked how it started with decent special effects, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There were some pretty impressive landscapes. However, the film gets lost quite early in a very stupid dialogue while the men all try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius". <br /> <br /> Looking at this in the 90s after a long absence, It was fun to see Francis again, an actress who's been doing TV shows since the release of this movie ... and still plays. It was also interesting to see Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), young and I would not have recognized if I had not heard that voice. <br /> <br /> I saw half of it The movie before the boredom is almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to sleep. I appreciated them to remake this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. It is an overestimated film in which the "elites" think so "heavy" and "that makes you think". It's anything. It just seemed "smart" because the rest of the science fiction movies of the 50's was so stupid! <br /> <br /> Some if the first scenes would have been great on a big screen, which I did not have at the beginning of this writing. Maybe another look - this time on the widescreen 2.35: 1 transfer would make me change that exam.
