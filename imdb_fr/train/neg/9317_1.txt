I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said that the reason for his price was so low because the disc had been scratched, but he failed to mention that the reason for his price was because the film was a mediocre effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton. in a video of a hotel room house. Speaking of personal videos, since when is it fair to release them in the form of films - I mean, films that employ actors, technicians and writers, and so on? - more now - just gather your friends and lame ideas for the weekend, produce the production with a budget of £ 8.00 and ask someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then to slam it on the shelves, for a little poor sap (me), to bring home alone despair. But here's the decisive point - I quickly went through most of this file and threw it aside, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, while watching a horror film of Darren Day 'Hellbreed' (£ ​​1.99 to take home and avoid another blockbuster). Now, this movie gave "Grim Weekend" an "Exorcist" appearance, so I slapped it to catch up on some of the moments listed on IMDb's wonderful paintings, which viewers found hilarious. Indeed, once I overcame the misery, the pain and the horror of doing Grim Weekend as if nothing had happened, I could enjoy, savor and put deep down fun things. And there are many. Check the boards. Then check the movie. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
