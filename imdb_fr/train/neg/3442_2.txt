I rented this film only because the cover I liked. However, as soon as the film started, I had regrets. It seems they used a video camera at home to shoot this film and let a young child do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly shapes and faces to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have put it myself and do it better. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, I had the impression that he had very good ideas, but because of dark lines and in some cases acting, they were eclipsed. There was no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit down because of everything because it caused me physical pain but I always finished what I was starting so I took a deep breath and let it continue . Really 98 minutes of my life lost. <br /> <br /> I would like you to avoid the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched "Haunted Boat" and find something more entertaining. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but it was a big disappointment. I thought nothing could get worse after "Terror Toons", but it made me reconsider. Left to his style. <br /> <br /> * on ***** (The star is for ideas to have their worst fears coming for them)
