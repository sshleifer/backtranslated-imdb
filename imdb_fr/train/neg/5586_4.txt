Man To Man strives to be a good movie: he has his heart in the right place, he aspires to be epic and contains a message that everyone will certainly appreciate. But there are also some of the problems in this picture. He strives so much to be good and to convey his message that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. It is therefore fair that the images used by this image are simplistic - Man To Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but hammers the message in his head. Joseph Fiennes shows it well in his role: he does his best to appear concerned, truly moved and for all the other emotions that you can express with the only facial expression that his repertoire can offer. Add to that that the film is too long and that it loses its speed towards the end, you would easily be brought to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it's entertaining, there are humorous scenes and super star Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it to humanist masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will leave the theater with satisfaction. He tries to catch your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and does it most of the time.
