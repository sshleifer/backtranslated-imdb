This esteemed production has its fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad criticism of 'Mary Reilly', Moby Dick is like a painting, but more slowly. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the philosophical foundations of a film "production" are never a great film, it is rather to replace the lack of strong guiding idea (in this case, a transfer of books to film) by a list of totally atomized, non-dynamic but dazzling concepts in order to deceive viewers into thinking they have seen greatness. As viewers and critics are prone to crack for it, the Oscars follow, fueling the entire silly equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all these critics have found. Moby Dick is incredibly uninvolved. The actors are conscientiously reciting essays on Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all that can not answer, and none of them absorbs the least bit. It's dramatically inert. It does not build. In narrative terms, Moby Dick (as a film) is just a learned achievement in search of a real story. After half an hour, I whispered, "Oh, great ... another oath ... another 4-minute soliloquy!" <br /> <br /> In the failed effort to get involved, it's a beautiful old-fashioned showcase. A lot of gray hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a god of gold. (!) <br /> <br /> We know that we are looking at a great director when he appropriates this means of expression rather than trying to reproduce the sensation of the paintings and the palette of someone. another, or respectfully embalm a classic like Huston does here. The paintings and books are good but they are different mediums. A movie like this fails to understand that a piece of really good shit (Village of the Damned) is better in many respects than an unbearable piece of culture. This is the film school Eat your vegetables. <br /> <br /> We appreciate the work that had to be done to make the film, but not the narration. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting. recording songs as a means of structuring work and various efforts at sea; and the technology of whaling. And that does not call for a movie of more than two hours.
