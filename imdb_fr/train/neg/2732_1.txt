When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" was broadcast last season, I was delighted. Scrubs, I thought, does something clever and unique about the concept of a clip show. Instead of replaying a sequence, they replay the jokes in a conscious way and really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. A season later, they succumbed to what almost every sitcom inevitably do, the clip shows ... and it looked like it had been designed by the experienced child. Dr. Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors have been, because it does not appear until "My Long Goodbye", 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig takes too much effort to maintain the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. Who knows why it was inserted here, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of the episodes that have been aired in the last year. <br /> <br /> Three seconds clips, along with background music, is an extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not a prime time TV episode.
