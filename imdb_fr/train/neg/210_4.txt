You may not want to compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original hip hop. Beat Street has a lot of the original artists of the early Hip Hop, but it was clearly explained that this could be their big hit, of course for some and that's fine. But if you consider that as an original hip hop culture, you are mistaken. It is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Look for the first two films I mentioned. They convey the gritty character of life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even delusional. This is probably because while the story, the acting, the dialogue and the direction are all terrible, music and dance are what people like about it. I love dancing, but at the time, I thought electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when, around 1986, a new generation of now-classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Jungle Brothers Mc, Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still do not like most of the beats of this movie and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style does not have a lot of history, but the music is great and authentic. Of course, tastes are different and that's fine. As far as I'm concerned, this film is a garbage can, apart from break dance and some of the music. I can not give a rating higher than 4 out of 10.
