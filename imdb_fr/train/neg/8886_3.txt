Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer spoilers to this film because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there, it's like watching the paint dry. The acting also seems very mediocre and reminds me of the old black and white films of the Maoist era occasionally broadcast on Chinese television by day. Although it is difficult to say with the female role, Yuwen, the story apparently does not require that she walks like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the faded star Gong Li, who has somehow earned a reputation as a good actress in Western countries for scowling all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Blue Kite" movie was a much better movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that the spring in a small town was set in the late 40s. Unlike Blue Kite, the fact that this film takes place in a period of upheaval does not affect the Intriguing in itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing but a scenic setting. Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to take advantage of the popularity of Chinese films in the West and seduce a foreign audience unable to differentiate between a "beautiful" "deep" or "hypnotic" film and a simply tedious film. and without substance. <br /> <br /> If a movie fits the description of "overestimated", that's it. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the situation of the Chinese film industry.
