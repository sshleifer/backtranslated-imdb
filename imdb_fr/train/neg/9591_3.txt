If you have read the original novel, like me, you will probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of anachronisms of the 1980s that attempts to create a "period piece" setting in the late 1950s and does not pay homage to this period, nor even paying tribute to it, the American monstrosity of "Dirty Dancing" resembles that of 1963, except that the film was a financial success despite a writing also amateur. In addition to "looking too much into the 1980s", the characters were modified, reorganized and minimized to the point that their only characteristics in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial aspect and, of course, their appearance. names: Suze is transformed from the flying ex-girlfriend of the narrator and promiscuous negrophile who is willing to marry an old queen locked up for money (to her own admission in the first pages) into an unhappy and naive archetype from "Eve" seduced by glory and glamor, exploited and somehow turned into a mock marriage by her boss, who, surprisingly, did not get a Van Dyke hairstyle and pointed. She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The character of Big Jill, an apparently butch-like lesbian "fop like" in her mid-twenties who acts as a pimp for a group of young and domed lesbians, and one of the most closer to the narrator, giving the narrator a frank sense of wisdom, is reduced to a sort of "extra-naming" with only a few lines to throw and tons of comic outfits. <br /> <br /> The Fabulous Hoplite, a young gay man and another intimate friend of the novel's narrator, is also destroyed in the film. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad minor character, but in the film, he played to be optimistic and strangely fiery despite the sordid neighborhood, and the dismay of his marriage with the narrator's mother seems, for all practical purposes, ignored. <br /> <br /> In his favor, the music (for what it is) is well composed and we must give credit to the production and writing teams for taking a line of the book ("... some days, they write 1950s musicals ... ") as an inspiration for writing A musical comedy, but in the world of bad musicals, it is one of the worst executed in the pack. Unlike Shock Treatment or Starstruck, the elements of the crucial plot are treated as afterthought. Unlike _The Apple_, there is a jerky and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogues. <br /> <br /> You really can not blame the feeling that it's "too 1980s" because it was created in the 1980s. The cinematic version of _Annie_, released in 1981, makes a a wonderfully well executed tribute to the look and feel of New York in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture a very realistic aspect of the 1980s, albeit with a reduced budget in 2003 (although this is not explicitly defined in the 1980s, those who have lived this decade can not deny that the film "really feels like in the 1980s"). Clearly, it was possible to get something right, especially given the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK, but it looks like its appearance and appearance are not so obvious, so as the processing of the source material, which is downright disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you have not read and you do not intend to read the novel, you could enjoy this rustic anachronism of the 1980s, giving a shameful parody of Soho London's modernist jazz set of the late 1950s. I can really see what the editorial team was trying to do, but it certainly could have done better. With Boy George as a last name and musicians and MÃ©tis groups on the charts in 1986 in the UK, they certainly did not need to let off steam like they did. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the scriptwriters ended up doing what the book and the film critically criticized: a group of adults was spitting shit and treating their teen audience in the same way. fools to make money fast.
