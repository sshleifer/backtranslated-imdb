I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as Nightstalker, which dealt with the legend of Wendigo. So I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man was I was wrong. The whole film creates that feeling of events about to happen that will be scary and frightening, but then delivers a very simplistic story of revenge and murder on the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - no! This film has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It's harder and harder to believe what Hollywood is proposing about scary movies, because they do not produce anything original and sinister anymore. . What idiots pay for such a film to be made? Go back to the drawing table and do something useful with the millions of dollars you have to throw away.
