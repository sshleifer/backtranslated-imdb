This cowardly and offensive film had first of all intrigued me. The characters are the young, dispossessed, familiar men who are often seen hanging out in an annoyed seaside town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert a monster who embarks on a journey of cannabis and ecstasy and mingles with the bad crowd. Clay seems to believe in the "madness of reefer" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much real life experience this young director has. Nobody can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us the message that young Britons are out of control. A very subtle link is established with the Iraqi insurgents; during the uselessly graphic rape, we are subject to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of male peer groups pushed to its limits. The young suicide bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's despicable representation of Clay. Clay assumes that men simply can not help but perpetrate terrible acts of violence. It is a marvel that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that defend propaganda that divides so much, while in London, we are still shocked by recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I'd love it to be his last.
