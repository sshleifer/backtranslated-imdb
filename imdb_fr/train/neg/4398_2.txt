Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I've enjoyed so much throughout their careers, and that's the only reason they chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regretted it! These two great actors humble themselves throughout their career by performing a number of irrelevant skits, unimaginative and extremely kitsch (which is not bad in itself), which are supposed to make people laugh, but do not do not do it. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his film by playing the main role. I can not think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since. I would recommend avoiding this movie unless you want to get your opinion on both actors.
