What a festival of snoring. <br /> <br /> Of all the bits of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to redo and update, this is by far one of the most useless. It was a totally useless show in the first place, and we REALLY do not need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> It does not matter the bigotry and the sexism inherent in the system since the beginning, so many advances have socially, since the series took place, that all its meaning (if it had one) has been lost. <br /> <br /> What is also the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he is not overweight?
