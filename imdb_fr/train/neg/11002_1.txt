Hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offer everyone- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we spent money to praise this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all the bull of the movie we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this waste on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I usually avoid those who are nil, but I fell into this one. We have since beaten the con who suggested to praise him, and his privileges as moviegoers have been revoked. There is nothing really funny in this movie ... even the scene of "Dickman's adventures" was at best sophomoric .. Color me p *** ed. I thought the value of the production was shit for an important reason ... no ... it was just nil. NEVER LOOK AT THIS! for whatever reason. Even with large amounts of illegal stuff, this movie would not be funny. That says a lot. Please, for the sake of all that is holy, if you love your sanity, never look at this movie. There are many stupid, useless and worthless things to name a few. But the main goal was to be offensively funny, it's a dismal failure. Crash and burn ....
