Oh yes, in the 1980s, at the time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a host of other action stars hid in an isolated jungle sweeping commies. At the time, I could not believe how films like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Have made money at the box office, they are crazy action with a rather decent film agenda of the wing and they have very poorly dated. TROMA`S WAR is a pun on these kinds of movies, but you have to wonder if they needed an identity theft? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks sophistication, although it clearly shows that there is no real difference between right-wing and left-handed tyrants, and that it sometimes looks more like a z-grade movie than a shipment. Maybe it is?
