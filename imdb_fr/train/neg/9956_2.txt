I made a special effort to see this film and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the scenario looks promising and the choice of actors gives hope. I loved Pacino in Scent of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other 70s / 80s movies. But I had forgotten how much dialogue can play an important role in a film, and in this film they are absolutely pure. The filming locations were also appealing, but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogs brought the whole thing to a sub-zero level. On top of that, I am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and it says something !!). I was really expecting better from this movie and I was very disappointed to have been so let down.
