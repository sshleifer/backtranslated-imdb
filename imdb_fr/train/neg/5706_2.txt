This film is like the thousand films "cat and mouse" that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really describes a great class of movies.) There is the passionate and wise main character, his clumsy but well-meaning companion with his misplaced attempts at humorous comments, but soon softened beautiful lady who triggers the inevitable love story "improbable", the relatives taken hostage, and of course the diabolical opponent carefree with his brutal henchmen. Everyone has already seen tons of these movies, and "National Treasure" looks like any of them, with only a slightly modified package. Every turn of history was easily predictable (and I can assure you that I am not the most powerful tool in the hangar). I'm pretty tired of feeling trapped for money after coming out of a Hollywood movie theater, and if you've ever felt that way, consider my warning; stay miles from this movie.
