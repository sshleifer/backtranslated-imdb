The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece. The Redford film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers dropping a fall and their double dating in a shabby bar that has not even been mentioned in the story. The encryptor, Brad Pitt, who tries to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius from the outside, turns out to be laughable or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some casting scenes of flies are beautiful. In addition, Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were supposed to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is unfortunate, because Maclean loved the women of his story and explained it, even poetic.
