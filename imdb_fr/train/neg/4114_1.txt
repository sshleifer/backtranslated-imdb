There are big philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why do they make so bad movies ??? The premise is absurd. The game is one-dimensional. The special effects are exaggerated. And the film is an endless battle among the most unhealthy shots ever produced by Hollywood. But then, if they had had good shots, everyone would be dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it did not happen that way. Trying to turn it off several times, I hung to see how serious it could become. I'm glad I did it because (SPOILER?) The last line is the supreme stupidity of this dismal and dark scenario. It is not even worthy of a second status in a third pass in low season. In addition to the horrors of the film, I am deeply concerned about its impact on young audiences. Americans crush such things and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. It's a really banal cinema on the Brobdingnagian scale!
