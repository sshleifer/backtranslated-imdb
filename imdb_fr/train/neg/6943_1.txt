This film is profoundly silly. A man wants revenge for a crime - but when he decrees revenge - a video camera is directed at him all the time. Which man with a brain cell in his head would stay there and do that for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this scenario can never happen, except with a person unable to dress up destroyed for me, but he has become more stupid !!! <br /> <br /> I think the writers have serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them miss parcel holes, you can drive an armored battalion <br /> <br /> TERRAIN: a man tries to avenge the death of his relatives, but in the middle of the plot, something goes wrong, then the unexpected is revealed. <br /> <br /> If only those who wrote this story were not stupid enough to write completely unrealistic scenarios that could never happen that way. I tell writers: ask for help for your serious mental problem.
