The TV show of the 1980s, updated with fresh female flesh and torrid language. "The dukes of Hazzard" passed me; it did not happen every time I was watching television in New York or California; or I probably would have looked. Yet somewhere (like the clips accompanying the updated 2005 version of this movie), I knew it was a fast orange Dodge Charger - and the "General Lee" is always ready. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of orange sage. The beautiful Jessica Simpson (Daisy) fills her shorts well - but even her exciting pink bikini can not beat the competition with a dormitory full of busty and bare-breasted students. The stupid conspiracy involves a graying Burt Reynolds (under the name of "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazzard County into an open pit mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
