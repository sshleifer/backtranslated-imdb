This film is a terrible waste of time. Even if it only lasts an hour and a half, it feels almost four o'clock. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and aimlessly. It is also a "horror" film that often takes place in broad daylight. My friend and I laughed a lot laughing while we were probably supposed to be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie has come out in so many countries. He can not be so strong in demand. <br /> <br /> The model Nicole Petty should remain true to the model, because although she is beautiful, she lost her accent so many times in this film, half the time she is British and half the time that she is American.
