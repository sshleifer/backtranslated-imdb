When I was a child, in the 1970s, a local theater organized children's mornings every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (does that mean you?). They showed this thing a year around Christmas. Friends and I went to see him. I was expecting a nice movie from Santa Claus. What I got was a terribly nicknamed movie and really scary. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the magician (do not ask me what these two are doing in the same movie) fighting Satan (a jester disguised as a devil with horns!). The pictures made me tremble in my seat. At first, I always found the scary father, so it did not help. The guy in Satan's suit did not help. But what REALLY horrified me was the wooden deer pulling Santa's sleigh. When he wrapped them up and the scary sound they made and the movements - I remember having nightmares about these things! All these years later, I still remember my release from this theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were scared of it too. I just saw an advertisement on TV and ALL those nightmares came back. This is a worrying and disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare the pants of any small child who sees it. Avoid this one - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets a 1.
