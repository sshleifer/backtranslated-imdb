In the opening scene of "Malta Story", MAGuinness was so much like Noel Coward that I was expecting her first words to be: "Some women need to hit regularly - like gongs" or something. such a world - tired good word.Despite his dialogue is a prose hardly mortal and even the Master would have had a hard time giving it life.In fact, Mr. Guinness walks in the picture as if he were looking for a focal point and would not manage to find one.And there lies the fatal weakness of the whole film. Similarly, Mr. J. Hawkins gives up early and ends up giving a performance of "Jack Hawkins" without an ounce of individuality. It could have been merged with a dozen British war movies. Many of the usual suspects of the early fifties present their schtick to very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to convince Malta to submit, just as it failed to put London on its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in front of the incessant danger has been recognized by the king and the island has been rewarded by the George Cross.A worthy subject that you might think for a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify the term "dignified" in its most condescending sense. It gives the appearance of having hastily tinkered to meet a deadline, perhaps before the actors lose the will to live.
