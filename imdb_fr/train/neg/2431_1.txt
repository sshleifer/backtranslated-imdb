As a Turk currently living in Sweden, I must admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if I never understand. I think Scandinavian actors work best in Hollywood. Last week, I watched a film called "The Polish Wedding" with a Polish friend and we both said it was the worst movie we've ever seen. Unfortunately, I was wrong, this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think everything is messy from the beginning. many bad actors except Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
