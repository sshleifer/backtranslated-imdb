We actually looked at it twice at the theater because we could not believe how it was the first time. Maybe we missed something ... no, what was missing was forgotten since the start of preproduction. In fact, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting at the time was now so much a disconnected junk food and a fuzzy head. <br /> <br /> So the initial problem with the movie was to decide to do it, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some superb exterior photographs are erased by the random placement of the camera in the interior shots. All actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks completely mortified - with the exception of Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unconscious to realize how much her performance is terrible. The dialogue is one, long, constant grinding. The scenes have no meaning from second to second and the links between them are non-existent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly, convinced that it says something profound. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to be funny. it's just awful. Gus Van Zant has made other exciting films that I encourage you to see. I'm glad he survived (and seems to have learned from) this mess.
