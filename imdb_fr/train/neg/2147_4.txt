The original is a relaxing watch, with truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the result, even if it is not the worst of the consequences of the DTV, totally lacks spark. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of history. As in the magical world of Belle, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical World, although slightly superior, always manages to spoil the story. Between thumbnails, we see the mice at work, and I personally think that the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella's habit of being a princess. This is the best because the mice here were the funniest. The worst vignette, when Jaq turns into human, is sometimes cute but lacks imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia fell in love, was also cute. The problem was that I could not imagine that Anastasia was friends with Cinderella, because I considered her as the meanest half-sister. It was also tainted by a rather ridiculous plot that Lucifer fell in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> Casual music was very pleasant to listen to. However, I hated the songs, they were really uninspired and nothing resembled Tchaikovsky's beautiful melodies from the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella, although always attentive, had lost her sincerity and much of her original charm, although she wears very pretty clothes. The Duke had some really fun moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, nor with Prudence and the King. As I said above, the mice represented the redeeming merit of the film because they alone contributed to the beauty of the film. I must also say that the animation is colorful and above average, and that the voice was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> In the end, a cute, although unoriginal, suite that has been ruined by the songs and a lack of a story. 4/10 for mice, dubbing, animation and some pretty dresses.
