Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, involved oneself ?? this movement felt like a bad date. Worse yet, the tedious direction of the art school - with heavy use of swirling shooting that becomes so exaggerated that it almost makes me vomit - keeps on screaming to be noticed. Add to that the thinnest plot and virtually no dialogue, and the movie begins to look like an epic 30 minutes. It gets worse: instead of dialogue, there are badly written comments, quotes and songs that comment too clearly on the characters. Opera music really strong too. Blame all the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited to celebrity. He and the other actors have tender erotic moments. Even these begin to be boring after 5 minutes, however, and one wonders if the director audition for a porn job at Bel Ami. The incredible architecture of the university campus in Mexico City is a source of inspiration. How is it that American universities are so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. Want to use the quick scan button? a lot.
