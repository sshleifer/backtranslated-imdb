While working in a video store, I found it my solemn duty to talk about the worst films I've ever seen and to tell my friends and colleagues about them. During a day of particularly heated debates on the worst movie, my friend challenged me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the entire movie while claiming that my previous choice was the worst movie of all time, he would watch it. I lost. I think even though I made better videos than that in high school, these were true feats of a young genius. This film lacked not only what appeared to be a production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it's surprisingly clear), but also in the acting game (wood, hollow and pathetic does do not scratch the surface), as well as just bad movie feeling. I remember a scene where I heard smashing glass. Suddenly, I remembered bad plays in high school (I know I speak too much of high school here, but this film seemed very young), both in terms of scenery, which seemed far too false, but also as if people were reading the lines of the script, not really sure what was going on. My criticism does not do justice to this film because I can not describe how horribly horrible the time I spent watching it. It is almost ironic to do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
