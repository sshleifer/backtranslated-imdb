Disappointing film. The performance of the actors is weak. The decorations are good, could have been better. The story is also weak. The fight sequences are awful. The sounds and the quality of the film are trashy. The story of the Kazakh people has been very badly told. This film should have included more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And should also have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic. I do not understand. Since when Hispanics play the Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. The director of Czekh is excused, since he is not nomadic, he can not know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
