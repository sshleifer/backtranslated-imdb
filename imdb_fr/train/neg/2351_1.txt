I do not know how we managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was hammered and amateurish, the story was old and the development of the plot (or lack thereof) has always had eyelids sagged less than half of each episode. That's about all there is to say about it, because it really lacked a substance of any kind. <br /> <br /> How can you like shit like that? It's really stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it further ... It's as if some of you were blindly looking at this kind of junk simply because you like the appearance of some actors, or because, for some reason, you have not seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. <br /> <br /> I come .. forget. This show sucks, and luckily he left forever. I wish they could work to demolish The O.C once and for all.
