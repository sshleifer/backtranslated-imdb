.... may seem far-fetched .... but there was really a real life story .. of a man who had an affair with a woman, who discovered where he and his new wife were staying, and she killed the woman, making believe in a murder rape ....... <br /> <br /> in her delusion, she had told everyone that the man had asked her to to marry .. so she left her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> The last time I heard that she was in a psychiatric facility, the security prison .... <br /> <br /> she still wore the "engagement ring". that she bought for herself ... and told everyone that he had bought her for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,,, and the murder took place in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There There was even a feature article in the magazine "People" ... In the spring of 1988, I want to say on page 39. I remember when I was in college at the time, and one of my colleagues had met the individual at the security hospital ....
