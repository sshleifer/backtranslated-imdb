"Shadrach" was not my favorite movie type. I found it too sentimental and the acting was below average. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were not credible at all. I also did not think Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper at home. Their social classes were too far apart to be considered credible. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the film, a scene showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? His son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It has nothing to do with the rest of the film and has never been mentioned. It seemed free and did not fit the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was nice but I was not convinced that the Dabney would have been as kind and generous as they were described.
