Although technically a little more refined than the previous movie in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, it's a weaker getaway in a less thrilling plot and in a main character who simply does not have Ray Milland's charisma . <br /> <br /> That said, several actors and characters continue to play their role and manage to fly the flag. John Barrymore is also present, appearing throughout the film in a variety of extravagant disguises. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's another endless night for comics as he and his cohorts try to save the poor girl he's planning to save. The clues are stupid, but again, the actors who support them often make them funny.
