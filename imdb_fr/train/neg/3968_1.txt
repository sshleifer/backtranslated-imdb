If you've ever seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley film and compare it to the returns it receives on IMDb, you know that most comments and votes are falsified. Trust me: you will get bored! The members of the production team write their own comments (sometimes they even admit it). But that is not enough: they constantly click on "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the film. That's why negative reviews are always placed behind critics. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad actor, bad lighting, bad script, bad end. Believe me now! Otherwise, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a very good businessman. Otherwise, we can not explain that he finds people who are still financing his films. (OK, they are cheap, but nonetheless.) But as a creative person, it is a complete failure.
