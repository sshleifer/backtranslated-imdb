I am terribly sorry. I know that Fa√übinder is still considered one of the greatest filmmakers in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered masterpieces. I wonder what everyone has to say about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all smiles like an idiot! -, the changes between Nazi glamor and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film seems to have been shot in two days in an attic. It was probably so and many people seem to take it for "real art", but for me this film is just bad and cheap. Compare that to Viscontis "The Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
