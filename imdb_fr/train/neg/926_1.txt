This film is about Tyrannus, a gladiator brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator to be brought from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This adds depth to the script and challenges our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus accomplishes his little list of things to do (killing people and saying repetitive phrases in Latin) by possessing the body of a young student. To do this, he uses a helmet of control of the magic spirit, which the schoolboy willingly puts on his head, then repeatedly in the film, removes and rests. <br /> <br /> Maria practices oral sex on a poor man, Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears the roller glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason, and is apparently sitting next to the CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Totally unfortunate. <br /> <br /> This film is empty and will hurt you. To see him
