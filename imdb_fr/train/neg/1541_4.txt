I hated this film intensely and I left during the scene where the loyalist gang is shot down by the British. The film actually blames the people of NI for being the cause of their own problems. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and had nothing to do with the partition of Ireland by Britain and the dominance of its history. NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, even if I despise the loyalist paramilitaries, they were fighting for a cause: to maintain their artificial privileges on the Catholic community. We know that the British secret services collaborated with loyalists during the war, probably to keep Catholics at bay and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the 90s concerning "machismo", masculinity, etc. are transposed to the 1970s Belfast and are described as part of the supposedly unique Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. The stupid song of the club woman - the old Ireland of the green fields ..blah..blah .. - has a symbolic stature, that is to say poor young fools who fight for an impossible cause. Time-consuming, ahistoric, cheap and nasty trash O'Sullivan has made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
