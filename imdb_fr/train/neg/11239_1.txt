Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people who leave positive comments about this film must receive royalties. It's a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money or sense of humor doing a slasher / comedy video. They would receive a D for that. College students would receive an F or ask to leave school. Since this "monstrosity" was created by "professionals", I feel that there should be a jail term or at least a probation in the cinema. I like to watch bad movies like "Plan 9 of Outer Space" but, this thing does not even fall into this category. The script, the acting, the sound and the staging are so difficult that it is almost unassailable. If you like watching bad movies, stay with Ed Wood, Blaxploitation or the horror movies of the 1970s. After watching this, you get the impression that you have lost an hour and a half of your life.
