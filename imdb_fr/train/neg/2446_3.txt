Rajkumar Santoshi has undoubtedly directed the greatest movies and greatest hits to Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This film lives up to all of its expectations since this film stars two great actors, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar You have these two actors in the same movie you need to make a Magnum Opus. <br /> <br /> In the later part of the film, you can say that Amitabh Bachchan's voice was dubbed by another person who was due to his illness. <br /> <br /> The film still did not have a proper character development and the cinematography was not good either. One thing Bollywood should learn is that they should only use visual effects when and where needed. Applied should be done with a high budget. The script had so many flaws that give the viewer an apology for attending his phone calls rather than watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The newcomer shakes the leg but can not act Well but where the film loses big time is the script scenario and filmography. <br /> <br /> A talented actor like Bhoomika Chawla was defeated in the film, as was Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director has once in his career made a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you're a fan of multi-Starrer Flop movies.
