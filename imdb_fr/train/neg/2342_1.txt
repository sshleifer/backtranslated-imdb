I do not know what would be so great with this movie. Even worse, why would anyone bother to see him? First of all, there is no story. One could say that even without history, a film can be worth watching, because it evokes a strong feeling (laughter, tears, fear, ...), but in my opinion, this film does not do it either . <br /> <br /> You watch pictures for +/- 2 hours. There are other useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I guess you could say that the film is an experience and that it is audacious because it lacks all the above. But is it worth 2 hours of your precious time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is: no.
