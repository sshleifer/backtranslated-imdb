This film describes the experiences of two successful men (including Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag-queens on a night in Miami. Converging scenarios ultimately bring all people together at one place and time. The film was rather entertaining, but the big problem was that everything was happening at night and that many scenes were literally underexposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was going on. In some scenes, you can actually see where they tried to stretch the development process to record the images. Someone did not know how to use a movie camera. Incredible that this movie is even out!
