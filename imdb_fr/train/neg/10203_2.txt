Well, the writing was very sloppy, the staging was more sloppy and editing aggravated the situation (at least, I hope it was editing). the acting was not bad, but it was not so good either. almost none of the characters were friendly. at least 45 minutes of this movie was a waste of time and the other about hour was not used anywhere near its potential. It was a good idea, but another good idea was lost. it could have ended 3 different places, but it continued until a rather predictable Hollywood ending. and what was not predictable was so badly done that it did not matter. the end was not worth watching. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of films. the film was in a hurry too. the film was not really worth seeing, and if I had paid that, I would have been very angry. I was perhaps more disappointed because I was expecting a very good movie and a bad one. the movie was not so bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c, I liked the idea so much and I liked a character (justin I think, the super smart). and he also had very economical means of covering the holes of the plot. it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty. Anyway, if you see it, wait for the theater or video at $ 1.50, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, so I guess you'll like this one.
