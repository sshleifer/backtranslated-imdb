A young man has a bad day, goes out on a hill and falls where he can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" type of 2000 years ago, is his best friend and a sound by Arnold Schwarzenegger. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and later adapts to modern life. So what's the problem? This is the ugly idea for a "family" outing! Anyway, this one should not have been tried at all, really! Our fictional character of power and strength is nothing more than a typical stranger who seems ordinary to the rest of the universe. To blasphemy is added the lack of novelty or attraction, and even before you know it, there are attempts of violence that do not qualify this as "family" entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains about his sub-shorts is gagged. Just spend a quiet afternoon in the park to change your mind.
