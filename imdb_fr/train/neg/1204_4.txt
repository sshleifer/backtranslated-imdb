I remember Devil Dog playing TBS almost 20 years ago. My older sister and her friends looked at her and laughed all the next day. It's not so bad for a horror movie designed for television, but it's a derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and business, for lack of a better word. You will not be surprised by a clever cinematography or an excellent interpretation, but it is not a waste of time either. This is the kind of movie you watch kill a few hours without feeling too much thinking. <br /> <br /> However, if you go into the movie in search of some laughs, you have won. Do not be disappointed. The first scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with the eyes of Children of the Damned, are hilariously non-threatening, and the effects of a giant blue screen of a giant black dog (with horns!) throw aside. And keep an eye on the masked Satanist in early Maverick tones. <br /> <br /> This is not a big horror movie, but I wish they would always do these things for television.
