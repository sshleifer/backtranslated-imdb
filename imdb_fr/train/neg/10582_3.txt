At first, I was convinced that it was a film specially made for television and not worthy of prime time. But after a few minutes of amazement, I realized that there was at least a comic value in the cascades and the movie game c. This film would have got a 1 if my wife and I had not laughed as much as we watched in amazement that the actors could keep their face impassive. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena and not Jim, after all the cuddles and high-fives. Some rums and cokes will certainly help it to go down more easily.
