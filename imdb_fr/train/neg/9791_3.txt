Basically, this is a couple who wants to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency, they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt it. If you think it's stupid, hold on, because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives in his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Spare me!) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché about the family problems, the jealousy of the elder "brother", and in the end, all the problems are solved and they all form a "happy family" . It's boring and exhausted, it's also shown in the most straightforward and less sophisticated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director thought he was creative by inserting a mouse into the shot, or he was just trying to fill in a few minutes, but he only made the boredom snap to abominable. <br /> <br /> Then why did I give a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some fun shows, where Stuart uses his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the movie would work pretty well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother". b. He had kept the funny concerts, like Stuart trying to thwart the cat, and had left aside boring clichés that do not even correspond to anything else.
