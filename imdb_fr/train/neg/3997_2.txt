After spotting the high rating on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond this high rating, I deliberately avoided reading the reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also appreciated the way the hotel manager tried to dissuade him from entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for scary things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin responds credibly. He is panicked. I am encouraged and think of myself, it will be good. The people who made this film understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But that's what happens next which was a big disappointment. The subtlety is quickly being replaced by the predictable approach to guns ... Simply blow the audience with every scary Hollywood trick in the book and hope something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on alone? Well, it's always scary. Objects moving in the room? Well, you can not complain about that. Blood flowed from the walls and flowed? Awesome. Ghosts who commit suicide? Well. Nothing else? What about loud noises, tremors, fire, more tremors, damage in the room, more blood, etc.? It's all good. And everything has been done before. Over-simulate our unbalanced audience with attention deficit with all kinds of things in quick succession and he will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And you know what else is there? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fear. But this movie had no scary moment. The audience was silent and disinterested. I did not feel cold in my back. Nothing. The Shining was 100 times what this movie is trying to be. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people who say it's one of the best horror movies of all time? Friends of the director? Sorry I do not understand.
