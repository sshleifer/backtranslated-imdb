This science fiction adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comic. Odd pink hues and unusual special effects make it a favorite of late, late viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight strange giant monsters resembling amoeba and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The troupe includes The Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Be comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you go to sleep for a moment. I agree to add it to the list of cult classics not to be missed.
