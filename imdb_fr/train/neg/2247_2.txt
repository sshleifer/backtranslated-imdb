Kris Kristofferson, at its peak drugged in the mid-70s, is barely able to sneak on screen alongside the gigantic ego of La Streisand and the feminism of discount stores. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really nice; I was so happy when Kristofferson's Ferrari fell on that hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film about rock and roll celebrity, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made about a year and a half after this dreck).
