We had STARZ free weekend and I turned on the station to see what was going on. It was this movie Howling II: The acting was awful but the pleasure of the eyes was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as a previously mentioned eye candy. I laugh a lot of the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends are wondering why I never want to go to horror movies. If they saw this film, they would know why. I would be kicked out to laugh so loudly. <br /> <br /> Just a few notes: Reb Brown who played Ben White had played the role of Captain American in a movie made for television, Marsha Brown was the inspiration of Mick Jaggers for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick certainly tastes good for women.
