Ok first, this movie is nil. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of turning matter into energy, storing, transporting and gathering it is intriguing, to say the least. But it's as far as they take this premise. Instead of digging into what could happen if someone made that kind of machine, they broke that damn thing. It could have been a good premise. Live with the responsibility of this kind of power and manage the constant temptation, that is to say ... the invisible man. But no .. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. Then the doctor assembles the thing and tries to move. Only to have gaffed by his beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh). Which would not have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now, he walks the country and kills people because his little experience has failed and they would not give him any money. Wah. Then, to make the movie worse, install a disastrous British relationship between the two semi-skilled professors hired to assist him. Between their love sessions, they try twice to find him while he kills half of London. All this could have been avoided by not breaking this damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried, so I gave it 2 stars to make efforts, but it would have been better if they had not broken that damn machine, forcing Lembach to leave, making him try again. Damn Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
