This is the perfect example of something big that goes terribly wrong ... That's why I can advise someone to look at it? well, I was a bit forced by the fact that it was in the tiff contest (I still can not believe he won) .. and I only stayed until the end because the director was there for a question and answer section .. but it was also interesting ... what is it? Well, the first half (the one that is worth watching) has three characters: a whore, a musician and some kind of official..the first two lie about their professions..but the third is true liar .. the second half (do something else .. do not ruin a good evening) includes some old boobs and heavy drinking .. but maybe you'll see it completely different ... the tiff l did they (did they drink vodka?)
