Unfortunately, this film does not give credit to the original. Nicholas Cage, quite wooden with respect to actors, permeates the screen with a range of skills ranging from non-sursed to on top. Secondary distribution is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains much the same as the original in terms of progression of the scene but is much worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to know what is being sold. It turns out that it's just a bill of poor property. Unbelief can not be suspended, nor can doubt be granted. The only salvating aspect of this film is that it is very visual, as the media demands, and congratulations to everyone who watches the place. <br /> <br /> The audience was the subject of a lot of laughter and many the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to be broadcast on TV, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
