I had the chance to see A Chorus Line when he came to my city .. I was younger then .. but it was an excellent piece .. so someone would like to tell me why, in heaven, name did they have to make a movie with that .. and why did Michael Douglas ??? It was not suitable for the role .. this movie has really shit BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is not to rent this movie .. keep your money for something better, like "Cats" ....
