There was not one redeeming factor in this film. The girlfriend and I love action movies. Especially fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was great), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talk and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has fought and is forced to appear seriously constipated at all times. The Army disrupted his stool and improved his fighting technique. The music is not good either. They fight in the rap and hip-hop style of the street, because these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack consists of the usual background noise of low-budget drama. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is classic. The actors deliver their lines as if they were read on memory cards and the lines themselves should be burned and left in flames in a rotten Hollywood lane. The film is called "Honor", but this film had no honor. It was simply a waste of money and I consider that spending wisely is honorable. <br /> <br /> Go instead to see Felon. Scenes and combat situations are more real.
