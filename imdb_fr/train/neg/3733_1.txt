Weak, stale, tired, clich√©; wants to be a basic instinct, but misses one opportunity after another for new perspectives, new perspectives. Tasteless, banal, grotesque and without the potentially redemptive value of brevity; oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes ... it must have seemed * much longer! I would prefer to clean the bus station toilets with my toothbrush than having to go back to it. I express an opinion here: I guess that means I did not like it.
