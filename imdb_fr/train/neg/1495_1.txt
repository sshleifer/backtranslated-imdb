I've been watching horror movies since I was 5, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good horror and bad movies, but this is without a doubt the most DUMBEST movie I've seen! The actors did everything with the material. The plot was just stupid. Besides, it was all gore. I can bear a lot of blood, but it was ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stabbed in the back and suffocated with his intestines! Simply stupid! Another problem with this film is that it is boring and probably the slowest film ever made. The end of it is just stupid. But again, it goes with the rest! In the end, when the girl moves away from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, she attacks him! She turned into a cannibal! Delayed film.
