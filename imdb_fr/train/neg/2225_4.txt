Honestly, I do not understand why this film is so noted here, or why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I'm a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially "Heavy Traffic" and "Wizards", but frankly, "Wizards" (1977) was his last good movie. After that, he turned to the general public, starting with the diabolical "Lord of the Rings", then attacking with the heavy weight of sword and witch Frank Frazetta, for "Fire and Ice" . <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is childish, the animation is TV quality - I insist that it's much worse than in the 70s - and that 'Wizards' had a real imagination, that it was weird, that it had great background backgrounds and an adult underground sensibility, Fire and Ice is just designed for 14-year-old boys, and has the intellectual weight of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. Yes, if you liked Gor's books, you may like this. In my opinion, it was just another problem in quality after "Wizards", which Bakshi never recovered (although he has recently made decent television reports). <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
