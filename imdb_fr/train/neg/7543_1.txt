A soldier is on the side of the road to make sure each 1 meets the speed limit (does his job); he then stops a woman who seems to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he then tells him what's wrong and BAM ... they're killed. Okay, that's the beginning of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I watched this movie in the cinema, I was with friends. It was our first night after the summer so we wanted to see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that would please everyone in the group ... it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I lose $ 7,000 on a movie ticket, but I had to suffer torture for the brain. This film started with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought that "it can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The problem with this film is that it makes no sense; even if you can do without the bad acting, the "not so scary" scenario and the horrible mess of this movie, you'll always be puzzled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, it's because no human with a brain could understand what this silly movie is about. Right now, you may be thinking, "Oh man, I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as that person says it." GET THIS THOUGHT OF YOUR HEAD IMMEDIATELY !!! I'm trying to spare you the trouble of watching this film and telling you it's so bad that you do not have to look at it. Please, people do not make the same mistake, but I thought this film had potential ... it's not the case. I give this film 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero I would do it), and I do not recommend anyone to see this movie, you will save yourself many sleepless nights trying to think with w.t.f. this freaking movie is about.
