I was bored, around 10 pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids behaved as if they were older than 11 years old ruined everything. One of the children had a ring that killed people after about three years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to become a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything is so serious, as if Billy (the main character) did not devour the worms, the world would end then. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for little kids (except for a 5-year-old child called "penis"), but not for teens or adults who do not want to waste their time .
