I went to see this film at our university theater thirty years ago, because I loved Bruce Dern in the silent race and the family plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on, with no discernible points and then - it just ended. The lights went on and I watched everyone look around with confusion. Had the projectionist missed a reel? I never wanted to know it. All I remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about boring college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the following words from the audience totally mystified. Fortunately, it was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
