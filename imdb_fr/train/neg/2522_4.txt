What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​robots that clash is cool, but the scenario is ridiculous, human action laughable, the non-existent act and the special effects (on which this type of film depends) are archaic. I thought it should be done around 1980-1984 and I was surprised to see that it was from 1990. It's been 5 years since Aliens! Okay, a lot of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I thought, what's the point? it looks totally incredible. It would not bother me to see a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still like the idea of ​​huge robots unraveling each other.
