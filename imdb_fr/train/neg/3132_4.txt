I did not see such a fabulous evaluation on IMDb, but I did, because I'm a big fan of Bible-related material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too Indiana Jones movie, but it also seemed that Casper Van Dien had not seen these Jones movies (but he should). I think he did his best, but the script just feels. The music tried to be a bit like Jones. Great work, but for such a movie, it seemed to be too much work, as if the video part did not deserve all this great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but the script set everything up. "The jokes" are from the old school, somewhere 20 years old; they only brought me a cynical smile. There are very bad angels vis-à-vis the camera, SFX looks like a craft and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea of ​​the story (in my opinion, but I like such stories), but things simply did not work. Maybe he should put it on a paper when he was still fresh in his head. When I (in the first few minutes) saw that this movie was going to be one of those "low budget movies", I hoped I could at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the movies are simply disappointing.
