This movie was horrible. I watched it three times, and not even at all. It's just impossible to look at, the plot of the story is nil, it's depressing and completely disgusting. I do not write anything for nothing, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his early dialogue and some fun parts of the movie. The little kid of this film is annoying and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in American theaters, so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, was I wrong !!!! The acting is horrible and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the other main character, did not play in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she was in very good movies. Same with John Savage. This film is bad!
