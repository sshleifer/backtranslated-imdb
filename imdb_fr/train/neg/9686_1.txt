Screenwriter / director Peter Greenaway cements his title of Pretension of the Supreme Lord of Art with his latest exercise of hateful indulgence, 8 ½ Women. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son in their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, inciting and singing women (guess how much) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of a possible way this premise could be offensive, and it is likely that Greenaway did it. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists. There is Mio, obsessed with Kabuki, Giaconda and Beryl, still pregnant, who has a soft spot for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, it's the "half woman", do you understand? Greenaway vehemently denies any accusation of misogyny, but if that's not it, what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticise everything related to Japan, a sequel to the themes of her humming - the 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ Women is excited and exploited. Greenaway's work is fetishistic and tasteless, and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the author himself.
