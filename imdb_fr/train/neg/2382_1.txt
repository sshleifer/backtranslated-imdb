There are movies like "Plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same inexplicable appeal as a car accident, and there are some others like "Desperate living" that you hate to admit that you like. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The actors together have enough talent to make almost any scenario, and from what I've been told, the book is nice. <br /> <br /> How could this movie be so intolerably bad? For starters, it seems that the director has assembled a list of names with no other link than that of 20 people. Then tell them to do their best to imitate Kevin Costner. Open the book randomly and start filming everything on the page, ensuring that the vast expanses of America are of no interest. Finally, entrust the assembly work to your brother-in-law, because the meat packaging factory has just dismissed him. He has twenty years of experience in cutting. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad that it's not even good to be bad.
