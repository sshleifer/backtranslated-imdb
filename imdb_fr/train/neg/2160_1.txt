Gods ... where to start. I could digest only the first 10 minutes before turning it off with disgust. Aside from the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest was just terrible. And, I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief until now. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the first episode, I lost count of the number of mistakes, intrigues and horrible costumes that were there. It started with a poor farmer who was looking for a deer to feed his family. Everything is fine. However, the poor fighter had to be largely deaf, because a handful of soldiers in full armor, on horseback, managed to sneak about thirty meters. <br /> <br /> Then, as he ran away, he goes from having them 10 feet behind him to a shot where you can not even see them at all, immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him . Then he runs into bushes and is immediately mistreated by two of the soldiers who, a few seconds before, were galloping on horseback, tens of meters behind him. <br /> <br /> The armor on "the soldiers are so obviously clothes that they tried to make them look like stitch and failed miserably." Not to mention that the "armor" of the main soldier was to about 5 sizes too big for the poor guy Seriously, he looks like a little kid wearing his father's oversized armor! Finally, Robin manages to shoot about 5 perfectly directed shots all around the hand of a soldier, in the space of about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a recurve bow.No living human being could do that kind of shooting, in such a short time, with a sniper rifle, and let alone a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they escape the soldiers and stop to help an incredibly dressed and clean "peasant" man with a ditch ... something that all the nobles were willing to do all the time, no? How did this excuse for a series ever have a second This season is beyond me, the production costs (at least for what I've seen) have had to climb in tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think that high school theater class could have offered a better interpretation. It was so bad, even that terrible version of Robin Hood by Kevin Costner was better. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest you avoid this monstrosity and go to rent or buy the series "Robin of Sherwood" dating from the mid-80s. Much better written, played, costumed and produced. <br /> <br /> For shame, BBC ... for shame ...
