The revelators of this criticism are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and shoot down at the end. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself but was afraid to hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, entitled "The life and death of the wicked Skelton" (I guess people did not have it about spoilers at the time), was written by a woman, a child of the troubled or cynical English navy, or both. Her heroine is incredibly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But there are other things that matter, like the fact that Lady Barbara reacts immediately and only when someone gets in their way, it's a homicide. She murders three men in five attempts. Serious femme fatale series, she has a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have taken her to Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her like a narcissistic vampire, so much made up that I considered her a Joan Rivers from the time of the restoration (or a Joan Rivers from the time of the restoration, ah!). Still, Lady B. is irresistible to the three main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all doing good work, just like Patricia Roc. Of course, the three admirers realize very quickly what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them ends up shooting her - accidentally, in this which is supposed to be irony or a simple dessert. Given the dramatic death scene with a boom raising the camera through the windows and toward the sky, I guess we're crazy about his death. But his is the first corpse we do not care about.
