This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in the following O'Leary films, he was performed by actors much younger than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of parents (all played by actors of known characters) gather in an old house (a rainy night), of course!) to talk to a rich parent who falls into a coma. <br /> <br /> While they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious acts occur, including two murders. <br /> A scary movie; worth to be seen!
