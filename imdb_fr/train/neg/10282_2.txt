I did not expect it to be a good movie, but I did not expect it to be so horrible. I hated the character of the mother so much that I had to turn the channel. I returned it, hoping it was only part of the movie, but no. And for the girl to sit there, you must be embarrassed, or have almost finished her work or be pushed to madness at home? I hope you are joking? I was brought up with my mother's respect (and even fear), but I would quickly get her to the nearest hotel if she proved it was boring at MA's. After all, I had to follow a set of rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I did not buy anything. I tried to give him several opportunities, I really did. Sorry.
