The Hazing is a confused mumbo jumbo who wants to be The Evil Dead so much that he even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that it's just not in the same league as this fantastic movie. This film is far from being so original. The plot has already been used by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and it was a lot more fun. This film loses too much time with a complicated exposure before bringing the children into the spooky mansion and start the demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif has, as usual, not much to do here, but when he's screen he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the children's game, it is passable but not good. The bumpy work of the camera is more annoying than clever or atmospheric. There are some good times when the first man is possessed and throws a deadly ship around him when sending his victims, but it has never been scary for a second. The level of gore is medium to low, but the director tries to catch up by showing actresses topless several times. All in all, okay if you have 87 minutes to spare.
