This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected, after seeing the first two, but I continue to be drawn into these types of movies with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it right this time". No, not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what's going on for SFX in this film, a soldier is shooting at a "Raptor" that is going down a hallway. Even with less than a second of time on the screen, the viewer can easily notice that it is a man with a tail apparently stuck to him running around. Bad Bad Bad Bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If that's how you can call it. I guess one of the characters is supposed to be from the south. However, having lived in the south for six years now, I have never heard of it that way. Maybe there is some kind of strange handicap - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does not do anything that forces him to have that accent - so there was no reason for the actor to try to make one. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptors escape, armed people have to chase them. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to come up against the nearest tunnel system ... would not they stay outside to hunt their prey? Oh well, at least they have the good sense to figure very very little in the film that supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there's a man eating raptors running around. Would you decide to take the time to argue over who's the best - Army or Navy? And then decide to hold a wrestling contest to settle it? How about the idiotic idea that they have to find raptors? Separate yourself in groups of two. Have they ever seen horror movies (or at least one episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, it's one of the stupidest movies ever. Do not miss it unless you want to moan through a movie.
