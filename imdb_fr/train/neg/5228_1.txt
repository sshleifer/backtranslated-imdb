I saw this movie the other night. I can not even begin to express how bad the film was. Writing, dubbing, even claymation. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span in the name of comedy. It does not work. It literally falls flat about every possible place. <br /> <br /> In addition, the animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know it's a movie made by one person but I think he could do 97 minutes of shit, maybe he could do at least 1 second of funny. cake to be the worst movie of all time. Yuck. It was so bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: do not even buy it or look for it elsewhere. Your brain will do it for you.
