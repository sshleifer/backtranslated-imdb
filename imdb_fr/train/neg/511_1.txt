I was one of the many extras of this big bomb. I was in the right place to work safely on the racing scenes at A.I.R. thank you god my scene in the very first minutes of the film and I do not have to sit through it all. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but hey, the pay was good. The attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who would know it. The funny thing was to see the cars on track at very slow speed and then in the movie sped up at speed which was almost at normal speed. Many of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I guess to reduce costs and time. But everyone had such a good time who cared!
