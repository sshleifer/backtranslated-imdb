For years (as it was reported), the television meeting of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started badly - and then went downhill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), meet in New York after a long separation and get closer to each other. What an innovative concept! But, sad to tell, none of them was worth mentioning (let alone making a movie) during those years. Instead, the script is content to throw away the old devices of the story (most of which relate to older women in the workplace), while completely missing the unusual charm and sophistication that made the original the show. The support cast is instantly forgotten, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once had together left. Moore would have blocked this project for years, waiting for "just the right script" before committing. If it was the one she considered "right", what was the one she refused? It is not the age of the characters that makes it (as time inevitably advances), but the almost total lack of imagination, associated with a flagrant disregard for the elements that made the series work. At one time it was a pilot project, but it is obvious that this did not attract any interest from potential sponsors. Or by the way, among the potential audiences. Forgotten quickly and luckily, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic.
