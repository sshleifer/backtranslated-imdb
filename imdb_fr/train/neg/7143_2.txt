This movie contains some of the most awesome cars I've ever seen in a movie, and certainly the hottest women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read it with a small inflection, you also have the acting game. <br /> <br /> Start, bring in the characters, sing with an exciting woman (obvious lip synchronization). A music agent or producer enters, thinks she's great and asks her to run. She refuses, too many bad memories. Flash to war hero, back from the war, has several fights and becomes a movie hero with the attitude that he is better than everyone else. Go on a fast exotic car. Brother races, then dies. Heroes avenge death, cut to get weapons from a friend. (You've never seen this friend before or after, but you seem to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I mean, are you really sure? Yes, give me weapons are you really sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can not get you out, be careful dude, I love you. <br /> <br /> He will now blow up the house of his uncle who owned the car that his brother was driving. Find a woman, decide to save her, she goes away and he does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the film. Oh yes, we have to add one more scene with nasty people who come to hit people who do not count, but maybe that adds a little plot. The race is not even exciting, of course, it ends with two cars in the race, and one that should win a surprise victory. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send me all your money because I should have given you the same pleasure as this movie. Do not get me wrong, the cars are great and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
