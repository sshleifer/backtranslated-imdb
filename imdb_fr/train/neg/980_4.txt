My first complete Heston movie. The movie that everyone already knows the end. A "Sci Fi Thriller". The campy factor. All that goes with this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and the morning I watched it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in (not want to move in blankets). And although I tried to understand what was happening to achieve an end that will forever be ruined by pop culture, it just did not succeed. Everything was everywhere, relationships had no spine, the end had no advance. Everything was there, somehow, in a weird way and the observer has no choice but to leave the end to which he is coming, partially dumbfounded. Although we all know it's the people, it's hard to know WHY these are people who are seriously trying to enjoy the film for something other than the stupidity thrown to the window.
