Listen, I'm sorry if half the world is offended by this, but life is confusing enough. I do not need to look at it like that. I appreciate Anthony Hopkins, great weather. I even looked at Fracture and I knew it would be a smoking heap of Quentin. But this thing is not well done, and it's not daring - even if it's artistic. Well produced films have reasons for cuts and quick editing, not the excuse "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation". This thing is going to hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture of all time. I still love AH, and I will always give it another chance, but if you do not have the time to look at bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
