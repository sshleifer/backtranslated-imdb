A boring film about a boring city of the 50s. How can one think that it is a classic? The producer almost ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, in several films far above her acting capacity. I think this film shows how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future films would be. Cybil Shepard's career plunged after several films that Peter Bogdonovich produced. It was only at "Moonlighting" that his career began to return. I thought the acting game was a misinterpretation of the "Graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the United States. The only place I looked at it was overseas in Europe late at night.
