The plot of this film is based on an important point: this murderer was also a responsible father, loving and caring. It's not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is accused of murdering a teenager without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think a father who cared less about his own daughter could have been cool with someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, he could have been cold-blooded and yet worried about his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would ask the parents of his victim to take care of his daughter is inconceivable. <br /> <br /> That being said, the characters acted with conviction. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bakula's eyes made him look colder and more threatening than he usually is. You could not see in his eyes at all.
