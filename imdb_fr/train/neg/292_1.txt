I saw it appear by chance on the cable and I wanted to like it, because I thought Sandra was pretty funny from what I remembered. The only movement of the face I had throughout the film was my jaw stunned at the horrible film I had just suffered. <br /> <br /> The person who said it was one of the funniest movies of all time, please indicate a line, just a scene that deserves a little laugh. <br /> <br /> She's a better singer than I remember, but I did not want to watch a show number. <br /> <I think it's a difficult film to love because they think they should do it and do not see it in an objective way.
