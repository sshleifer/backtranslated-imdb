I've seen bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy who beat me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible, so boring that I came half way and could not stand watching the rest. Pity. With talent such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer who has an overnight affair with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged his cat, etc., etc., so that Branagh sent him to a dungeon, and he escapes quickly. In a way (I could not understand how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed up in this story that moves more slowly than stationary. I wanted to love that and, being a big fan of Grisham, I read everything about this movie and I was (stupidly) expecting something interesting. Honestly, this is the worst movie I've seen so far and I wish I could get my money back. * out of *****.
