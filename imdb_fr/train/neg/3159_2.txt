Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion on this movie but today was the first day I watched some of the other reviews. There are many people who agree with me, but the scary thing is that there are people who really seem to like this movie. I do not like writing bad reviews or criticizing others' opinions, but I think it's fair to warn anyone who might be debating whether or not to see this film. It's not a good movie. I really like movies and I'm going to watch just about anything, but this film was included in the extremely short list of films I watched and that I had the pleasure of leaving midway . If you're really tempted, watch the trailer ... that's the mistake I made because the whole film is essentially in the trailer ... after that, there are no surprises , just a shocking dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I would not like to criticize him, but I think it's my job to stop other people from losing hours of their life in a movie like this! !
