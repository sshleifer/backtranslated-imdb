The second rebirth, first part, shows how the first machines rebelled against humans. It all starts with a single case, in which machines claim to have the right to live too, while humans consider a robot to be something they own and can do with what they want. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting premise, the story becomes really ridiculous with (violent!) riots between robots and humanity. In a way, it does not seem right, as another reviewer points out, it's a bit too smart. <br /> <br /> Animator stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (especially Osiris) work for the better. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I would say that it is too violent and too stupid. 4/10.
