I wanted to like this movie, yes it's a SAW movie, blah blah blah ripoff but I like these movies. If it was done well, all the ingredients were good, not brilliant, but good movies .... unfortunately, these ingredients were gone! The acting was terrible, and it was first seen when the captives are presented with their captor one by one (hoods removed). that it was bad writing coupled with a bad action game. Two of the captives had a relationship and did not recognize it until further in the film ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I'm even wondering why I'm bothering to examine this. movie at all. <br /> <br /> I will end with plot holes, plot holes and more plot holes! DISAPPOINTING!
