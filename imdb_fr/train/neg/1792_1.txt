Let me start this review by saying this: I like vampire movies. They can suck (har har pun), and I will always love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing, considered by many to be a mass of smoking shit, was nice to me because there were vampires. You can ask, "What does this have to do with this movie?" The answer is that I intend to inform you how horrible this film is, that even a vampire movie (harharhar) aspirer like me can despise such a movie. <br /> <br /> The stars of the movie Van Helsing, a university professor who is not at all convincing. He is a terrible actor, like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote it to add salt to the wound. Honestly, I did not want to offend him, and I'm sure everyone had fun making this movie, but watching it was really painful. I do not know why I watched all this; It may have been a morbid fascination, like watching an impending train accident: it's horrible, but you can not force yourself to look away. His main fault is that it's so boring and his plot is so ridiculous, even for a sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> But I'm moving away from the subject. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course, he does not know that she was at the time; he just thinks he's one of his students (which is still illegal and everything, but not so disgusting and terrifying). <br /> <br /> If I were Van Helsing, I would shoot at least one Oedipus myself when I knew it. I had done something so rude. It would have been a funny thing if he just commented, but no. The question is not even addressed at all by any of the characters. It's as if the writer did not even think about it. I would have at least had another character make fun of him and say "Ha ha, you slept with your mother", which would be slightly humorous (although obviously immature). I probably miss space, so some extra words to dissuade you from ever seeing this movie: there is a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far, far away if you care about your time. <br /> <br /> I will say something positive about the film: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty smooth with his knife. There's like a one-minute segment where he's swinging around his knife and doing pretty clever stuff. It would be boring in any other movie, but here, unfortunately, it was the climax.
