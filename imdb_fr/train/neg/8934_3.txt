I bought this DVD without any prior reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover. I found the Brazilian title very weird, but I decided to watch a funny comedy, like "Switch". However, the senseless story is terrible and hard to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is undergoing surgery to change sex in Copenhagen. He returns to Hollywood announcing that she must be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half of the property of her uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Over the days, Myra and her alter-ego, Myron, have corrupted a young couple from her uncle's academy with naughty sex. At one point, the messy scenario is so confusing that I think the whole story is just a mental trip from Myron caused by the accident. Unfortunately, the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to contain this film. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem and Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman to a point")
