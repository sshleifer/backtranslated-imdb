This film deserves more than a 1. But I give him one because many chicken fans gave a 10, which earned him a rating that will place him in the list of 100 best. Seriously, it's not so great that it's not so bad. It's a stupid cult classic with so many admirers, it's ridiculous. These are the guys who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and always say, "I'm Rick James B! Tch", no matter how old or boring they are. I'm afraid I hear "I'm tired of MFn snakes in this MFn plane" from months ago of idiots trying to be funny. It's bad to love a bad movie, but you have to admit it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the Navy with John Cena if you want to see a real movie.
