I can understand why some people want to emphasize the link of this film with the 80s but I would not say it's a faithful description of most people's lives at that time, even in the poorer areas of Bradford . However, it is typical of the agitating waste of the agitprop that the former expensive Royal Theater Theater was brewing at that time. A lot of "cutting-edge" art for small, small audiences, but enough well-connected backslapping to ensure future orders for turgescent game fees. The fact is, if you want to think about a more real experience, you will find millions more who agree that they agree to love and live as described in "Gregory's Daughter". <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call it a "kitchen sink" drama, but it would do a disservice to the plumbing industry. However, with regard to a decent scenario, this movie is indeed all washed away. For some reason, this has had some success among Guardian readers who read moviegoers - I can only assume they get a visual thrill by pretending to tarnish it. Spread my friends. It is a mediocre film with a mediocre scenario that likes to think that it breaks the borders by adding a humorous light to the sinister life of the domains. it's not..but it's sinister. Do the dishes instead.
