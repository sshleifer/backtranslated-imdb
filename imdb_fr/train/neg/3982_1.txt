For God's sake please do not see this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this movie and its nasty villain predictable is simply lame. The characters are not developed and most of the film is complemented by Rome shots, which is much more interesting than the movie itself. To top it off, the acting is a shame. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I can not believe anyone really paid millions of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, instead go see your grandmother or something useful.
