NOMAD certainly has some of the best riding scenes, sword games and sumptuous cinematography you'll probably see, but that's not what makes a film so good. It helps, but the story must shine above these things. And that's where Nomad walks. <br /> <br /> The story is overheated, giving the impression that it has been reunited simply to create a "cool" movie that "looks" awesome. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not native to the region in which this story unfolds (and this is blatantly with names like Lee and Hernandez). If the filmmakers want to immerse us in a culture like Jugars and Kazaks, they may be even better at using actors to watch the game. <br /> <br /> Tribes at war, a prophecy, a fraternal love and respect, a The love interests that separate our "heroes" are all approached but with so little impact and time on the screen that most viewers will dismiss them in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that important changes were made to Nomad during his shooting, especially the director and the filmmaker. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (director of photography) by Dan Laustsen. In a sense, Laustsen seems to have the best eye since his land visions made the final cut we see here. It's really a good thing. However, the move to Bodrov as a director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on battles and not on people, which I think comes from Bodrov's eyes and not from Passer. A real parody. <br /> <br /> The most shameful thing is that this movie could have been really fantastic, with a focus on character and action. Unfortunately, the most senior people apparently decided that this was what they needed and chose an economical solution (intellectually). <br /> <br /> Even though I can not give a positive note to this film, it's worth watching it for the incredible cinematic work. But that's all.
