I must say that during my childhood, I am quite proud of many movies I rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the scammers movie of all time in the resume of an actor. Could you just imagine what the dismissed agent of Whoopie had to tell him to sign for this piece of shit "Hey Whoop, you've already seen this show Dinosaurs, yeah, well they make a movie, and you'll see 'Germany!' After that, this agent often had to refer to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad that I thought that Whoopie had bought all the copies of this film and destroyed them. I just hope she could have done the same thing in my memory, because my sister still gives me bullshit for watching this movie. I mean, I'll admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons I gave up on Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but this one stays in my mind as the worst of my feelings. childhood, and the biggest hiring regret of my life was 16 years ago. I am now 24 years old if you want to do the math. <br /> <br /> Every time I think of my list of all time with the worst movies, I do not even mention this one, because as a step-son violated, I do my best to repress that it never happened. See Whoopie, be happy that people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your luckiest worst.
