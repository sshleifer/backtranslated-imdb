Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular simply exceeds the spirit. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a pile of steaming shit. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud and exaggerated voices that sound like nails on a blackboard. The dubbing could have been better. Then there is the animation. MY GOD, it hurts me to look at him. Everything is too flat, too sharp, too bright and too sweet. Then there is humor, or lack of humor. It's completely stupid! They just take those grade B jokes that are not even so funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some useless humor that makes me sick. And lastly, last and least, the music. It's just annoying. It looks like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion. I wish there is a score below 1, I really do. This show must be seriously canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you have never watched this show, then do not do it. Watch quality shows like The Simpsons or Futurama.
