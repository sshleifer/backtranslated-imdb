According to IMDb, Imprint, the master of the horror segment of Takashi Miike, was banned in the United States. So I thought of translating the Swedish magazine that I had just written for her ... <br /> <br /> It was difficult not to have expectations from Ichi, the episode of Takashi Miike, the director of The Killer, in Masters of Horror. series. And the Imprint DVD cover seemed very promising. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mainly in an isolated Japanese brothel, at a time of the 19th century, and tells the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind. for which he promised to return. Tired and shot, he arrives at the brothel hoping it will be the end of his long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and silent girl, knows Komomo and that the desperate man tells him where she is and what has happened to her since she left. The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me in this episode was how little it seemed natural that the Japanese cast mostly speaks American-English. But I'm going to stop there, it's not that bad. What is a big problem, however, is how much the rest was miserable. Miike's story is moving so slowly that I could not help but look at my watch several times over the course of the 63 minutes. The long torural scene, set somewhere in the middle of the film, seemed so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that even THIS scene did not become interesting. I felt like it was violent just for the sake of the violence itself - without any sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that caused any emotion in me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling on the bottom of the fast-flowing water ... and, in all honesty, the only emotions they caused were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist looking for the love he left is played by Billy Drago, who impressed me the most like Frank Nitti - The murderer is a murderer in Brian De Palmas The Incorruptible (1987). I've always found that Dragos' portrayal of Nitti was very icy (and I hear that in a good way), and that's probably why I almost pissed off when I found it so terrible ( NOT in a good way) in this situation. a. His game seems to go from nowhere, without any empathy, to demonstrations of really bad suractors. When his character is supposed to react to the terrible things that Komomo has suffered, I was sitting on the couch, turning around to try to escape Drago's horrible jobjob. I am grateful that Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute, tells the essence of the story. <br /> <br /> The finale is probably supposed to shock, maybe even revolting and horrible, but I just found it a little ... you know ... "bof" (and I looked again my watch, for the last time, just wishing the shit episode ends). The finale may have made me smile a bit, but only because I could not help but think of an episode of Red Dwarf and the upset chins of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, eyes riveted on them to make it look like aliens ... Fortunately if you've seen this episode and you now decide to see Imprint, I'll forever messed up the visual of the end for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when the final impression is over, is that it's the only thing that has made it worthwhile to look at it that it's worthwhile to hear the theme Edward Shearmur's main (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series), and that's a big warning, do not you think? <br /> <br /> One could quote Michiko Kitamura's costume design and say that there is at least something lacking in style and sophistication ... but there are so many other films and television shows that are so much better to show Japanese "geisha fashion". It is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed. The episode Masters of Horror by Takashi Miike is boring, uninteresting and uninteresting. In other words; It's really, really BAD!
