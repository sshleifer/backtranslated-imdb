ALL FOR LOVE (titled when it was broadcast on weekends) is a romantic-era drama starring Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army, captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a girl who visits the prison. There is also a scenario involving murder. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest and admit that the movie did not appeal to me because I'm not a big fan of vintage dramas and the screenplay seems a bit episodic, but I'll say this is well done by everyone involved and the cast is good, with Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E. Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The design of the costume, as you can expect, is also excellent <br /> <br /> I would be very surprised that this film does not receive any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at tea time. Captain Saint Ives is in bed with a prostitute where the nipple is fully exposed and where there is talk of French prisoners bathing, including frontal male nudity, not to mention a murder scene where the blood is clearly visible . You really have to worry if the BBC planners have an idea of ​​what they are doing.
