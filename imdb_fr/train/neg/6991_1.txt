Just do not bother you. I thought I would see a movie with great superspense and a lot of action. <br /> <br /> But it becomes boring and terribly predictable after an interesting start. In the middle of the film, you have a little social drama and any tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end it improves but not really great. I think the director took this film too seriously. In this kind of movie, even if you do not care about the plot, you want at least a nice action. I almost dozed off in the central / main part. Note 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
