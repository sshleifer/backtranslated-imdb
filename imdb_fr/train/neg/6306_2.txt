By working in a video store, I can see a number of movies and, occasionally, I try to watch not so big movies. Proud turned out to be one of them. The original idea of ​​telling the story of an essentially black crewed ship during the Second World War had merit. However, less than 10 minutes after watching the movie, you discover that its main purpose was to talk about racial tension during the Second World War. The underlying story concerns the ship, its crew and their exploits in the war. This first point strikes you to the point of becoming excessive throughout the film. I congratulate the men who served at USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the hardships they endured. A film should have been filmed about the accomplishments of these men for themselves, for the Navy and for their country, and not for a film focused on racism during the Second World War.
