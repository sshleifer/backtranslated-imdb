It must be one of the 5 worst films ever made. The plot seemed intriguing, like that of Passenger 57. But with this last film, it worked much better. The plot was crafted in the worst possible way. Some terrible moments in the film, a flight attendant stands in front of the open door of a 747 in flight and tries to close the door without being sucked by winds of 250 km / h?!? Then the plane lands from a few miles from 8,000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 experienced pilots for thousands of hours. When she is on the track (perfectly right of course), she is instructed to shoot the shutters, HUH! Come on, the flaps are there to ensure lift at low speed, when on the track you use the thrust in the opposite direction on the engines and give maximum power! I can continue over and over again about small and especially big mistakes in the film, but my answer would then become the size of the English dictionary. It's a movie you want to miss, take me at your word!
