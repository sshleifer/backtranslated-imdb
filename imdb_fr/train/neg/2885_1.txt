I can not really say what I think about this movie, it's against the guidelines, I watched a lot of movies, and it's the worst movie to date, extremely low budget, I guess all of it Money was invested at the slaughterhouse scenes because I could have done a better job with an 8mm B & W camera and a crew of monkeys. It was so bad that I signed up just to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, the movie rental location was not enough. But that's my value of 2 centimes, I suggest borrowing it from a poor sap who rented it and observes it yourself. Because I certainly would not want to lose the money myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope your not made the rental when they will not refund your money .. =)
