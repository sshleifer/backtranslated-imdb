A rather disappointing prequel for the first two films, it does not have the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. By focusing on the guys who "manage" the cube, it removes any feeling of tension inside the cube, because we just do not care about the characters inside. Much of the film is just boring, and it only gets really bad with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the crazy green-eyed navy. After that, however, it just sinks into involuntary hilarity. The end is appropriate, however, linking it indirectly to the first. The scenario is terrible, the acting is at best mediocre and the direction unimpressive. Much less monitoring.
