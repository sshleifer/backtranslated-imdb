Dude, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm starving for a good TV and I congratulate TNT for these "opportunities". But unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I guess, with respect to the film Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing is, the irony is that it simply does not translate well on the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very little), King's experience can not be filmed with the same impact as reading stories. Many people would disagree with that, but I'm sure that in their hearts they have to admit that the best filmed story of King is only a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The story of the average king unfolds in the spirit of the characters of the story. It gives us a glimpse of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. In short, King takes the player to places where you can not install a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed king, we have less than half of the information the reader has access to. It's not so far-fetched to pretend that One becomes a character in a King story they read, while One is limited to the little voyeurism of that same character when filmed. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to film anything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of whether they should or not. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying it, but it takes an incredible amount of skill and circumspection to achieve the elusive adaptation of Stephen King that works. It amounts to transforming lead into gold or an arcane mastery of Zen. Oh well, better luck next time.
