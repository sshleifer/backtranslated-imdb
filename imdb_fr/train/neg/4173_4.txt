Man, I must say that when I saw the trailer, I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, facing evil vampires led by gender veterinarian Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I did not expect great art, but it sounded like a potential classic in the B movie. It was probably a TV pilot, reissued a bit later in a feature film, after he was not taken back. Well, I'll start with the few positives of the film, the action was competent for a low-budget film, and the CGI and the places used were acceptable. For starters, Michael Ironside played in barley and his performance here ... well, it was corny not in a good way. But as I said, there was not much involved, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA group for the Vampires, no, I'm not kidding, it's the stupidest and most incredible thing I've seen in a long time, and that's taken seriously. In addition, this movie commits one of the major sins of film B, it teases a lesbian scene and gives nothing. Especially what harms this movie is that nothing happens. As it was a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and its end is not regular. Even the main villains only come towards the end. If ever a film was to increase the factor Sleaze and Gore, it's Vampire Wars. To conclude, I will say that the main crew of the spacecraft was composed of very competent actors and could very well put this disaster behind them and move forward. They had nothing to work with here.
