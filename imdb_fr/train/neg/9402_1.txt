Why was this film made? Even bearing in mind the generous tax breaks granted to Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being allowed. For God's sake, the actors in this movie are Australian B-grade celebrities (not actors), like John Michael 'Hollywood Howson, the group's original drummer in Hey Hey Its Saturday and the voice-over comedian in Countdown. But by saying that, it's still very watchable as long as you give it the attention it deserves: none. The scenario is bad (even for a horror of grade b of itself) and the acting and film quality is worse. It often looks like it's a movie at home, but even a movie at home has "realism". Anyone interested in Australian cinema, I beg you, for the sake of God, pretend that this film was never shot.
