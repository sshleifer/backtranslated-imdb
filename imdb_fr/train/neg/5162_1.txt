This film reminded me so much of "A History of Violence", which claimed to be a thorough study of violence and violent behavior, but which was ultimately only a cheap action film posing as a film reflection on violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British wife settle in a small English town and face endless harassment from local drunkards who only stay in the pub all day and cause trouble. Do not these men have work? Anyway, Dustin takes all he can and until the end of the movie, he takes him home and fights every drunken attacker by means as horrible as boiling whiskey spilled on someone, feet torn off by a rifle, the head being caught in a bear trap. It's funny that someone needs such a big bear trap in a small British town, except perhaps putting a man's head on it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah who directed the "Wild Bouquet" which also treated blood shedding violence in which no one was spared. But it was done with style and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not credible. First, the location is bad and does not work. Why place it in England? I think maybe in a poor neighborhood or a small town in the southern United States in the 1930s or something like that. Secondly, I do not really see why these men are so fast to violence, except maybe they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah missed the target that one.
