"Die Sieger" has been highly recommended to be one of the few quality action films made in Germany. I watched it last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If this is supposed to be the "last hope" of an entertaining and challenging German action film, well, there is not much left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" is sexy, brave and furious is nothing like this. The characters are wooden and stereotyped and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen too often), they act against their nature. This makes it difficult for me, almost impossible, to follow them or even to identify with them. <br /> <br /> I especially think that the film is very badly shot. There is not a character in whom I believe. Maybe the senior officer of the SWAT unit - but that's about it. Those people who try to look like special units, or act like special units, like elite cops - I do not believe them. Not a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad after all. But I think it's badly said. You do not know the bad guy at all - for example. And when, after a "very dark" evening, Karl Simon (the good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... what for?" I asked myself the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I think Germany can do better, even with action movies.
