For starters, I must point out that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things are happening, but you do not know why or why. When you finally understand, you realize that this is only a twisted opera, with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... The characters are rather poor and the actors (especially the youngest) n 'do not help that. a lot to make them look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a superb actress, no matter if the film is pure waste. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that beginner Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and he has filmed some pretty intense scenes ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
