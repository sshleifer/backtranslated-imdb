I arrived at NEW PORT SUTH, hoping for a replacement film about the Columbine school massacre, similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT, and the synopsis of the TV guide stating that a sociopolitical student rebelling against the system had given me this impression, but it is a very boring film. consider Maddox, a high school student from Chicago, decides to retaliate against what he sees as an authoritarian regime. The major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays it, Blake Shields, is unable to embellish the shortcomings of the script. You have a premonition that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam, or bin Laden, but he never seems to be anything but a truculent adolescent firecracker and it is impossible to believe that he can gather disciples. The subtext of overthrowing a manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unconvincing drama that is not worth going out of your way to see .
