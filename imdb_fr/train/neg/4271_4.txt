Typical thriller, has been done many times before. Contour of the simple plot; The cop Liotta is obsessed with Russell's wife and he tries to bang the good old Kurt so he can have it. It's beyond any forecast, it does not even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there is no thinking outside the box. I guess the only reason to look at it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There is really nothing to say about this film, it is not particularly serious, but there is no good point either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. Idem Liotta. Stowe has a boring voice of Cher-esque. I read the plot and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and fundamental. I watched it and it unfolded before my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion. I have no feeling for this movie, it's as if I have not even watched it. Given that, it's a pretty useless movie, is not it? Still, I will give 3/10 for some reason.
