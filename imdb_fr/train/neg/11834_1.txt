Let's just say it with simple words so that even the directors of this film have a chance to understand: it's a very stupid movie with an even more stupid scenario, a lame animation and a story as original as bedbugs. Do not bother - unless you need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They could laugh, especially if they are not taking any more medicine. There is a particular insult in such a ridiculous film: not only do filmmakers think that children are mindless fools who can be entertained with a trap that costs almost nothing, but they do not even bother to break sweat by inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. Frankly, this film ticked me royally. Shame on you to stoop so low.
