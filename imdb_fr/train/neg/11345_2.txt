I mean the word "pedestrian". Looks like the producers of the movie have forgotten to have something interesting. Faith Domergue can do better than that. She is supposed to be the goddess cobra mysterious revenge torn by the love of Marshall Thompson (an idea, huh?). Instead, she's a regular housewife from the '50s, and the simple, flat expression she carries throughout the movie makes me think they've done everything early in the morning before Faith takes it his coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so "American" that the result is laughable. This is more productive covered in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cult of the Cobra" should really be called "Cult of Contractual Obligation". Why would so many otherwise gifted people somnambulate as a slow and predictable derivative failure like this?
