First, if you're a fan of comics, well, you'll be VERY disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in comics, he suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! Chicken farmers, he gave spices and guts to the comic strip (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The impressive N.Y. Winch building becomes a mid-size common yacht at H.K. The handsome Largo becomes a unshaven tzigan / Turkish guy. Freddy, the cool pilot "Scarface", becomes a fat guy, bad, sad and average. Simon, the good friend of Largo, does not exist at all !? He gave pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but only a few snakes watching ... The whole story is confusing and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the capacity or the technology to correctly adapt the comic strip, please stick to a romance shot in Paris. Very bad movie, good thing I just rent it, do not count on me to watch more (If there is!).
