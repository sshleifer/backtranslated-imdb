I rated Basic instinct 2 high, but this film got less than 4. This film only got me a 4, but it has 7.3 of more than 600 people. I do not see why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This film is boring because it almost never leaves these pieces of this big broken house. And there is only a total of 5 people in this movie. It's been almost two hours, which is totally useless. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The film can only be reduced to a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me "Three times" by Hou Hsiao hsien, we are just as boring, the dialogues are just as boring. He also has a good rating! I had to stop watching this one after the end of the first story. <br /> <br /> This film lacks passion and enthusiasm.
