Well, when the appearance of Jason Miller (appearance even more weakened than in Exorcist IV) marks the culmination of an image, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a little country, a little rock'n'roll: mix two drunkards with money dragging their child everywhere with a dried mummy on a bog (did you think that there was one left - Dried in a peat bog?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad stain job, and a little girl who could have been an interesting character if they had developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - somehow - that they return to visit his family. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks on what I have to assume is that her mother was killed in a car bomb attack (I think ). It's never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: why do we need the grandmother? Now, the grandmother could be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something like that. Maybe you can do something with her. The best they can do is that she is used to tobacco. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They embody a real unstable character as a husband. Is he doing the casting (will he sell his wife to the devil, maybe he can wait impatiently for the trust fund he manages for her) or is he against the guy ( after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He is not a bad guy. Not a good one. But not kind. Why did not they do something with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old friend introduces himself. The husband knocks him. He returns to shoot the husband. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least this character has a motivation.) <br /> <br /> NOW - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he could only have married her for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch (do you follow that?) Who can come to life. In fact, you know she'll come back to life, the music gets bigger. A little girl lives in the house, takes tea at grandmother's house (opens the door to do it) and delivers cigarettes to grandmother. Periodically, grandma goes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife lose the child in the house, then lose their bedroom. Uncle cuts his throat in the basement. The leading woman is bleeding from the nose. The husband drinks. They both drink. Faced with all this, the terrible truth evoked in the first voice is - an omigode - an abortion when the main woman was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these hanging ingredients, no one has managed to get a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no graduation from a slight disturbance to a terrible horror, just long slow scenes that lead nowhere. No one, in fact, cares - and they had places to go with this aspect - the innocent child accused of drunkards, the grandmother who could be locked up because she is a monster, but no, his worst fault is smoking. She has beautiful hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no land. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain flowing, and the soundtrack announcing us. You need more than a few drunkards and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh. Beautiful landscape, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
