It was a horrible film. Basically, Jane March was a North Korean semi-Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to US forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid in an American military family. They all regard her as Korean even though she looks whiter (I think the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 in Southeast Asia, but not at all in Korea) and the teenager household begins to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US military are portrayed in Korea is completely crazy. Of course, the screenwriter and director were obviously white men who had never spent a day in Korea before this film and who had no intention of showing a real glimpse of life in Korea Koreans or US GIs. their pathetic fantasies of Asiaphile without any regard for the fact that it is completely unbelievable. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that it is a garbage can. In the end, the North Korean honhyol spy girl gets killed, obviously "paying for her sins". Very bad movie with a sensation made for television.
