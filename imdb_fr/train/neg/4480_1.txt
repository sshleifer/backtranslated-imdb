Let me start by saying that I had not seen this movie at first with great expectations. It was recommended to me by a mediocre friend in the movies, and "MTV" was pasted on the cover, so I was not expecting much. What I expected was a larcorer, too dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start because I had never read the book. nor watched any other version of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game was my main complaint with the movie. By God is he AWFUL. The main daughter is rather mediocre, but compared to the rest of the cast, her name is Maryl Streep. The main "hero", Heath, is simply awful. He can sing clich√© songs with the right sounds, but that's about it. His acting has broken the "sad" moments by being so bad that I burst out laughing. The Isabel girl was also very good and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who could not display any emotion. And when he tried, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor to play Edward, although it was obvious that the direction was bad because even though he did not live up to what I saw him doing. Oh, and the father was not so bad in my memory, but he was in the movie for such a short time that I can barely remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More breaks than you can imagine. Predictable story (until the end, which I barely understood). EXTREMELY unilateral characters with no real depth ... Overall, nothing interesting or attractive, nothing that we have seen has done MUCH BETTER, and nothing deserves to be looked at here. to be a tearful. It did not do that. The end is not built at all, it's like almost after the fact. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the end had really arrived. When they explained it to me, I had to have a dark look on the face of "Wait, when did they say that? Never a good sign. Editing is probably the worst I've ever seen, although I'm well aware that fade-in fades are created because they were originally designed for television, but that's not an excuse. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is just garbage. I am a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during that shit, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearful, look elsewhere.
