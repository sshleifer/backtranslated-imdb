I rented this movie for some laughs. I had never seen the SNL sketch, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it could not have been that bad, was it? The answer: it was. This movie was hardly a way to relax after a hard day's work. I was still waiting for a plot and a fun part, but there was none. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson and that's about it.
