It's not really a proper criticism because I have not seen most of the film. I stopped watching him. The film is very violent, with nasty drug traffickers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> The problem was there: I had just watched what it took to get to know several characters, all of which were not interesting. Everyone was a tedious and despicable psychopath, without engaging personalities, which gave me nothing to hope for. I was not at all curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was even a person of interest, and I'm not talking about good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with her. Look at "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, the character of Gary Oldman is completely crazy, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino may have done a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not engage me.
