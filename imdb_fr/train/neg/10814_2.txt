As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was excited when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will turn this book into a film following the story actually written by the author." False!!! If the casting director intended to launch a "Jane" that was clear, he certainly succeeded. However, he surely could have found one that could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the phantasmagorical suspense of the novel when laughter was floating in the night seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the spark of the child flirting and dancing like his mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders if the writers had actually read the book. What a desappointment
