my wife is a fanatic of this show. That being the case, I bought his seasons 1 to 3 and season 4 is on order. Personally, I think the show is a big joke, the distribution is just as bad. Alyssa Milano should have stayed true to other trashy films she made, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few. I saw better special effects in the old Republic Pictures series that I saw as a child. I can understand why the main male roles remained in the series for such a short time, although I do not know if it was their choice or not. Please. please do not renew for another season, that's enough, Bob
