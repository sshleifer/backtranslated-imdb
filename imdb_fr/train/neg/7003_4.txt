(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This suite seems to have been designed to capitalize on the extraordinary European box office success of THEY CALL ME TRINITY, but this time the photos of Joseph E. Levine and Avco -Mmbassy wanted to take advantage of it. America too. Too bad they have not gone very far since the images of Hill / Spencer had a marginal success in the United States, and this film rather boring and interresting does not help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. They later mingle with gun traffickers who come out of a gun monastery and mistakenly think they are two federal agents. All of this ends up falling flat despite some fun scenes, especially one where Trinity and Bambino are in a posh French restaurant and do not know how to behave. And the scenes with the card sharks were also slightly humorous. <br /> <br /> The opening title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a Bobby Goldsboro pop song from the early '70s, while the music spreads throughout the film. good enough. I'm not sure if I want to buy the soundtrack from the CD, but others might. <br /> <br /> The film could have taken half an hour and it would not have been that long. . It looks like a lot of landscapes are chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in this matter two-thirds of his career. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant purr in the soundtrack and a poor print that should have been sent into this big pile of garbage in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step forward compared to the previous film. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
