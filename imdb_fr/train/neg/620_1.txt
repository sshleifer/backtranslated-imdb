I saw it not so long ago and I must say that this film is terrible. I watch shit movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. The scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly lame villain who likes to scream horrible word games while he kills his victims (actually worse than the one in this sentence). He has his bad luck story that he uses to justify his murders. "Everybody picks on me, the only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer likes one of the guys who goes after me, I want to kill everybody." OK, I'm exaggerating. But the premise of this film alone is to put it at the bottom of the list of crappy movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to what I just said, the kid's mother is promiscuous, he settles in front of his mother and his mother's boyfriend tells him to leave, his child refuses, insisting on that he does not leave his own house. Boyfriend is chasing the child in a cornfield. He kills the child right in front of mom, mother yells in terror, her boyfriend is like, "Oh my God, I did not want to!" Then he tells Mom not to tell the police about it. Kid was killed under a scarecrow, however. Then, like any child murdered under a scarecrow, he returns dreadfully like a killer. His victims "have not been harassed like this before ..." (Scarecrow official slogan) <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this film was shot in eight days. That's right, 8 days. I was going to give this film a 2, because despite him, he has one or two moments of redemption. (These are messes, so I'm not going to spoil it, if you really want to see that shit.) I could have forgiven the bad acting of the actors, the horrible special effects, the awful scenario and the camera work but I simply have no respect for the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This film is not as good as I say. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you like watching bad movies, like me, watch it at your own risk. All others must stay away from this movie at all times.
