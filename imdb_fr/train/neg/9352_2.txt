You can often say that a film has not turned out as it should be by the intensive use of a narrator. This film presents this device everywhere. Richard Jobson is not content with writing directly and even financing part of this film, which is added to his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing which, combined with beautiful editing, manages to conceal which is a dull and depressing tale that he must be mistaken for true art-house. Kevin McKidd makes a good performance. Everyone is well. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints mean that all scenes are shot during the day, although most are supposed to be at night, but if you know serious alcoholics, they mostly work during the day, he adds. a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this film is a waitress who does not get older for a single day in the twenty years between her appearances - a more extreme version of McKidd's problem, which passes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
