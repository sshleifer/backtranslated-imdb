I bet that Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore have negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be ready to play. Is not it too artificial for Gene to switch to the women's team and then throw herself on her sword? And big pussy? What was it that "look at me, I'm a rat!" shit double episode? All these mafia jokes cliche - COME ON! The big names that have been voted have already received money for their charity and got a tailor made outing. Hmm ... This is not the reality but the drama staged! The other Mark Burnett series, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had little time before the birth of his child. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
