I buy or at least watch all the Seagall movies. He came out with a handful of good movies, then he fell into bad stories, he hurt camera work and he almost lost me. There are some movies, he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he is forgotten again. This movie is seriously dark (whatever level you want to name). There is a lot of slash & gash going on here without a perceptible goal unless it is a warning against the army. <br /> <br /> Seagall may have played a leading role in many of his scenes too dark to say and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the villain who killed his guardian to escape the prison and then caused considerable damage. OK since when do we place an armed guard in the waiting room with a prisoner? Anyway, this villain was at least colorful and very focused. There is a lot of gore if you like this thing king. It seemed to me that the bad guys were tearing the same hole every time. I'm just glad they did not suck the blood of their unfortunate victims. I remind you my summary. Basically, this is a horror movie disguised as an action movie.Dec 6,2006
