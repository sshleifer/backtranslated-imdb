Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was done. The plot is about someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all attempts to stop it. How did Tom Selleck's career and Donna Mills survive, it's beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was that there was no football at all! Avoid this one if possible.
