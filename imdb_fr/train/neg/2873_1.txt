This film features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has beautiful green eyes, and is in the first scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing in this film that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because that kind of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills a career. <br /> <br /> The film has absolutely nothing to recommend. It's not a good horror movie, it's not a good fake news story, it's not good enough. There is no apparent skill in his production. It's like a bad student movie. The horrible elements of history do not make you sick, it's the fact that it's so badly done that makes you sick. If I could, I would give zero stars to this movie.
