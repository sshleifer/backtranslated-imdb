If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; avoid at all costs this kinematic waste. It is an insipid waste, tasteless and petty, of resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Probably the worst film I've seen in the last 18 months; horribly bad for 86 minutes of execution. If it had been much longer, I could not have written this criticism without using blasphemy. Consider yourself warned!
