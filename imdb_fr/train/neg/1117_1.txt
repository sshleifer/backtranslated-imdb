I do not really know what this movie is about. It's like a student art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's still dark except for a few seconds a day. There are long shots of insect interruptions of all kinds for no reason. The little dialogue in the film is as absurd and absurd as the pictures. A black woman enters the apartment of the main character. One way or another, she gets pregnant during the night and is shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which emerges a naked white woman. I have never been so blown away by the gravity and uselessness of a movie. Honestly, I would like someone to look at it so that they can tell me what they are thinking. But I do not want this level of hell to anyone else.
