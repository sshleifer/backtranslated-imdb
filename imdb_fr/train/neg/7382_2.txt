Well, let me tell you that I have always been a fan of Steven Seagal and that his films are generally excellent, but that simply does not fit with the others. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like all that. The main reason I do not like it is because it's very flawed and it does not make much sense. The acting is very bad even Steven Seagal is not good, the other actors that I can see because they are only video films. It does not follow a simple scenario, everything happens at the same time, which is why it does not make much sense. There is virtually no action in this movie and to make an action movie successful, you usually need to act. The special effects are very bad and you can say they are wrong. The film is the worst film of all the Seagals, so if you want to see a movie by Steven Seagal, do not rent this one, but pretend it does not exist. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> General note: ** on ********** <br /> <br /> * on *****
