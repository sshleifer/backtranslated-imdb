I start this review with a big giant spoiler on this movie. Do not read further ... that's it, look away! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher movies, is murdered here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that were put together in the middle of the 80s. Although the heroine was killed, this is a unsanitary crap. <br /> <br /> Priests and students are saved. They are described as sociopathic fools overloaded with sexual excesses who have too many internal problems to cope with what resembles the life of a junior university campus ... and the students fly away even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is Just let in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, even if I recommend you to watch your band of head cleaner, it would be more fun . <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for high physical abuse, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
