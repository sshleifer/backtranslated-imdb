I watched the unrated version of this movie and realized in 30 minutes that I never got my time back. I persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, that the martial arts would seem realistic in the long term, that the special effects would be really special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I am a complete gore hound. I count some of the movies of the 80s among the greatest in the world of cinema. This was not done in the 80s. If this movie was released in the early 80s, we could forgive the fax to look so bad. It was not so he did not have this defense. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that I winced at writing rather than squirming under torture. I do not like the hostel, I've never done it, I thought it was overrated, excited and I did not feel anything for the protagonists, but it shines like a lighthouse of grandeur next to this trash can. The back cover of Live Feed promised a turn that you would never see coming, I'm still waiting for the promised turn.
