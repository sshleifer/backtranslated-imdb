I will be brief, because a film like this does not deserve a complete critique. <br /> <br /> Given the setting, this movie could have been really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the movie were really exciting, the director did a decent job with the cinematography and the suspense, although I do not think he managed to capture the true strangeness of an empty London subway. <br /> <br /> The characters were very disappointing. Our "heroine" in this movie is worthless shit, and you do not care if she dies or not. As many people have already said, I encouraged the homeless and the black guy, who managed to make me laugh one or two (whether intentional or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain, stayed in the dark during the first half of the film, but when it is revealed, I was really disappointed. I will not spoil it, but let's just say that my sister, 10, could probably beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is just another mediocre horror film that falls into the trap of the simple Hollywood formula. This movie had a lot of potential, but it really failed. <br /> <br /> Just to underline how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish and kill the main villain. Instead, they run away.
