Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things should turn in the next few days. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film presents itself as a bad recap of the drunk life of a drunkard. His mother dies. His mother-in-law is a girl. His father dies. He drinks. He's getting married. He has children. He drinks again. His wife gets angry. He disappoints his children. The woman threatens to leave. He calls a reverend late at night because he wants to kill himself. Then, once the recapitulation is done, we receive the subtle message "Left behind". <br /> <br /> "He needed a paycheck." This is the phrase that I had to repeat again and again that the credits started rolling so as not to lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen kneels down and asks for forgiveness from Christ. Once he does, he goes out and says he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that he has found God and that it is good for her. Flip scene four months and the woman is tired of going to church. Finish the film as Madsen walks past the bar and gives a monologue on his happiness with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He sends a small wave of disdain to the bar (ie Sin House) and gives a special congratulatory eulogy to Miami-Vice after school hours, as the camera freezes the images. You see why I had to repeat the sentence? "He needed a salary". <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. The production values ​​of B-Grade 80 do not help us much. The script could easily have been an episode "Touched By An Angel". It could have been eliminated in 30 minutes plus advertisements. The acting game is wooden and never credible. Even Madsen, of which I am a big fan and who is the only reason I sat in this session, made it clear that this was his first acting job and that he did not yet know his money on camera. After 45 minutes, I was getting discouraged. This thing was like a homework. I just wanted to put it away and say that well, I saw half of it. He is good enough. But no. If I passed Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit all this time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give a 1 to this thing is for two points: 1) I like Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen". To sue me. 2) Part of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic. I will paste some quotes at the end for you to enjoy too. <br /> <br /> That's about it. To conclude, this thing is a shit that should stay red with the rest of the dung. But hello! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, THE GIRL OF MY BOSS, etc.). Now I have to watch Reservoir Dogs again and watch Madsen torture a policeman to make him respect me. See you soon, children. <br /> <br /> "This stuff will make me blind, but I'll drink it anyway" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not do it Do not understand! everything looks so beautiful! "- Madsen walking outside after confessing to God <br /> <br />" I'm going to get a book in the city later and I'm going to have my hair cut too "- Madsen after converting to the table dinner because Satan lives in your hair
