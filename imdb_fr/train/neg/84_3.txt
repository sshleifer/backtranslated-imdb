When I was a child, I thought the murderer's weapon was cool, but I was a child so I was a little silly. Even as a silly kid, the film's script was stupid and a bit boring when the killer did not use his knife to kill people. What surprises me is that the film has a really strong cast. What script did they read in agreeing to feature in this film because it is certainly boring and is only a way to show a lightsaber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole movie seems to revolve around extraterrestrials and the single weapon. The plot has two children and some guy having an extraterrestrial encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return so to speak in the mix. Dead animals and others to explore and for some reason, the only guy gets the alien's weapon and uses it to use it for a very light killing. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was shot, if a killer has good death scenes, if you're going to have alien encounters showing more than a weird thing with a vortex of light, and if you're going have the lightsabers then call you star wars.
