With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders is a constant disappointment since he hits hard with "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> "The land of plenty" is no exception. Given the fact that I was planning a moderately mediocre film even before I came in, Wenders' ambitions always seem to be getting the better of him. It is taken for granted now that his films are heavy and huge. <br /> <br /> I did not know if I was watching a comedy that makes fun of Central America or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is quite predictable. Wender's insistence on superimposing many scenes with a rock song is also extremely annoying. He covered the holes of his scenario and his realization by decorating the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that many people will find this film important and resonant, but honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort speaks only of mediocre direction. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Wenders said that by doing "Paris Texas" he was greatly helped by Sam Sheppard for the screenplay. Yes, it was the best of Wenders and he should understand now that he needs a good screenwriter. His films from the last 15 years and more were a total disaster.
