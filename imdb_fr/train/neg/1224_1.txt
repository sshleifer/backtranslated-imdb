Who in their mind is doing something as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> Accidental Assassination of a Security Guard ... characters so two-dimensional that a two-year-old could have painted them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red death toolbox? Please ... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic thugs ... <br /> <br /> Take care of hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, this film between teen comedy and thriller, voyeurism and ... woman ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Incredible and it's an insult to anyone thinking. Do not look, get away, it's more horrible than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And above all, it's trying to be fashionable by being too graphic in its violence ... <br /> <Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, it's pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
