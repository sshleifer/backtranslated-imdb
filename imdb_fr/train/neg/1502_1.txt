Django's ballad is the brothel of a movie! This spaghetti western is just a collection of movie scenes (and much better!) Supposedly linked by "Django" telling how he has brought different outlaws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) does not add anything to Django's role. Ignore this one unless you have to have all of Django's movies shot and even that might not be a good excuse to see this one!
