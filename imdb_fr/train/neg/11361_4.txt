It's pretty surreal what these flies can do ... well ... it's a cartoon, so anything can happen. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I have to tell you that I like animation movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This drawing is nothing more than a list of defects: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the slogan. This suggests that this movie has excellent 3D effects. Well, I have not seen any, at least not something special that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" of this film do not look like real flies. At least they could have made them black. But cyan is flying, seriously? With giant heads and thin torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I guess it was written for children 6 years old. I could say it in two very simplified sentences. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "These are American files after all!" Oh, leave me alone.
