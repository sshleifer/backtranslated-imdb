It was so bad that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. It was so weak that I could not even pay enough attention to tell you how much I had done it. Although I really wanted to believe that Carlito's performance would be a bit different, I just could not buy it. I do not really blame the actors, because I think it's the scenario that fell flat. I found myself laughing a few times, but I do not think these lines were meant to be fun. <br /> <br /> Its only benefit is that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I did for the original alone. This is one of those cases where they should have let the classic stay alone.
