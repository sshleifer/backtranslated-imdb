This film, originally released at Christmas 1940, has long been considered lost. A very bad copy has resurfaced and has been turned into a CD, now on sale. Do not buy it! The movie is incredibly terrible. The cast is mediocre, the scenario is awful and the staging is awful. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
