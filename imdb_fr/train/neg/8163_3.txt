I agree with everything people have said about this one, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I have ever heard in my life! There are real songs when you are supposed to listen to the actors talking! And the song is like a broadband version of Danzig singing: "The darkness of the forest! Oh the darkness of the dark forest!" or something else so little threatening. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a triple mic on a section of synthesized strings and fake drum beats. It's horrible!! <br /> <br /> Yes, male roles are awful. So are women. It's a bad case of sexist stereotypes - it's so bad! All they say is centered on being a man or a woman, reproducing the stereotypes as much as possible. Makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children were so echoed that you could not understand them. And why do female ghost children always have pretty little knots in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear well-cut pants with pretty, shiny blonde hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was too clean and spotless to be that of a man living in a cave. Beautiful beard and bangs, pa. Did you cut them perfectly with a knife or did you go to town and the living room? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
