Sometimes a place to start is a good thing, but because of the need to go too far to meet the demands of an audience with attention deficit disorder, it leads to an incongruous disorder. And for three respected actors who did a better job before and after, it's a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So let's see. Premise: A loving couple living in a beautiful house is threatened by a bad policeman. Interesting to say the least. Make the invading cop a little disturbing, why not? It was well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and it's a proven ticket for a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> This is where the dilemma lies. Create a troubling story that really bothered to put a real threat in his main characters without ever seeming ridiculous, or throwing a semblance of reality, amplifying the shock factor and making this cop so extreme - an ultra-bad variation of all the other super-bad guys who have hit cinemas since the silent age. <br /> <br /> It's the producers and directors who chose the latter. The resulting film is therefore of poor quality, with actors trying to make heads or tails in roles they have already tried, without more.
