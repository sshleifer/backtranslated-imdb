The series has had big episodes, it's not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow "The man who was death.", "The whole house" and "Dig this cat, he's really gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who has just been married to Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes, you discover that Charles married Peggy only for his money. The two go on honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road. They must then seek refuge in an old abandoned house. Charles soon discovers a secret of Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes of the first season.
