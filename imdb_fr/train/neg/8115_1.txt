This film was the most horrible viewing experience I've ever seen, and what's worse is that I had to watch it and did not have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! True, the scenario was ok ... but I found the acting awful! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her, I doubt that I could have endured watching the movie. Whenever I hear someone say "daarling" I squeak! I almost attacked a client the other day because they said "this". It made me think of one of the worst hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if it offended anyone, I'm just expressing my opinion)
