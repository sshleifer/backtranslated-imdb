Even with a cast that boasts generally reliable names such as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give an impression of depth to this film. He barely touches on the incidents that occurred that night in July 1981. Kilmer follows the same procedure while John Holmes, Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both play with hope in the other two main roles; as a woman and girlfriend of Holmes, respectively. The rest of the cast has so many small roles that it's impossible to get a dimension. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G., MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a Paris Hilton cameo.
