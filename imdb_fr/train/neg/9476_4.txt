A crazy enough whodunit featuring an all-black cast who is trying to figure out who murdered the trumpet player Philandering who was about to go to Hollywood for Make It Big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His future-girlfriend? His father? His butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result is just a little disappointing, and the actors here do not really get me in the mood to worry one way or another about the discovery. Why the snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? We do not care? The music is good, but there are few, and most are pretty "let's finish", it's not worthy of your time. There are better films exclusively black.
