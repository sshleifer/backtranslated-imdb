You can never have seen any movie and always know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How did that happen?" Because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, they will do it. <br /> <br /> No The question is "Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow this to be done?" I think he needed the money to defend himself against a nuisance lawsuit and it was determined that it cost him nothing. He knew the aftermath was going to be so bad that, out of pride, he would not even count his royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way for this sequel to not be embarrassed is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin reborn to the nation's favorite black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's quite obvious that you worked on this film with sadness, and the only way to feel better about your involvement is to be the only cheerleader of the sequel as a comment of an IMDb user. I was praying for you to rock satire, but alas, you were really making an effort to make things happen. Why not 10 stars?
