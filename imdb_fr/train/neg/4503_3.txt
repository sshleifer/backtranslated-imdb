I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha proves to be another failure of the combination of Western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after focusing on exotic scenes, some people might get tired of it. The excessive cherry blossom was, frankly, exaggerated. This is probably the difference in cultural perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the showy type, because a beautiful geisha would not be the overly Westernized pumpkin of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I am convinced that the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any type of role when he / she can look like it. Gong Li is awesome, but the power of the emotions she showed in this movie has not been translated into a Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, did not even look like a Japanese girl. Some comments mentioned the feminine particularities of Japan, delicate and particular, with which I totally agree. These are so delicate that I suppose that all modern Japanese actresses are not eligible for the role in Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and Malaysian actresses who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know much about Japanese culture. <br /> Geisha is a good move to arouse the curiosity of the American public. But if the film wins the Oscar for best costume, best director or best image, it would be an insult to the film itself and to art.
