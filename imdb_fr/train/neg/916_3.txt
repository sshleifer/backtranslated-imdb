Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide good chemistry here in this 1945 film. <br /> <br /> There is a good story about the Axis trying to get coal for the next war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not underlined. Instead, we are dealing with a so-called Boyer Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real congratulations to the action go to the Oscar winner, Katina Paxinou. As was the case for her memorable Pilar in the film "For whom rings the knell", winner of an Oscar in 1943, Paxinou plays again a Spanish revolutionary, but this time, it is a double counter-spy crossing for the Franco group. It's a pretty vicious character here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old by the window. She thought Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
