The creatures of the title are wreaking havoc in a small, peaceful desert town. This is basically the plot of this film, and although the scenes devoted to the Munchies are rather amusing (in an unconvincing way), all the rest is just filling, and bad filling. From the "hero", who is a painful contender to Woody Allen, to the town's ultra-mute policeman, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film. At times, almost all of them would appear on the screen together and say, "OK, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons?" The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it from the early 90's. (* 1/2)
