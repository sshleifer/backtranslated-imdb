The game in the movie is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting, everything slows to a minimum. I'm happy to see Sam Rockwell here, he did a great job, as well as the other actors as I mentioned, but hey ... it's one of the worst dragged movies I've ever seen. Now, maybe in a short film, this movie would be nice, but other than that, avoid it. This movie has so much load that it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never go out movies, but looking at this one at home with my family, I went out. Yes, it was also boring. Apparently, my comment does not have enough lines to post, so here is a little more filling. I guess the film I just watched inspired me.
