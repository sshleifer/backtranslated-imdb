I think the series had a great concept with which to work. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and playing is bad. Many problems could have been better described, such as the protest against same-sex marriage or the discovery of the cemetery. The series can not be called comic because it lacks a lot of humor. I should say that this show has barely been able to bring the life of the Muslim community to some extent. <br /> <br /> Until now, the second season is worse than the first. I had high hopes for this show, but I was a little disappointed. I appreciate CBC for presenting this concept to viewers. Anyway, I wish the best of luck for the future.
