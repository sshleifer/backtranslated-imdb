Yeah, stupidity! I just finish looking and I always have a bad taste in the mouth. Too many colors, too many "additions" to a story, too many stupid characters (I guess they wanted to get a comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Shame to spoil one of the divine stories of the "Arabian Nights" like this one. Childish, naive (both on the wrong track) and with many magical mistakes, I do not think it can keep a five year old child more than ten minutes. Princess is adorable, but should not sing because the actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Too bad the "good guy" is not better. In the dark, the only light is of course David Carradine, who is unfortunately below, but at least keeps his skills as an actor / fighter at the top. I'm always sorry to see him in such a situation, but I'm glad to have something to look at in charade, so thank you David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give these two stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but it would raise the final score to the entire film. The rest is so painful that I might like to note it, but there is no lover of notes at that time, and I think it would be too much.
