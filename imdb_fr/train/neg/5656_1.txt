Ziab ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. It is only a superposition of scenes without obvious link. Acting is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But something is really amazing in this film, talk about sexuality, emancipation of women, nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema, even nowadays. I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote this film as terrible are not only the scenario and the acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This film looks like an amateur movie. We can see a lot of mistakes on the screen. If you want a good Arab movie, Ziab ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies all over the Arab world, watch them and make your friends and family do the same.
