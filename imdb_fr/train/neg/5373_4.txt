This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack considerably stronger than the dialogue? What does it mean? This film is not alone. Most movies seem to do it now. For 2 years, I wondered if something was wrong with my TV, but I got a new TV and here it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could take place a block away behind the actors stifles dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was even more distracting in this film because, in the English version, the woman mumbles constantly. I was hoping that Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, do you want to talk or remove the marbles from your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have French in high school, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give him 4 because Reno was so good to Leon. People are crazy about the landscape, but I saw it on television and lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
