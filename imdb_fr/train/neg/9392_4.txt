... and Ethel Merman's fans will also like her strong, authoritative voice as a wicked Mombi witch, but this cartoon sequence of "The Wizard of Oz" is devoid of real imagination, substituting fantasy and fantasy. excitement at a noisy action (and at a lower cost repeating his images as a bad music video). Little Dorothy is sent back to Oz, which is in ruins, and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation is wedged somewhere between Walt Disney, the weaker, and the less inspired Hanna-Barbera shows, but many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet lament, "It's a distant land" , beautifully interpreted by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for its energy, which is why the film has its place every time Dorothy is present. A lot of it is immutable, and I'm not sure if baby boomers will be paying for it, because traffic has been interrupted for so long. As an object of curiosity, just right. ** from ****
