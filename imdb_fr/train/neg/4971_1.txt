I work in a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies coming in with just a few copies, that's the kind of movies the Sci-Fi channel shows. The kind of movie that nobody wants, and that only praise the idiots, when they report it, I ask them "was it good?", They say "no, we turned it off after 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible monsters generated by computer, super imposed and others, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> It's the same type of film as Grendel, and an absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonable (and only reasonable) price for a good film based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel with Gerard Butler, who also plays in the highly anticipated 300, under the title King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Later, we have another film about Beowulf, with a cast of stars like Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let that give you hope as we all did with Eragon, or we're all in for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And as far as rentals are concerned, here is my general rule: if there are only one or two copies, do not rent it because it's a load of shit. (That's true 99.9% of the time, usually false if the title is foreign or documentary.)
