I think the different comments on this thread have allowed to collect a clue. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the number of people who liked this film and want to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory". I think this gives us a glimpse of why this movie and its underlying problem are so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The issue of global warming pleases many people who want to force others to "do good". This is particularly pleasing to people who are more "bent" because it has nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, which usually makes the Conservatives force you to "be good". <br /> <br /> problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful at that. He just can not help but appeal to those who want to force others to do what they want. The political appeal is just too important. <br /> <br /> And we still have a scientific problem of paramount importance, reduced to a political problem that seduces the members of the body politic with a predilection to force others. "do the right thing". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the environmental movement was stolen by such people.
