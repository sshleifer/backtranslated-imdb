If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 for a used textbook, not for this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I do not think administrators really understood, but they may have tried to create several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our lives are deterministic; 2) science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) science is really cool, brother; 4) we are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult role to follow and 7) here, put this little square of paper in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.
