In 2002, "I Love the 80's", popular and popular, is a crazy and disgusting mess of silly, idiotic, downright disgusting pop culture, which was the first of a long series of horrendous TV shows that announced the end of VH1, At one time, there remained only the real musical chain! I practically lived on VH1 until spring or winter, I forget which of 2002, when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I guess that's what you call it), I decided to take a look at the first night, even though the ads looked like complete shit. At least, I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed because my expectations were obviously starting for the basement. I discovered that in the first five minutes, I put less emphasis on each year of the 1980s and on what was and was not culturally or popularly significant (which I was expecting to see) but rather an impromptu platform. for a whole series of truly awful comedies to show what they think more than likely to be their comic skills * rolls their eyes * ... more like a lack of it if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly funny and pathetic in their so-called "humor" attempts that I swear I can feel my intestines. tie with each line a riner they pulled one after the other! Overall, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / is a trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons I almost do not look at VH1 anymore.
