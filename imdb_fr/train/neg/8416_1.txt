It makes sense to me that this film is praised for Hollywood because often in Hollywood, it is only a contest of popularity. It is also logical to think that people who love the film may react to countless songs spitting on you rather than the content of the story. Yet this film is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy looks ridiculous. It is out of the question that Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give an Oscar-winning performance, so many people were thrilled BEFORE the movie was released. I can not even believe that Condon is in the process of being nominated for an Oscar for Management when he only made one album. Glitz does not replace a scenario anything. A lot of songs do not make a movie.
