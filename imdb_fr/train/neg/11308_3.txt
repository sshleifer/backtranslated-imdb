<br /> <br /> Get out your breweries and enjoy this flawed action movie. The considerable skills in Speakman's kempo (pretty spin-kicks, decent with chopsticks - poor couch!) Are the only redemptive quality of a film that cries badly. The plot is not half bad; just executed badly enough. But if you see this film for anything other than martial arts, you miss the boat completely. And for a movie supposed to take place in Koreatown, far too few Korean actors (even extras).
