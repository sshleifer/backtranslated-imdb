I rented this movie because I was browsing the horror film section for movies that no one had heard about and could be a jewel. I've seen it, and since I've been a fan of violence and gore, I've got it. He got the EM rating which means: extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally for violence and all the rest, I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme violence, extreme language and nudity. "Extreme violence" has struck my imagination. The film ended up being a nice slasher movie. There were one or two bloody scenes but I saw worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of blood in a movie is not all that matters, right? You have plot too. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing really special about it. Do not rent it. I tell the truth. I can not imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point of saying, "I'm going to rent again." There have been times when it has allowed you to continue but I will never see this movie again.
