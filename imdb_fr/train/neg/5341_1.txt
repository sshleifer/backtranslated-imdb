Bursting with good actors, I was expecting a lot more "Deceiver" than what was delivered. The plot is extremely artificial and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add to the confusion. Credibility flies by the window and, with the end, becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who likes his movies to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid "Deceiver" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm just not hooked enough to get it, but I suspect many others have been totally confused by the scenario and especially by the end. Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the whole movie was meaningless. - MERK
