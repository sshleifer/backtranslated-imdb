This film has successfully proven what we all already know, that professional basketball players fear anything but basketball. Especially rapping and playing. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First of all, is it just me or is it the ugliest kid you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry while, even if he has magical powers, he is terribly afraid of making music? Third, I read the Bible. In no case was it said that Jesus made geniuses. Fourth, what was the problem with all the special effects of shit? I assure you that any nervous acne teenager with a computer could produce better effects than that. Fifth, why did the end suck so badly? And what is a djin? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam must be ejected from the plane and placed on the Eiffel Tower, because this film raises the word "suck" to a whole new level.
