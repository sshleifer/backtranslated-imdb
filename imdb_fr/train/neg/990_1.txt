Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about travelers who got trapped in a cave). So we decided to look at it anyway thinking that it could not be so bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was produced and made public. It was so horrible that it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you can not do yourself. Honestly, I feel emotionally scarred. It was a low-budget film in which a student was attacked by a boy with whom she went out and turned to a porn movie. And really not a good one. I hated this woman's rapist and felt almost bad for him. Almost. In the end, a horrible movie that was rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your kids watch it.
