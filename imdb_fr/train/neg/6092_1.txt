Someone had to joke around making this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is an absolute impossibility that this film was shot in 1993. Fashion and music dictate that it is indeed the 80s. My assumption is that this stayed on the shelf for a long time before an insane distributor took it and published it in an incredulous world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Type of. A strange loner meets a man with a random beard who tells him that if he meditated singing his favorite song, he could turn into whoever he wanted. At this point, I feel obliged to point out that this loner's favorite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is it his favorite song? Because he's an idiot. We are only a minute in the film and the film has already reached a level of monumental stupidity. It becomes even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The solitary is the nostril collector. I can only assume that because there are two scenes in the film where he is seen breaking his nose. This clarifies the title. He decides to turn into a girl to be able to approach other girls. And kill them. It's more or less that. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally appalling. Every performance in this movie is void. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the acting is the quality of a pornographic film. It's really terrible. The nostril selector appears to the public as the nostril selector. The characters in the film see him as the girl he has become singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even by typing this. Anyway, it's a little strange to see a middle-aged lunatic coming out with schoolgirls. And not in a good way. There is even a prolonged montage of scenes where the nostril coach is at school with the girls and a song is playing on top. It's probably the worst song ever recorded. I will not even describe it. You will know it when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of violence, of course. And there is a Benny Hill-style chase sequence involving a transsexual. There is even an immortal dialogue, which may or may not have been borrowed from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril attendant says to a prostitute, "I have money if you have the hack." Charming, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Absurdity.
