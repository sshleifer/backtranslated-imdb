I own almost all Seagal movies (yes, even those like this one that have a small budget), and I have to say that this can be the worst, not only of his films, but of all the movies ever made. The only highlight of this movie, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that it's A. it's Seagal, and B. Seagal has some nice footage. actions, especially in the store, and also every time he takes out an entire army with a knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes of killings in Seagal, and do not bother with a story, because the plot is not only stinking, but acting, too, the fact that the F-18s and F-14s turned into F-16s, and the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also the Stealth never had to fill up ??? And since when is Afghanistan considered a hostile territory from the point of view of the Air Force? At the latest news, Afghanistan does not have an air force, we (the United States) control the sky. In addition, this top-secret mission was entrusted to all the crew members present in the room via loudspeakers. Yet the admiral always whispers to the other man that it's secret. Also, how did Seagal get from the bottom of the truck to the top? Tell us why they jailed him. Since when are the pilots of the air force great commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are they drunk in the Arab countries, considering that the Muslims do not drink 'alcohol? In addition, since when do the Arabs listen to the orders of women as No. 2 in charge? The highlight of the film is without a doubt Seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
