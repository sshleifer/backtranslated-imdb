I was disappointed, man. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller in "Friends" <br /> <br /> 2) A beautiful cast is lost Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur scenario . <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from a horrible rhythm. He jumps through in a confusing and confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) History does not even make sense. Why does he want to break the football series? What about stupid violin music? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a group of accountants trying to improvise, saying, "Look at me, look at me, I'm funny!" It was a bad attempt to create another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's films, but he failed here. I could not wait for the credits to roll. Horribly disappointed.
