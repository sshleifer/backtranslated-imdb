As usual, on IMDb, moving to the majority of voices instead of the "weighted average" is much more indicative of the entertainment value of the film. In this case, the majority gives him a "one". How right they are! To begin my criticism, I must first admit that I do not understand why this movie is titled "Alien Intruder". This implies space and even an "alien" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long run, at least, no basis for conspiracy or no resolution that I can find anywhere. <BR /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious (in terms of both the lines, the timing and the way they are spoken) that they far exceed the strange feeling that you get when you watch really bad movies. I have no idea of ​​this part of the beginning where an electronic Bunny Bugs seems to complain about something. <br /> <br /> "The plot" only involves a space called "G-spot", sorry, make sure G-Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected by some kind of extraterrestrial virus (?) . I think it's strange since Ariel's image, which is normally normal, appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, we see people being shot with space weapons, falling from lofts and seemingly endless. , useless close-ups of "Where is Ariel?", "I can not find Ariel" (useless because most other plans include an interaction with Ariel, anyway - whatever it is) on a computer screen. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits and observes each fantasy of the convict's virtual reality programs in hopes of finding this Alien virus and being one with him ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took a few lessons on "how to act in despair" before filming. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers over his face and looking sad. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the nose of a ship passing behind each other was half hilarious. less, and planned to laugh in addition to the first scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is spinning in a circle, much like a Lego experience that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems everyone is dying in this movie, so why bother? Even women of the RV are killed, as if that was supposed to mean something (especially that all the others die anyway) ... outrageous. to want to recover my money that I paid for the DVD of this. The dollar I saved on this vanilla wafer bag paid off for this review. <br /> <br /> I will simply add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with much more detail, could probably be very interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
