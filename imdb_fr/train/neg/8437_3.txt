As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his debut film, House of Games, which also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things with this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the superficiality of the film and its lack of credibility. Racial slurs are launched without any sentiment or meaning behind them, in the hope of creating a racial tension that for me has never materialized. Identity is totally reevaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths to the cop, the main character categorically refuses to perform a relatively small action that would not harm anyone and that could possibly save lives, while performing another very violent and VERY illegal but refusing action. all the same, the minor. action. In addition, an extremely incredible sub-plot involving a man who killed his family is presented just for a plot point that was almost advertised with hidden scriptures, and the officer's response to this event far exceeds the limits of credibility. Needless to say, after waiting for another David Mamet thriller, I was extremely disappointed. 3 out of 10
