Another IMDb user, in a message now removed, said anyone likely to see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned of a scene that is reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced "LA Confidential", an Oscar nominee, and screenwriter John Briley, who won an Oscar for "Gandhi". ") and an international film. I found that "The Medusa Touch" was a riot of heavy and involuntary laughter. It was a misdirected mess, horribly written and played. He tried to capitalize on the telekinetic thrillers genre of the 70s. The film fails in many ways. Please consider "Carrie" and the underrated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject.
