It's a very economical werewolf movie. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a junk of clich√©s with the usual characters like the hard detective who shoots the werewolves with his silver handgun! [filled of course with silver balls]. The game is as wooden as the characters. FX is non-existent, many extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and bites. the only thing shown is a lot of T & A soft-core. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe, discover a very nice recent picture of werewolf: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
