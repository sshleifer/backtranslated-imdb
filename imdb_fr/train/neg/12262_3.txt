Fans of feature films must endure a lot of terrible movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid and redundant paper scum horrors on ridiculously big animals that want to upset the food chain. The crocodiles were particularly successful because we had to make our way through the abominable Crocodile (led by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is just as bad as these other movies and ?? in addition to that ?? he likes to exaggerate a lot. The marine crocodile is said to be 90 years old, more than 30 feet long (!) And he kills for fun! During the movie, he enjoys devouring a group of completely stupid surfers and dudettes who came for new sensations while surfing in a crowded area of ​​sharks. The only beautiful aspect of this film is its tropical location. Even if it is a setting totally inappropriate for a film like this, the lagoons and the nature are magnificent. All other aspects are simply disastrous. There is a bit of gore but all this looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen! You will not believe some of the lines that these actors have to say! I know that surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters calls Jaws a "mechanical toy", but the crocodile seems at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects of "Blood Surf" are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I will not say more about the acting because it is secondary in movies like this one. The girls are sexy in wet shirts and their breasts bounce happily as they flee the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. Too bad, it becomes funny again. But "funny" for quite a different reason than James Hickox had planned.
