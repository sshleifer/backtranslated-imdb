AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director has cut his best scenes. In the scenes where she is, she is only a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot similar to a sub-plot in "Get Carter", but she handles it better in "Get Carter" (I blame the director). The director's tribute to Hitchcock was cheesy. (This is the scene where Ryan Philippe's character realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin's character, at least I think it's a homage to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows scenes that have I think the director should trust his instinct and not listen to the test hearings.
