Simply, I found the television series "Mash" banal, preached, oh so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the greatest of all sins, and that is,? that it was (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main role, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his intelligence, that it made me feel uncomfortable to even try to miss an episode . The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, which I gladly admit to having some panache and some style in the presentation of their characters. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely, look like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread bread. Loretta Swit, who I found boring, had no complaints, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the film, was tired of watching and acting as the show unfolded. Seeing a show a year proved it to me. Jamie Farr was just "comedy" down-and-out and not worth mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give him one (one) note, which anyone who reads this now would ask, is that any notation, whatever it may be, is not just a subjective call, but a relative commentary. Television, with a few exceptions, is so raw. This relatively speaking, Mash had a certain quality of production (by television standards) of that time and today, and so it deserves two years.
