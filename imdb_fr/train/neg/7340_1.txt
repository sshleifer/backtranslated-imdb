Impressed! It's the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie got worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except SRK of course, even if he can not save the movie), and not very sensible. The director gives an impression of confusion to God, God knows why ... Maybe because he tries to make all this surreal and yet credible. Well, he does not manage either. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to spare, do not watch this movie, please! (Say this for your own well-being!) Keep looking, you'll find something else to watch!
