When Ritchie entered the world of film, his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. If one could compare the hype that he generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal disgust his last two releases have created, it should be taken into account: was Ritchie discovered? Is he really that talent? Does he really have real original ideas? Or is he just a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, all in one huge, disorganized pile? After watching Revolver, one could apologize for thinking that all this went wrong? What happened to her great sense of humor? Where did he find all these mixed and complicated ideas? Revolver tries to be intelligent, philosophical and succinct, he tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, he tries to be a complex and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a gigantic effort to achieve all these many goals and invests large parts of a script in existential reflections and many twists and turns. However, in the end, all he serves is to build a very unstructured, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly movie for the audience. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that, although Ritchie at least tries to make his own turn, he should be punished for even trying to pass it off for his own work. So, what the audience ultimately gets is a dreadful scenario, mixed with many pretentious oneliners and heavy centerpieces. <br /> <br /> Revolver is finally a film without originality and bland that has stolen a multitude of themes in masterpieces such as Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. He's aiming high, but inevitably, doing blank shots. <br /> <br /> The revolver deserves to be blasted, it is a really mediocre film which masquerades as a spooky masterpiece. However, he falls flat on his ridiculous face and simply does not achieve everything he wants to be and achieve.
