This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another speaker, who said the special effects were acceptable. I found them rather bad: it was just not realistic and they were so wrong that they simply distracted the story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is why I did not understand the story well. Archaeologists are looking for "the decor". They do not bother to say which set or what is so special. This also explains why they are looking for it in California, while the film's intro takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you make a film that takes place in the desert, take the effort. to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the old ceremony - seems to have been shot inside a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action has been constant throughout the film, no ups and downs, no climax. The film looked short, and it's definitely a pro for this particular movie.
