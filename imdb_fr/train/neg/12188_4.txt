Although I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I always personally felt that Martin Scorsese was just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in many of his films seems to shout, "Look at me, am I not an imaginative director?" His best film I've seen is the one with the fewest novelties, the superlative "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this remake, it seems that things have happened as usual. The dull film stock reflecting the 1950s decor was so bland that it was a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with a sub-par imitation of the classic "Psycho" are more likely to provoke ridicule than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score of "Psycho" was brilliantly disconcerting, this "tribute" has just a high and annoying sound. Even the actors, who can sometimes be decent, offer histrionic performances that only shout "caricature"; The notable exception to this is Lewis's intelligent turn as an impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender who acts here is surprisingly De Niro. Of course, he looks threatening, but as soon as he opens his mouth, that aura disappears. Now, I am not an expert on American accents. Me, I come from the Manchester area, England, but he would surely have been able to come up with a southern draw more convincing than that? As a talented physical actor, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting for me, as a fan of De Niro, to wish to be off the screen rather than thrilled with his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) <br /> <br /> -the style of the entire film extends to the ridiculously exaggerated end. When will Scorsese learn that minimizing the situation can sometimes create tension as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sound bombardment? I also thought he was a well-respected reputation for using this cheap trick that less talented people could use. <br /> <br /> In summary, a "thriller" completely ridiculous. Scorsese and De Niro worked much better together.
