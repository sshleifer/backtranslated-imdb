When I was a teenager, seeing this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason is that Bo Derek and his various states of undressing in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is awful. Note that Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and her husband director, John Derek, make sure to see her in abundance. But when you remove this aspect of the film, it becomes a big boring trick. And Tarzan, well, he's just as muscular as you think, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This is despite the fact that Bo is wearing a see-through transparent shirt, with his chest clearly visible. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet to have this problem. If you are looking for a film that slides on a beautiful naked body, you may be wasting your time. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and interesting movie, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else !!!
