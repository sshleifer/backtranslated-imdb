Although the likelihood that someone will focus on this comment among those 80 and older for this film is small, I feel I have to say something about it. I am not the kind of viewer who pays particular attention to the value of production, the thoughtful dialogue, or the brilliant interpretation and realization. However, I claim that this film is nil. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean, he has almost everything I want in a horror movie: blood, excess, unintentional humor, and so on. Still, Zombi 3 is a Baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many things that make you scream on the screen. For example, when the girl leaves the army when the car breaks down to find water (it does not spoil anything, do not worry). She enters what I consider an abandoned hotel or something. Did not she see that there was a friggin lake in the middle of the building ??? Yes, she looks for water and passes a lake. Why? Because she wants to know why people (who are not here because the place is abandoned) will not answer her when she shouts, "Is there anyone?" Oh, this is just an insignificant little piece of the big picture I'm painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, however, why I gave this movie more than one star. It's one of those movies where, if you forget how serious it is, as I've done a few times, you'll want to see it again because it's so great in every way. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of blood. In addition, it also contains strange creatures: a zombie baby (with an adult hand) and a magic head just to name two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you're trying to think about the worst films and cheeses ever made and imagine sci-fi movies from the 50's? I think Zombi 3 and films like this should be part of it. It contains all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is the 9th plan of the 80s! I will not say it's a waste of money if you want to buy it, but expect the worst. And when you discover that expecting the worst underestimates Zombi 3, it will not be so bad. You might actually like that, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate this movie, I do not ... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) reigns! (Have I just blown my credibility?)
