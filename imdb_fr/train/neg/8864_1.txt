After watching this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (it has happened over time). This movie was a total trash. First, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howling", with an incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot is nil and the whole movie is just AWFUL !!!! A brother of a werewolf victim of the first film (At first sight, he was supposed to be Dee Wallace Stone) teamed up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money watching nudity.). Try to catch it on the cable instead. It would be so chopped that it could actually make sense.
