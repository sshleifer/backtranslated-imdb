Reading all these positive reviews, I am perplexed. How come so many people have appreciated what I consider to be a terribly bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? The film poses many problems, already mentioned in some critics; In other words, it is a hammered, exaggerated and restless mess that goes from the generic to the butcher's end. <br /> <br /> While many characters are misinterpreted and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette embark on a performance worthy of them, the worst is Paltrow. I really enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-aware, nasal, slumped and totally disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - even if a perfect Emma could not have saved this movie.
