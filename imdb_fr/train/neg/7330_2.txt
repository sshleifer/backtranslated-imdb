Kill Me Later "has an interesting first principle: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) about to jump from the top of an office building protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill her later ".> <br /> The actual fulfillment of this premise, however, falls flat because almost every action serves as a simple way to advance the plot towards its predictable conclusion.Passibly written characters who have no motivation for their compromising behaviors the lack of depth of the character particularly diminishes the performance of Selma Blair, whose character, Shawn, goes from cold to morose and finally becomes a confused idiot.It is unfortunate, because in others circumstances, Mrs. Blair is an attractive and capable actress. <br /> <br /> Director Dana Lustig's insistence on the use of fast cuts, incongruous special effects (for example, search hilarious infrared motorcycle at the end) is an aggravating factor, and a trendy soundtrack hoping to appeal to the little attention of the MTV crowd. Admittedly, Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of the staging, but his skills do not in any way to overcome the problems inherent in the film. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; However, it may be more appropriate for music videos than for movies. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be congratulated for their ability to make this film: they managed to lose $ 1.5 million to finance the film, ensure a good distribution, and get a national and foreign distribution. This is no mean feat for an independent film. Yet, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
