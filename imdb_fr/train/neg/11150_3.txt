I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and it was the full moon outside! I did not do it on purpose, it happened like that. So, all the elements were there for this film to scare me !! In fact, I did not want to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought I could continue, but unfortunately, I did it. The acting was awful, Samaire Armstrong was the only one to have a good one. The plot is not original, if you're a horror fan, it's exactly the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense and you just feel that the director wants to make the film longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The scenes (scary) seemed to belong to a horror movie of the 80s, when there was not enough technology, but good movies had already been shot! I was surprised to see the name of a big production company at the beginning of the film. I thought they could not invest some money in this project and make it decent! !! I totally agree with the ratings given by the film, it's also my rating, 3 out of 10.
