Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like "The Man of Planet X", it's a strange sci-fi tale from an era when fantasy and science fiction were still at the same level. Which means that we have very laughable special effects and a creepy pseudo-science pretending to be science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" from a high quality transfer with a clean image and a clean sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> The main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time our space team is on Mars. (What, you thought "Angry Red Planet" was referring to Neptune?) Previously, there was a poor-quality space crew that boarded a spacecraft, inside which they smoked and chatted around. a chauvinistic sexist joke targeting the "shabby woman" of the crew. It would be a little shocking compared to current standards if it was not so funny. But Mars is the real reason we are watching this thing. The film is usually black and white, but Mars, well, Mars screams bloody red. It is filmed in this strange red plastic glow that gives the angry red planet a pretty interesting aspect of overexposed redness. It's really a show - just like the (ha ha) extraterrestrials that viewers have to witness. The best being the "ratbatspidercrab". You think it's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (small puppet) that combines traits of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. He goes around every puppy and scares the sh * t of our "heroic crew". There are other extraterrestrials strange and badly imagined to see, but this one takes the cake. Finally, after their poignant experience on Mars, the sexist crew board their "ship" and return to the planet they come from. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Science Fiction moviegoers and curiosity seekers, as well as some movie buffs in general. The fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will spend a busy day with it (if they have never seen it during the performance). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 in total. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
