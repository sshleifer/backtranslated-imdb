Johnny Weissmuller's latest film as "King of the Jungle", after 16 years in the role of TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, can only disappoint all fans, with the exception of his most ardent. At 44, the ex-Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active "party-goers," had long since surpassed the slender athleticism of his youth and looked tired (though in a slightly better state than from his previous entry, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only Weissmuller has become too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the "boy" par excellence, had become a man (he was 17 years old), so he was written in the script, under the pretext of being "absent at school". Brenda Joyce, 35, appeared in her fourth of her five films as "Jane" (she would transition to Lex Barker as TARFAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN in 1949) and remained as sexy as ever . > <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, at RKO, with a tiny budget, the actors and the technical team took advantage of a cheaper workforce by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic look to what was supposed to be the darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey used the country extensively, integrating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into history. <br /> <br /> When an island girl (Tyrone Power's future wife, Linda Christian) is saved in a river in the jungle by Tarzan. He learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the most enduring villains in the film) has virtually enslaved the local population, threatening revenge for a living "God". they do not do his orders. The girl had been chosen to become the wife of 'God', so she ran away. "It's a stupid plot or WHAT?", The girl is kidnapped by the priest's servants and sent back to the island. Tarzan, followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish character "Benjy" (charming rendition of John Laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner goes to take the deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the "god" is simply a masked conman with an Aztec mask, working with the priest to milk the rich pearl beds of the island), a little fight, comic relief and Benjy's songs everything goes to the end. Happy conclusion expected. <br /> <br /> Remarkably, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS presents a score of the brilliant composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and is much better than what you expect from this movie 'B'! <br /> <br /> While the film would provide a less than auspicious end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately play in Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variant of Ape Man, in Khaki), the talent in gambling allowed the overall product to be at least a little above the total mess that it could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to get a new look and become a lot sexier ...
