Besides, one of the worst films ever made. Land goes as follows. Cross the jungle for about 10 minutes. Ask Bo to go somewhere and undress. Slip a little deeper into the jungle. Give Bo another excuse to undress. Back in the jungle. Oh look! There is a guy looking for Tarzan! Strip, Bo - band. Kill the safaris. Tarzan is looking for a fight scene. Record Bo. Bo bands. Run credits. Run credits, run.
