I only watched it because the film was directed by Lucio Fulci and starred Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that doomed convicts fight to death for ratings on television has been exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie, Death Race, which will certainly Nobody because Jason Statham is the star. <br /> <br /> It was a nuisance for most. The action "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. The "training" was a rehearsal party. It just did not catch me and made me want to worry about anyone, including Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the other people mentioned and you will be better off.
