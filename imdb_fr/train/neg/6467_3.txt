I still can not believe this movie. They have so many incredible things that it's hard to believe anyone wants to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but it makes sense to be funny, but does not look like a story. How can you mix a burlesque comedy with a train robbery, a movie about the prison, city plots, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> Beside the terrifying direction, the most remarkable thing is that of the actors. I watched this movie and thought, 'Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is it Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is real. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This film is a pity for everyone. (At the end). No, no, no, that absolutely can not be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it was over and I got angry. So many good actors, generally Oscar winners and convincing, in such a stupid, stupid and awful film. I rarely wanted to know how much they had come to play in this one. They could not have so much money. <br /> <br /> Only a stupid and stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
