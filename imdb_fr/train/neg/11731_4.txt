As far as I'm concerned, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness, love or spirituality in this version, it's all macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me that the Nazis were in love; we do not care? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one, we see John Gilbert and his rude parent, the coveted prince after this ridiculous American actress, portrayed by Mae Murray, endowed with a permanent permanent hairstyle and an incredible feminist way that has thrown me over and over again. . I like my novels light and beautiful, with slow climbs; not hard and sadistic like this one. And go, these bees stung lips, get rid of it, girl! <br /> <br /> Go to a performance of the show if you want to have a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz Lehar's original operetta. If not, wait for TCM to display the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version. It's much better.
