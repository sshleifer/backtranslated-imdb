What a missed opportunity to make an interesting film about a complex subject. There is very little exploration of how you actually feel as a heterosexual (or gay) man working in a gay sex environment. The dancers continue to talk about their art as if it contained no erotic component. They may not all be hired prostitutes, but they are sex workers who play fantasies and sell private sessions where more than dancing is offered. The film gives the impression that they attract mostly women who go to gay clubs and end up hiring "dancers" for private sessions. Even the plans in the club show only the women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only play for the women of the public. It's just not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to make a living by doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their admirers and gay customers? We learn very little. Instead, we get filling. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of heterosexual dancers. A manager who talks to us about costumes for drag numbers, but gives no idea of ​​the life and attitudes of the dancers. <br /> <br /> The images of Mexico are generic. The phallic montage showing the cooking of sausages is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simplistic film that should only interest those who want to see some pictures of pretty boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
