I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. Much too predictable of a story with the potential to be funny, but rather falls flat on his face. You see, 19 words, however, I did not completely sweep this movie with a single star, but I decided to move it to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking heavily and has provided just enough treats to keep me from tearing myself out the DVD from the machine and blow it up with an M80. My advice, take the rental fee of $ 4.00 that you would have paid to see this movie and send it to me as an advance, thank you for saving you time and avoiding the frustration of having to sit down to cross this train wreck. me, the replacement fee of $ 50.00 that you would have been charged for taking out your template of twelve to use this waste as practice clay pigeon shooting.
