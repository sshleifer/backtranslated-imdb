After enduring this inaccurate film, I admit that it is a more modern story than the previous versions. Still, it is so inaccurate and has been made so politically correct that it made me angry after watching it. Davy Crockett was very badly represented by Billy Bob, who, in my opinion, would have been better interpreted by the role of Sam Houston given the passion of the two men for the oratory. I think egocentric Dennis Quaid (a Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and that would certainly have fueled his venerated sense of self-veneration. As a Texan and a strong supporter of the Texas mentality, I think Davy Crockett was the Texan par excellence, even though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is "It's not boastful if it's a fact" was made for Crockett. And this last scene at Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor must be the biggest insult ever made to Davy Crockett. It is ridiculous to suggest that this giant of man and veteran fighter is let live. Three different eyewitness accounts place him dead among the bodies of a dozen Mexican soldiers who died after fierce fighting. Finally, this lame end of the film is supposed to portray the Battle of San Jacinto as a reciprocal battle of 600 Texicans against 700 Mexican soldiers while there were actually more than 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. All Texan schoolchildren who pay attention to their first Texas history class know that the battle took the Mexican army by surprise at the time of the nap and that the Mexican army was so confused that it could not forming ranks and escaped without being dragged by hand.
