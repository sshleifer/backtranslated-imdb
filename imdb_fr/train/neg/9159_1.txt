If an author gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 credits before the beginning of the film, and the foreground shows the author rolling on a bed in lycra shorts, it will come as no surprise that this author has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of look that could be helpful to a therapist for homosexual aversion. <br /> <br /> Others have given this thing the feel it deserves. For me, the most pitiful moment happened when LA's trip was signaled by a plane landing at what appeared to be LAX; and the return was reported by firing a Fedex cargo plane.
