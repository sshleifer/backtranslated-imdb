I can not even believe that this show lasted so long. I guess it's all part of the fall of America. Personally, as David Spade said, I preferred this show when it bore its original title - "Seinfeld". What bothers me the most in this series, aside from the obvious sense of "humor" and general finesse, is the pretentious way in which the episodes are titled. Real shows are always funny after many repeated screenings, such as "the one where Rob is accidentally hypnotized", the "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor for viewers of excellent programs. That the writers and producers of "Friends" have the absolute pride to titrate the episodes themselves, in this way, even before anyone has even had the chance to see it a second time, not only denounces the mediocrity and the lack of original thought on the part of these writers, but also of the frozen mind of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You read the comments of some of these people and you can not come to the conclusion that they live in a map resembling Neverland, full of feelings of greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people are supposed to work in cafes and look for work as actors, but still manage to live with $ 4,000 / month. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all this. New York does not exist for anyone who earns less than a serious six-figure income. But good luck with all this, anyway. Now, close and pass the Soma.
