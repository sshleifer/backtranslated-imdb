Madhur gave us a powerful movie, Chandni Bar, in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. He apparently tells the story of some high-class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to play the lead role in a movie. I wanted to spit and break the DVD. Coincidentally, I did it. The reason the film contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing, it was not necessary to show the children completely naked. One of the rich likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British in this film. I'm shocked to know that this movie was a hit in parts of India, if not Super Flop in the UK, US and Australia. I come from the UK and that kind of thing makes me sick. I should not go out in the UK.
