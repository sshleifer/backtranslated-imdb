You were messed up and beaten in submission by my tough statements on the "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" movies! Now comes another breed of disappointing rediscoveries: ninja movies! I've seen a lot of these videos before, and let me tell you it's not all we can crack! They do not usually stick to the goal. This, among all the others, does not suffer from any originality! What does a ninja have to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And is not it supposed to be a "martial arts" film? Does a lot of shots sound like an incredible action movie for you? Is blood the number one reason to love it to death? Will you lose some of your hard-earned money for a lady singing in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions can be found in NINJA'S MISSION, which should be included in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more fun nonsense ninja, try watching these Godfrey Ho movies published by Trans World. You get what you deserve and it's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
