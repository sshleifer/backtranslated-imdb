You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The safety pin killer! It's true, in Killer Workout, a silent film that has already hit the nail, the invisible killer sends his victims with an oversized safety pin. It's a strange choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film never even tries to specify where the killer has acquired such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is besieged by a crazy killer and everyone is suspicious. In fact, the film gives so little clue to the identity of the murderer, just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they are killed. And since just about everyone, except the murderer, is dead, it is actually a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, while the whole name is killed, the aerobics classes are continuing seriously. In fact, nothing is able to stop the dance. While three men are murdered in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; a character dies, but is still visible during subsequent training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he was named the Killer Workout movie and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Lawsuits against cops, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of photos of women's exposed skin are projected for good measure. A bit like the woman caught in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Killer Workout. Finally, thankfully, the end flashed on the screen. What happened next? You have the plans of working women. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
