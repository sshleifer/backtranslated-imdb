Here is an independent film that I really wanted to love but that I could not finally. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows and kills the photo. The story is a crazy mess that is not worth trying to understand. I quickly got bored in 10 minutes, then I suffered for the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping everything would be fine - before hitting the chapter stops to (thankfully) go all the way ... even though it was not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE obviously tries to be too smart, pulling its best sequences of EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has been done before, and better. This film would have been much more fun as a short film of 10 to 20 minutes, but as a feature film, it feels just padded and constrained. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I suppose motivated the decision to extend the term to more than 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer is very promising and I wish him good luck.
