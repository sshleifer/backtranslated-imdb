What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You gather a group of friends at home, marveling at Sean Ellis' follow-up work. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no revealers that could kill the pleasure, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes pass and you start telling yourself that you have to go back, at 25 minutes, you wonder if you should just fall asleep and save it for another time, when you can fully appreciate subtle keys that do not exist. After half an hour, you realize that half of your emotional public is already asleep and call it one day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you exhaust all the equipment you need to look at you in the middle of the day, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later, you quickly find yourself in front of incredibly long images and intermediate transitions. I would have given up something else, but there is cashback and its legacy. But this legacy can not last so long. This is a new level of boring movie making. Imagine a novel that would extend to a novel with just descriptions. That's what it is. <br /> <br /> A decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you impressed like cashback either. There are films that bother you, there are films that are lacking in certain aspects, or just plain old, unfortunately it's only a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Last words, stay away.
