An American family bickering on vacation in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. They do not know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence pursues them. I usually like mystery horror movies like this one. Spielberg's "Cube", "Duel" and "The Birds" are excellent examples of films that give no answer but leave us nevertheless intrigued and eager to find out more. Apparently, the screenwriter / director of "Disappearance", Walter Klenhard, was trying to make this kind of film, and the viewer did not succeed. Personally, I think he traveled about half the way, and then the film went down. <br /> <br /> The actors are somehow "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad, but as an audience, we never really feel their fear and react to situations unrealistically. Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters who are just leaving to investigate strange sounds?!?!? Give them at least some kind of justification for doing it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As for movies made for television, this is an average just above the average. Director Klenhard should be congratulated for truly treating the desert in all that he offers and some of the scenery is striking. There is a really cool scene where two characters discover an old nuclear test where the sand was completely melted in glass as far as the eye can see. I wonder if it was true? <br /> <br /> No gore to talk about, and the "creatures" - or anything else after these people - are never shown, not to mention we're not never give a clue what they are (mutants, extraterrestrials, ghosts or evil old Indian spirits? Oh, that really reduces it for us!) or where do they come from. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of clich√©s here too. Why are the townspeople in this kind of movies always really, really stupid? Why is there always an old man that everyone finds crazy and turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? What about a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "The disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent, but ultimately fails because, in many ways, she is too familiar to us, the fans of the horror movie. Hey, I've seen much worse movies, and the disappearance is not that bad, it's just too much ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
