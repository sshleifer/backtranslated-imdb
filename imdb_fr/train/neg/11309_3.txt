Bad plot (although good for a B movie), good scenes of fast fighting, at most a 5 out of 10. But this film has always bothered me: how is it that Mariska Hargitay never speaks? In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Yet, in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut off and she never talks at all. It bothers me because it removes not only a feminine (though cliched) point of view on the film, but also gives a terrifying aspect to the final shot. This film would have been better if they had kept his scenes, because at least those scenes have a personality that understates everything Speakman says.
