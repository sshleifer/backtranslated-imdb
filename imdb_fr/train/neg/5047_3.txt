I was not really going to comment, but then I thought I had something to say. I saw this film two days ago and, although I think it's not a waste of time (it could have been money for the producers), it's obvious that serious problems. There is a very good cinematography and a (small but) good music. We talked a lot about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest, for what? She is not really an actress and she constantly balances between sur-actor and ridiculous sub-actor. His performance goes for good because there has never been someone like Odete in another movie: crazy? sad? childish? an impostor? nobody knows, guys. So, she is a little bit dictating the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was also a good example of the problem that most Portuguese films face: the soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is that usual mass of noise coming out of nowhere. People in other countries may think that Portugal is the noisiest place. What pleased me, however, was that some parts of the dialogue were doubled, but that did not necessarily resolve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I must say. It's strange to see a movie in which the first thing that strikes me in the first scene, when the first character speaks, is: it's doubled. And all that to say that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> It also has scripting problems. He tries to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and it shows. The writer obviously tried to make everything clear and he does it but ... it shows! All dialogues are too exposed and there is not a single speech that looks like a line of a movie. Everything is a little raw and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film is a complete mess, I must emphasize. I just think that the good sides are so obvious that I prefer to focus on the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Management brings little to the weak scenario. All plans are classic and not innovative, but beautiful. By the way, great work by Rui Po√ßas. <br /> <br /> Now, what I thought was THE problem, the one that prevents people from believing this story and making people laugh all the way through the movie instead of taking it seriously: play the guy who dies n 'is obviously not an actor. In fact, it's a pretty important role and I do not see why non-actors are chosen for such roles. This guy is neither an actor nor a handsome man. Which means that all the film rolls down the mountain, because we never believe for a second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him even if he is gone, and that his hunky lover who survives really struggles to overcome his loss when we see this character is apathy. Pity. The world is filled with beautiful people who are even beautiful lovers seductive. The world is filled with good actors who are also cute boys and able to provoke obsessions in people after their departure. The world is full of great movies and less good films. It's life!
