In this apocalypse strangely devoid of sensuality, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to care about it in this Grade Z movie that looks less like that of Sheridan Le Fanu than my mother's . recipe. Bored attendants always run the gas stations, doctors always make house calls, and attentive policemen always come in with the radiator fluid when you need it. The plot, and I use this term vaguely, involves a father and a girl trying to surrender with "the general", whose daughter has disappeared, to a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, travels with the father and girl. I must admit that a moment or two of authentic humor is between vast expanses of unintentional humor. The film also offers just enough nudity to interest a fourteen-year-old boy. Any older person beware.
