In fact, I went to see this movie at the theater, but what a waste of time and money! I'm sorry I can not play with this bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go see this movie because James Redfield, the author of the book, was very strongly involved in the script. They really enjoyed the book, so the movie had to be perfect. I was hoping maybe a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I left, I had to throw up and worst of all, there will be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
