The film industry is a delicate business - because you have to make decisions and everyone involved also has a private life. Such is the very original thesis of this weak attempt to make a film "insightful" about the film. And indeed, nothing proves better the ruse of the industry than to see Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell trapped in this inanity. Insight consists of talking heads that joke bullshit such as "should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I create an independent piece and stay true to my own art?" "Do the last, please." Or: "Our relationship is not only professional, it's also private, it's a pretty complex situation to manage, is not it?" "Yes, it's my dear." Between the insipid dialogues, one sees palm trees, hotel halls and posters of American films (no sign of presence of non-American film on the Croisette). Repetitive sleep sessions are inevitable, giving the film's 100 minutes a long-lasting look. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing to justify her own presence in the setting.
