As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of this series started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat plausible and the relationships described between the Eppes brothers and the father gave the show an interesting advantage. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show started to deteriorate sharply. Most of the math and technology used in crime solving is now gibberish and laughable for everyone involved in science and technology. <br /> <br /> The involvement of the actors is always satisfactory and I can imagine a fair. each episode is still in the money, but in the end, it has degraded into a very unpleasant dish mixing C-level action thriller and police series at the CSI. <br /> If you are going to watch it, go only for the first season and maybe part of the second. Afterwards, I will not waste my time. Myself, I gave the show in the middle of season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> In short , up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his calculations anymore, I will not worry about my accuracy either.
