I sat through this film and I must say that he only managed to hold my attention. The film would have been a little more bearable if I had not had to watch the awful CGI, for future reference to the industry if you used this technology to watch it so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all I've seen is a bad movie that looks nothing like a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In total, the story was not as bad as the CGI. I was quite impressed by the acting and thought the casting was good and a little more information about the characters would have been nice because it would be confusing sometimes, but it's no wonder, as I I said, that only caught my attention, but in all honesty, I wish I missed this one.
