This movie is so amazing! - the premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or other) can fly without leaving a trace and kill as many people as the film indicates is laughable. The vampire himself would not look bad in his place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the actors are so wooden that actors should be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for the day someone makes a decent movie from Steven King's novel (except maybe Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do: lack of money for special effects, mediocre actors, appalling characterization and dialogue. This film is cheap, tacky and fails in everything it tries to do.
