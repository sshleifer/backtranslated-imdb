You know it's going to be a nerdy movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It's been doing the '50s. It's black and white. 3. He does not have an actor name! 4. Cries compensate for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, not to be outdone - this film has brilliantly incorporated the four elements above to make it a real cinematic blunder. <br /> <Ok - hush, but I'm going to discuss the special effects here - or their absence - <br /> <br /> Have you seen the underwater scenes? It looks like it was badly filmed in an aquarium - note the heading that floats in the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated reuse of Stock Footage, (exterior shots of the house, bridge scenes - well heightened the KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not since "PLAN 9" - have I ever seen a such creative use of archive footage. <br /> <br /> And good where there was a lack of special effects - do not worry - screaming Yes, this movie even cleverly used this old trick of hug. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - knock out your brain (several fermented drinks help DEFINITELY), sit down, and wonder: why the hell did they film this movie again? <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
