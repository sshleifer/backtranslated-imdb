It must be one of the best anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown the "End of Evangelion" and it still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless scams of this show! <br /> <br /> It does not bother me with the psychological tone and philosophy, but Evangelion drags him crazy! Few characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Apart from that, most people were a bunch of whiny losers. They must go to a psychiatric center, not pilot giant robots against aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even mecha and foreign fights have not helped at all. It looks like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool because they bleed (!) When they hurt themselves, but they are not really mecha, but captured angels, so sometimes they go crazy and do not do what the underage drivers want, and they have to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm really sorry, but I can not just recommend Evangelion to anyone. , anime otakus or not. For those who like this series a lot, although you are entitled to this opinion, I respect you. But for those who have an "insane" obsession to think that everyone will love this series, you are more of an egoist. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
