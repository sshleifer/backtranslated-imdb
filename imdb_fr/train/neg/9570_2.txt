For the first time in years, I felt the need to connect to IMDb today to purify myself of this film by writing a review, because it was so disappointing to watch. The plot looked great when I read it, I was expecting a mysterious thriller minimal, a claustrophobic ghost hunt. Unfortunately, all this is so diluted by a mundane and tiring love story and by too many artificial and grumpy idiots "nobody says anything like that, except-in-the-bad-movies" that it's Here's a brief Overview of the worst crimes in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The scenario relies heavily on coincidences and on the unexplainable and inexcusable stupidity of the movie's main characters that it's just laughable. No, actually, it's annoying. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to that: thrills. A long parade "just in time". <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Okay, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced humans in real life, but that he acquired all his knowledge through bad movies. So, his characters are boring and lifeless clich√©s of the second generation. These are just simple intrigues, places without the slightest personality. They are "a man and a woman in rupture who still love each other". Never seen this one before except in 100,000 movies and it does not become more realistic or more enjoyable. Think about Hollywood's fainterest two-dimensional fare and you'll get it. There is not a single character in this film that is as fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - This resolution too sought and vague vague, which is very painful and only needs a boost to fall, although the word "resolution" could be poorly adapted here, because the movie is a boggy mess that is not going anywhere anyway. By the time you're done, though, you do not care anymore. The last third of the film I just went through, because it was so unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's all. Whatever the redeeming features of this film, all this is buried under the incompetence. Do not look at this shit.
