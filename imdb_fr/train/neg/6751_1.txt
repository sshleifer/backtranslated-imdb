My boyfriend and I rented this camera because we thought it might be a good start for Halloween. A killer terrorizing young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were wrong wrong! No pun. Not only did we discover one of the worst films on the market, but it was also a cult classic! It is filled with holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's about it. I want to emphasize that this film was shot with a VERY small budget - I always support movies like this one. Just not that one. <br /> <br /> This film can be good to see if you are intoxicated or high; otherwise do not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
