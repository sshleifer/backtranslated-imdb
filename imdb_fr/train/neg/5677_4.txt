"Seed" is a porn torture ... no doubt. But strangely, Uwe Boll has written, produced and directed a film more polished than any other film he has made in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Whenever I watch a Boll movie, I feel that some pages of the script must be gone. There are simply huge gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense either. The films are somewhat surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why do the six cops who are going to stop Seed separate and leave? their separate ways when they arrive at the darkened residence, unlike the real cops who would come in and clean the house in pairs or three? Why do not cops ever use their radios? How can bodies decompose so quickly, a process that would normally take several months? (I know it's fast-paced photography ... but Seed could never stay on time, which would kill people if he still waited for the previous victim to break down at the indicated point.) How is it? that Seed wears overalls and a mask while he is waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, walk around the cell block, and then leave without being arrested or even noticed? If nearly 80 people (according to some newspaper reports in the film) were murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to pick up Seed from Seed, where he had been arrested and where he had murdered his victims? (Did not he think about doing it sooner?) Why does the police detective do it alone, without backup and without even letting the post let him know what he was doing and where he was heading? <br /> <br /> This is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously tries to understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spent several minutes on the screen preparing this scene, while he could have spent other aspects of the film at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> In short, the film serves as a kind of frame for a few varied scenes (maybe Boll could think of these as his "visions") of a brutal death by bludgeoning, gunshots to the head, execution by electrocution and skinning live animals bred for their skin. (The opening scenes of dismembered animals were indeed useless and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly the clubbed death of a middle-aged woman by Seed at using a hatchet. It is obvious that a lot of time has been devoted to this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene of "Reservoir Dogs", but without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No, is it worth watching? Only if you are a hardcore fan of the porn torture genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a porn torture sample. As I said at the beginning of this review, even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be disgusting at times, it's really far more proficient than most Boll movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he progresses beyond pornographic torture and continues more in the vein of "Postal".
