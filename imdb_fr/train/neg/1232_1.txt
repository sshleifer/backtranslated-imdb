It is said that a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "film". No wonder she has no other credit to her name for writing or directing. She made a serious professional mistake in choosing this career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem of this film, apart from its ridiculous story of a woman who flees four weak thugs, is the flagrant and complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After leaving the mall, four thugs approach him while they surround him. Tell me, which woman would aggressively assault a potential attacker while being surrounded and verbally insult her? I do not want to say after an attack has already started, because then of course, it's quite normal for someone to react. But she pushed this guy and took him to the next level. No woman would do it unless you have 1) a weapon, 2) the confidence of knowing that the backup is very close and therefore relatively untouched, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak that they look sure enough she can take them. None of this applied in this situation, so she behaved as if someone were asking to be raped or assaulted. And, by the way, when the security guard approached Kim Basinger's handy grasp, why would not she immediately run to him for help or scream? <br /> <br /> ** When she leaves after the security guard is shot in the head, she goes to a deserted part of town and hangs. She had a good three-minute lead over the chasers, instead of just running diagonally behind the houses and climbing the barriers and continuing, she takes out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should have run. (I did not even want to say it was a chronological summary of the film, because I hate the people who do their criticism, but it turns out that every main sequence of this movie has something so obviously stupid that I have to comment on it). <br /> <br /> ** Why would she wear a red toolbox as she does hard You try to sneak in the dark? When she gets caught, one of the jokers asks her to open the toolbox. She resists first, then finally opens it. And take out a key. This scene here is so rich in subtle nuances of the complete failure of the dramatic effect that I have to break down, this is one of the most stupid scenes in the entire film. When asked to open the box, she resists first as if she intended to ask one of the thugs to open it up by anger after she did not open it in the same way as in an action movie have a device that an enemy asks that person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy seizes from this device, to have it automatically distribute a chemical / shoot him in the face / make him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all the way through. It seems like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger, as she opens the toolbox dramatically, quickly pulls out a key and sends one of the thugs, and somehow away from him and the other three thugs. <br /> <** In the rest of the movie, you will basically see this suburban housewife, sneaking into the woods carrying her red toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her attackers. <br /> ** When she ran away, how did she end up coming back to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where the radio played loudly in tribute to the dead guy. She sort of approached them when I thought she was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this premise is so weak because all the reason she is hunted down is that of thugs From her point of view, she witnessed a murder earlier on 'security agent. They therefore felt obliged to kill her. It's ridiculous! As one of the thugs even said, they could have left the city and come back to the city they came from, no one else had seen her anyway, and she probably did not got the license plate. Even if these possibilities are not favorable to them, how would creating a hell and hounding someone to kill him increase your chances of getting you from the original murder?
