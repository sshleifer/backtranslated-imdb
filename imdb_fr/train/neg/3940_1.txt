This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass for a movie by Modesty Blaise. If you have trouble sleeping, then rent this movie. The stick character they call an actress supposed to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on the planet. Maybe she could be used as a hat-rack in the back of a real movie. Seven-five minutes of nothing, thanks for having invented the button of fast forward. If you see this movie, if you can call it, it will happen to you. I can not help but think about what a third world country could use the money lost from this shit. this film is boring, the actors are boring, a loss of color, a breath of air they breathe. If you want to see Mostey Blaise Film, look at the one they made in the '60s and maybe the director should do.
