It was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. In wood, it gives the impression that a rocking horse could do a better job. But then remember this turning point in Four Weddings, just as unbearable. Another film that describes England as full of boxes of chocolates and village greens. I mean this school, how many schools other than maybe Hogwarts look like that? The police station resembled the decor of Heartbeat (a nauseating British series set in the 1960s). This film just could not get an idea of ​​what it wanted to be: a comedy or a serious examination of the foundations of friendship between women. If it had stuck to the old one, then the sex scenes in the cemetery and the extremely stupid assault on the wedding might have worked (I'm just saying). But these scenes just did not work with the tragedy of the second half. I also find it incredible that Kate is talking to Molly again after her horrible behavior. One last note: what does a decent actress like Staunton do in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the anti-wrinkle cream advertising.
