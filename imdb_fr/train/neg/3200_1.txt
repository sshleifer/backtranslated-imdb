Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a grimy and sweaty murderer quagmire in a stupid cowboy costume Roy Rogers could have made fun of. Somehow, he still has a badge, probably because he lives in Texas and they will let NOTH apply to the law. <br /> <br /> This greasy loser is a deputy sheriff near the border with Texas. Not surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger, but he was fired as he seemed to think the law was his own personal bouncy ball to play at his discretion. This includes shooting at suspects across the international border in Mexico, hitting suspects, cheating in shootings, threatening women, initiating shootings that could have been avoided AND to endanger the life of a child, promised that he would help and protect himself from being killed just so he could get out of prison, etc. This guy makes LA cops look like saints. <br /> <br /> When his partner is killed by a pair of wandering Italian Assassins, Joe Don's character sues them and kills one. Then he takes the other to Italy at the request of Mr. Wilson, who rightly thinks that Joe Don will ruin everything. In record time, he lost the Italian and blew up a Maltese taxi driver. This is only the first of many deaths and major destruction that Joe Don leaves behind as he unleashes himself through Malta in search of Palermo (the Italian assassin). <br /> <br /> The Mobius band starts the film, in which our hero is arrested, presented by the Maltese police chief, goes out and causes more problems, is arrested, is presented by the head of the police ... and so on. Until you want to blow your head with Joe Don's ivory-handled pistol and end the horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves his uselessness not only during the first escape of Palermo, but also during the subsequent pursuit by boat from which he falls in a single punch. He is then taken by Palermo after threatening a woman with a hanger. You hope that Palermo will end up torturing him in the basement cell in which he was put, but none of the strippers he threatened came to bring him out, because he had promised to protect her. His throat cuts quickly (big surprise) and Joe Don escapes in the night. <br /> <br /> And here, you hope he may have been drowned in the (still another) pursuit by boat. But even the ocean does not want it and spits it on a shore where it is cared for by a poor Maltese family (what have they ever done to deserve this?), It returns to town, where it is arrested by the police, made a conference by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The police officer escorting him released him so that they could go to Palermo. Why she would do anything to destroy the heart of his career, this big slob exceeds me. It's an annoying puzzle. <br /> <br /> They go to the villa where Palermo is hiding and launch a shooting. Joe Don cheats happily and kills Palermo. He then gives the last and dazzling last line of the film: "The big one has my badge, can you go and get it for me?" Thank you for that immortal line, Mr. Baker. It will remain in the annals of the film's story as the last most literate, most astonishing and most wonderful line ever uttered by a character in a film. It certainly corresponds to all the rest of the character. Bravo.
