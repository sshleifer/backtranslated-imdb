"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It's a beloved film of mothers, grandmothers and incarcerated people who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, it's blowing. There is no awkward corpse in sight, and it is terribly clear in the department of gores. "Zombie 3", meanwhile, is very strong and very generous with his bloodshed. So it's better than "Gone With the Wind". Nor is it overestimated. Most reviewers do not have an illusion that it is garbage. However, they are not boring garbage. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being chased by a helicopter and the chemicals seep into the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty preparation, hides in a hotel room where he slowly turns into a flesh-eating zombie. One of her first victims is a housekeeper. Once she is bitten, Lucio Fulci's hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci film, the acting is atrocious, the story is full of holes in the plot, and the gore is plentiful. It turns out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is poorly shot too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Yet he is saved by his joyous adherence to the deadliest and his impatient pace. It's really worth being picked up if you are a complete undead. Or do not like "Gone With The Wind", arguably the worst zombie movie of all time.
