A country singer nicknamed "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks her fledgling musical career and her life by falling into the company of a shady drunkard (Busey) who wants to be his manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. Meanwhile, there is music in abundance, as Parton, with his fluent vocal talent, sings song after song (at least half a dozen of them pertaining to Texas). Stay away from this mess and look into NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
