It is true that some fans of the work of Peter Sellers may be disappointed by the latter company. But all fans of Sellers will certainly be delighted with all his films, simply thanks to the enormous talent of this man. and the fiendish plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, it would be Sellers' latest film (even after his death), but it's always nice to see how the man managed to retain his irreplaceable talent until his untimely demise. And not only do we get a salesman, but we get there, because Sellers not only plays the leading role, but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective looking for the crazy Fou, 168 years old. The story is just as odd as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to craft her anti-aging elixir, as well as Nayland and her group of associates who try to prevent it. Like all major Sellers films, the film is guaranteed with impeccable performance, as well as many of its familiar co-stars: David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren, to name a few. It's also nice to see Burt Kwouk (Cato), the pillar of the Pink Panther, make a camouflage appearance with Sellers - even if he plays the same role, but still nice. The story is indeed pretty ridiculous, as are most characters involved, which classifies it as a film heavily influenced by Goon. And while she never reaches the top of Goon comedy, many funny jokes seem to be going in the right direction. The film failed commercially during its initial release due to the worldwide mourning after Sellers' death (the movie was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is still that painful thought that was hiding deep in your mind when you watched it last film. It's far from a good movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes are simply missing - but it's still nice - if only for another outstanding performance by Peter Sellers .
