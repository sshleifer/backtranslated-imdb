I went to see "Evening" because of the cast. I had gone to see "Norman's Room" for this reason - this film featuring Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and, also, Meryl Streep - and I loved every minute. Same for "The Notebook", even if it was light. And my feeling was that anything that could be interpreted by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I sometimes found that even the biggest actors could not overcome a banal, simplistic and, on one occasion, really shocking content. <br /> <br /> The structure of the film did not cause me any problem. In fact, I appreciate the movies that come and go in time to tell a story ... as long as one time illuminates the other and the verse. But while Vanessa's character lying on her deathbed and remembering a past event, she thought "it was a mistake" was fascinating, sometimes the part actually showing what this "mistake of the past" was doing nothing to clarify the issue. In fact, it seems insignificant in the most idiotic mode "girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loser boy", and in the most incredible, clichéd and misguided way possible. <br /> <br /> be careful, keep this in mind if you keep reading. <br /> <br /> First, Claire Danes was brutally mowed. Not only does she not even start to look like Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, but she has nowhere near chops when it comes to acting. Do not get me wrong, she can be good in the right role - but not this one. And Patrick Wilson was a bad idea, although he has the skills to do it. He would have done better to play the role of Hugh Dancy - the rich confused WASP - and not sexual attraction to anyone; he's a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? A note - "I am a drunk tortured and wait to know why." And the "why" (I am a locker in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink excessively and ridicule myself in front of everyone I know) offended me so much and his way of dying (as you knew that he would do it because it's the only thing that can happen to a fagot in the 50s) so ridiculous, badly taken and mismanaged, I almost throw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life", her sister wondering if she did the good choices, her pregnancy and her too perfect boyfriend (which could have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson and Ebon Moss-Bachrach could have been a more interesting Harris, given her dreamy eyes) - anyway, any it was blurred in the 70s and 80s. And more in depth. Do we REALLY have to present it again, as if it were fresh and important? <br /> <br /> And to top it off, Meryl Streep will not appear until the last ten minutes of the film, while old lady makeup who hides a lot of her facial expressions. She's always good, but it's only because she's Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to engage in the silliest dialogue under the heavier makeup. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, this movie has all the clichés of the movie book "really meaningful message", and it adds a few that really have nothing to complain about, again. After two hours and a music "Lifetime Movie-of-the-week" that will guarantee you to rub in the brutal state, it is a total failure for both the aspects "significant" and "for the cinema ". I give him "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all you expect from your movies is twadd on, then please, put aside my comments on "Evening" and leave your life time. But if you want to have a truly enriching experience and be served by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story of life and death and all that flows from it, rent "Norman's Room" and find out what is really great to play.
