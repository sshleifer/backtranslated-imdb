Spooks is a nice basket, with well-directed sequences, ridiculous intrigues and dialogues, and third-rate actors. <br /> <br /> Many have described this version as an English version of "24", and we can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the weak and ridiculous intrigues, but the execution is so much more sleazy, sexier and, I suspect, more expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people call the weak comedy "sweet comedy". . <br /> <br /> It's a sweet spy hour, as opposed to everything John Le Carre has created. <br /> <br /> Give me a smile every day.
