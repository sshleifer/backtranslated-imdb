I'm lucky! I had a glimpse of this little pathetic horror film from Artisan Entertainment in Texas a week before it came out on a video shelf and let me tell you ... I've rarely laughed so much in my life to watch This atrocious megabomb will be back on track and win the title of "worst killer clown movie ever" on the Full Moon fiasco, insensibly stupid and stupid (I'm sure many of us, fans of horror, have suffered from this!) was shot in DV, and the quality of digital is not really good, but it fails miserably in all areas where it matters! <br /> <br /> The story (light and a clich√© as is) goes as follows ... A leader (Ken Hebert, who also scripted and co-produced with the director) takes the skeptical colleague Tracy (Amanda Watson) and the exciting married couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) on a weekend getaway in an isolated (yawn) hut 12 miles from the nearest town. On the way, they take a bitch-hussy (Melissa Bale) in a bar and meet at their destination, where a night camp fire tale featuring a murderous clown harassing the same wooded area becomes a reality when everyone desecrated yakin, friends of pot-smokin disappear one by one, only mutilated dolls are left to tell their fate. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the film until close to the end and it does not look like the demonic representation of the video box (aside from being morbidly obese ). He spent an hour in the woods, cutting wood and holding nursery rhymes. I can not say enough about the cast, especially about the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who deliver their tasteless dialogue with a minimum of enthusiasm or who act in the most inappropriate way. It does not really help that the screenplay is totally and completely devoid of suspense, originality, intelligence, overall coherence or humor. I could tell for days how inept this film is, how many errors of continuity and how much all the production is amateurish, but I'll stop here pointing out that the whole package is a Real riot in this boy-this- sucks kind of way. <br /> <br /> Noting also that the film was released in the US as SICK (SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER). It is currently cataloged under its original title GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
