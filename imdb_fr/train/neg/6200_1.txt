It's the most disturbing film I've ever seen. It makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although, technically, it is reasonably well done, acting, cinematography, music, staging, etc. are good. However, the final scene of gang rape is the most dreadful and violent thing I have ever seen and I really wish I had not seen it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think everyone finds the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way and I did not really need an explicit reminder of the horror experienced. I saw the movie at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX and none of the actors or team was present. I wish they had the opportunity to defend the violence of their film, which I considered excessive, gratuitous and useless. A previous scene managed to convey the atmosphere they apparently aspired to, but without rubbing your face in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a large warning label. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
