When a friend gave me a box of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was naturally a little cautious. But as this object was a gift, I really did not pay much attention to common sense. After all .... movies for free! So what if they are a little ropey After much thought, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because he seemed to be the best of the group. All I can say is that, if it's the best of them, I shudder to think of the rest. <br /> <br /> In appearance, there were good things to do. Four (count!) Actors I knew. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I thought ... "Billy and Tracy have been in a good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) for not signing up for a turkey." Max is a veteran soap opera actor who has never really been successful to break into the movie .... but not a shoddy actor An Jeff ... well ... he did good and bad about movies and TV. "I was soon to discover that Jeff had decided to add "the villain" to his repertoire of films. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff makes his way through a scene "I'm crazy" before killing himself. A fun cameo performance, really. Unfortunately, it is, without exaggerating too much, the highlight of the film. The descent begins from there. <br /> <br /> Then we have the Mission Commander (Williams) who is sent to see what happened to Jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from the ranks of the element criminal. But this assortment does not really look like Dirty Dozen, but rather an unconvincing quartet. In addition, one of the criminals, a hacker, is shown in his cell working on a laptop. Is not it a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the Slammer neighborhood? Pretty lame prison, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they are finally removed, the effects are really horrible. It seems that the model of the spaceship was overthrown in the afternoon by a bored 8-year-old boy who had pieces of his Airfix kits left. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. En route to the area where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by receiving virtual reality weekends, in which they indulge in their male fantasies. All is well, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the "alien threat" that begins to appear there. But were they forced to drag him during a sooooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally, they reach G-Sector and the extraterrestrial presence forces them to fight each other for his affections until all that remains is the good old Max. The end, in a vein of waste film really optimistic, suggests a sequel - as if! A character that I will nickname "Sweatdroid" is also appearing in this movie. He is supposed to be an android, but apparently, the make-up team, which has provided him with sweaty strokes at all times, has forgotten this fact. But do not worry, he's just here to invent the body figures at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be honest, do very little in the film. They are barely awake, let alone act. And, as I said earlier, Jeff goes in the shower early, so his manicure does not light up the movie. Max does his best, like some other cast members, but the movie is really horribly awful, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The one and only halfway feature of fantasy that this film offers is the naming convention for ships. They all bear the names of musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is bland and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought that during the initial viewing, it was one of those 80 films made directly on video. Looks like they've always made good shit movies in the 90s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It's better to avoid it. Even as a movie beer n chips, this movie is a fucking secret, but at least you can pass it on quickly, I guess.
