This version is pretty bland, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre has been one of my favorite books since childhood, but William Hurt's exhausted and disposable playing style is totally inappropriate to Edward Rochester's daring passion, and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored and petulant teenager whose dental orthoses hurt! I can not believe either that they eliminated the big scene from Edward's marriage proposal at the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in the literature. I appreciate that they have finally used such a young and ordinary woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be 18, but if you want to see a version closer to the novel's personality and passions, please see Version 70's with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and handsome to play Jane, but no one touched the Rochester character in the same way as Scott did.
