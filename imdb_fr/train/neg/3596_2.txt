To be as honest as possible, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or ????) is a total trouble. The film has a good premise behind it ?? the resurrection of a long-dead vampire through the body of a descendant with the help of a group of women dressed in black ?? but the execution is horrible. There are very long moments of time on the screen where literally nothing happens. The characters are left doing nothing. There is no mystery, no suspense, and no intrigue to take into account. The acting is simply abominable. Most actors use a group of under average women looking for nude dancers looking at the camera. They do it several times. And what a little plot there seems to have been designed to get more of these less attractive women naked so that they can join the dance. Although it's not as bad or useless as dancing or intrigue in something like Orgy of the Dead, it's close to it.
