From time to time, a new entry of foreign films is served. It's their big attraction. They come alive and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many blockages and a morbid fear of financial failure. The almighty dollar determines their selections. Something that invites European directors. In addition, viewers around the world remain hungry for "different" movies, especially those that offer a tasty bite to the miserable and suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors and producers, many audiences aspire to the beauty, poetry and immaculate flavor of life. This is what the movie "To the Father's Left" offers to a curious audience. A family that firmly believes that the unity of the family stems from the unity of its obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets that his members are human beings in flesh and blood, filled with wild dreams, unleashed and obscure passions, they are both moving. Selton Mello incarnates Andr√© as a son who seeks to master his passions thanks to the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman trying to quench a thirst for family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers a lot, but takes a lot of time to say it. ***
