The name "cult movie" is often attributed to movies that continue to be screened or sold in home movie format, more than a generation after their first release. Superchick, which was released in 1973, now falls into this category. His sectarian status is largely due to the continuing interest of women who see him as an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young woman working as a flight attendant - a career option that, in her the 1970s, was generally considered one of the most prestigious girls, and also allows him to imitate the traditional sailor who would have a wife in each port. As she holds the Black Belt Karate status, she is able to make it clear that she is very happy with her single life and that she is in no way beholden to one of her many male admirers. This film is a sitcom that avoids the usually much shorter appeal of outright pranks. Her attraction to feminists is also reinforced by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate skills to avoid a diversion and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant destiny. To ensure that this film will appeal to men and their partners, the director has ensured that it is widely sprinkled with treats for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be appreciated by those who are not too critical and who want a comedy very light and easy to watch, they will soon forget after watching. It's so forgettable that they'll probably find it just as nice if they watch it again in a year; despite his age, he could keep his cult status for a while. However, the dialogue and the game would make it difficult to give this film a score higher than 4/10.
