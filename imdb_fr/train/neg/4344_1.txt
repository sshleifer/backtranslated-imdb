If you hit your head with a shovel, write the scenario with your feet, you may approach the level of intelligence of this film. There is nothing in this film that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster movies and that has been done much better. Those who think that "Scarface" was a kind of hero to watch or see "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought that MMM "It's life for me!" will like this movie. I thought I'd give the film a chance because the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after watching Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs get involved. Anyone over a 4th year, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
