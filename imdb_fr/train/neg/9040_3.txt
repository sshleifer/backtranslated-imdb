I agree that even though Melville's story may not be infiltrable, it's not even a credible essay. Moving history in the twentieth century only scandalizes the spirit and nature of the original story; you may have been able to transfer it to England, but it must be a period piece. Even our narrator of history - the owner - tells us in a flashback, going back even further, around 1800. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, a strangely disobedient worker would be rejected without thinking about it. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a deleted break expl√©tive !!! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work very well, considering the end. And the film ends? I do not know what it was, because I did not watch all the parody - I had to stop. It was like putting "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
