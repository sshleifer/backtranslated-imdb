Well, I guess I should be the one who says, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this show rated for PBS last night, I was full of hope and apprehension. I loved "Morse" (I even went so far as to buy the full DVD) and I felt that although I still liked Kevin Whately's Sgt. Lewis's character, the show was John Thaw, period! After watching the new "Inspector Lewis" (as it says here), I am more convinced than ever of my reason ... Whately is beautiful (although he looks horrible (both badly aged and too much big), but Thaw does not have the charisma to carry the series. <br /> <br /> And as for his "companion" Fox, well ... maybe the critics of England can understand this he said, but I usually could not. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is James Grout who misses me. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have to say they should have done it.Leg "Morse" stays in peace.
