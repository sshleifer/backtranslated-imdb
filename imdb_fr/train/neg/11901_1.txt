"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of the German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many felt it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now, "Land of Plenty" makes it all clear; not only did Wenders lose it, but he actually became a bad director, creating horribly faint and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> One could argue that the "time you lose" concerns all filmmakers, but Wenders The case is extreme. It's as if he had completely forgotten everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - to achieve neglected results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this film does not deserve your time.
