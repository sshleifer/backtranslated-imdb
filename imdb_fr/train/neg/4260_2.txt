Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the movie to start. It was horribly boring and consisted mainly of people walking randomly in the hills with no apparent direction. Then, the hero enters the scene. Born as an Asian, he became white when he grew up. Obviously white. He was not even about to pass for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely entertaining and the story did nothing to help the cause. Useless battle sequences and lame dialogue. It's been an hour and forty five minutes, and in the end, I was trying to eat my own face. I watched this because the people in the video store where I work always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It looks like that: ahem. "NO, GOOD GOD NO, IT'S HORRIBLE, DO NOT DO IT YOURSELF!" I would recommend another movie, maybe an entertaining film. "
