I watched the other comments and was amused to see that only the people who actually worked on the film had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, mitigate it a bit. "Revolutionary" is a little excessive. It's a Boston-based university production that does not even reach the level of most amateur college films. That's what you expect from a group of children. A stupid action movie without a lot of creativity. It's pretty funny if you're ready to make fun of it. Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at Emerson College.
