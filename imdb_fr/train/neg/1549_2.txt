While Leon is cute on SNL, he only stays on for a minute. Like most sketches in SNL movies, this one can not last 90 minutes. There are some cute moments (the ones you saw in the trailer) but the actors are largely lost. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have many strengths. Will Farrell has a bit of a role. Farrell is perhaps the most funny man ... but not in this movie. Too bad.
