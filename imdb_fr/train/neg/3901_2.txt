The script is nice. Although the casting is absolutely unassailable. No style. the costumes do not look like those of High Highbury. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow, although in the role of Mrs. Paltrow lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and does not look at all keen and does not feel insensitive like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S. The viewer does not see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. Developing the Smith relationship as it appeared in the animated version, we can not understand where Emma was trying to make an Elton-Smith match (in addition to the portrait).
