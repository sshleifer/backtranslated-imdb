No one is more fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman papers than me. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see earlier that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, because I also see that he realized the Three / Four Musketeers. with Fraser, but I did quite well. <br /> <br /> Not so royal. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie came out and I could not have been more enthusiastic since He had read all the Flashman articles up to that point and was in a state of readiness. drunk with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still am, but he never really had the opportunity to do it afterwards). <br /> What a disappointment! (I saw him again when I was about 20 years old on TV and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogues of the books are transferred to the screen. The comedy of the Flashman character seemed to me to have been mismanaged in the same way that one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it. The duel and the fencing were terrible and not very dramatic. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the film failed to exploit the direct satire possibilities of previous versions of Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <If you have read the book and you have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg who quickly become friends and play a game that Rudi comes to invent: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything about books. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie more recently, but I'm glad I did not see it. <br /> <br /> If, by chance, Fraser reads this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest humorous novelist of his generation, but, based on my Appreciation of this corpus, it is also difficult to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as he did all those terrible films of Roger Moore James Bond.
