I comment on this miniseries from the point of view of someone who read the novel first. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that even though it's nice, I can understand why it has not been broadcast at any time recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It is terribly badly received. The actors who played the younger generation were all between 15 and 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 years old at the time) was playing Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be around 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 years old at the time) was playing Byron Henry who was supposed to be around 22 years old. The other children, Henry and Pamela Tudsbury, were also played by actors far too old for characters supposed to be in their twenties. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the actors were absolutely awful. Ali McGraw has sometimes almost made this mini-card unassailable. I saw more convincing performances in high school plays. <br /> <br /> 3) The staging was mediocre. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad acting and character development was probably the staging. Hitler's representation was well exaggerated. His character eventually resembled and behaved more like a cartoon villain than by the charismatic genius, sometimes charming, but always diabolical, that painted him Herman Wouk, as in the novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) that they do not gain the depth of character that Wouk has created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. Hokey music, pretentious narration (it sounded like a story film story for junior high school) and the whole sensation of a TV drama in the prime time of the mini sometimes made her almost comical. In addition, too often, Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like those of 1979 rather than 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who looks at this without having the benefit of reading the novel first does will probably not miss this, because it will be more like a primetime TV soap opera in the late 70's or early 80's, instead of the TV version of what is definitely a classic modern american. <br /> <br /> Remakes of old movies and other similar movies are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably a case in which a creative and inspired director could achieve a very astonishing, memorable and acclaimed production by criticism. I never see that happen because a remake should be as long (15 hours) or longer to get it right, and given the short attention span of most current US viewers, it would not fly.
