There is no point trying to glorify part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a wastebasket. At the very beginning, you might think that you are about to fall into a cinematic movie ... and soon after, you're hit by a big bag (burlap) from FAIL! The fighting is barely martial, the acting is at the limit, and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough history to create an excuse for making this movie. The decisions made by the characters and the way they handle the situations are weak and have only frustrated me. I think the only reason this film came into being is to act as a support service using Yumiko Shaku.
