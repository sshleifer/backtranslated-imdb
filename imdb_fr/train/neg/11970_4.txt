... for the lieutenant to choose this one. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. In the worst case, the following scenario: if Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but she was absolutely determined that his "people" would succeed in leaving the missionary, he would have put on the first helicopter and led these refugees at the border without it. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. That's not how it works. But, as I said, it's Hollywood, it takes drama. That's why we make movies, because the reality is not so complicated. However, I thought Willis and the good doctor had a viable chemistry. That said, there are also battle scenes well done in the film. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
