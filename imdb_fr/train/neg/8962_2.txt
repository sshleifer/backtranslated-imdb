I think this one is rubbish on the ice because he left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who is and why. The original CUBE has never left the cube and leaves everything to your imagination. This shitty party, however, gives you everything. and I did not like that ... Although the cast is solid, I think the reason it was disappointing was because it was done by people other than ORIGINAL filmmakers, if they asked to Vincenzo Natali to do it, or even following I think he would have done better and would have been more faithful to the source. So I recommend you to stay away, far away from this one, and HYPERCUBE, another movie I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave him a 2 for the role only)
