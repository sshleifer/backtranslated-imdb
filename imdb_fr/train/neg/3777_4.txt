Flat, soulless computer images on less amazing backgrounds animate a horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even know when the songs of Bryan Adams will arrive, which are always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, is bored voice when he tells what's going on. Narration is not necessary because everything that happens is really obvious. You can even know what the horses say, even if they just neigh. Which would be good, but all horses emit exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for grief, one for laughter, etc. There is no variation between the voices of the horses. <br /> <br /> Young children might like this movie, though. It is not enough for a family to sit and watch, and there is little chance of anyone being scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your kids, it's not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is not recommended.
