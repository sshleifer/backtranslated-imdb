I was very unhappy about this move. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was not humorous, the action exaggerated, the songs little melodious. Even the scenario was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Kareena cradled the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think that Hindi stunt directors should look for how action movies are made. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because it's their centerpiece. But the signature of Hindi cinema are the songs. A good action movie should not last more than two hours and can not seem unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these action movies will become much sharper. Also note: action movies and action movies only mix if they are done correctly. Good luck next time.
