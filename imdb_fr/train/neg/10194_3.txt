This 30-minute documentary made by Bu単uel in the early 1930s on one of the poorest areas of Spain is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First of all, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was at the time (and when I say that, I quite agree that wealth can be a source of problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although overall, wealth is far better than the extreme poverty described here). And if poverty has receded in Spain, it is not exactly with the type of socialism that Bu単uel preferred, but with Western-style European capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is this: in one scene, the narrator reprimands that at school, children learn the value of Pi. Teaching mathematics to the poor, the horror! Bu単uel's lack of foresight is the most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to knowledge and advanced technologies that will help the poor overcome their situation. What does he propose? That children learn exactly what in school? Bu単uel does not understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor compared to others?
