(spoilers) The truly memorable part of this rather dull and tepid piece of British cuisine is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dye jobs ever made. That, and the beautiful caterpillar smiled at the evil old man who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making funny a boring and boring gray movie. I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his "death touch," and when he brings it back to the theater, Mike cries, "Guys, I'm dead, I've seen eternal truth and beauty! this film ... "It would be disappointing to have to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man. The film could make a fortune by being sold as a sleep aid. Some of the movie's word games were mean: police inspector - "electrocution!" Crow - "Shocking, is not it?" Police Inspector - "It's okay, all right" Tom Servo- "Very low, just down!" Police Inspector- "Can I continue?" Tom Servo- "He's dead, but knock yourself out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
