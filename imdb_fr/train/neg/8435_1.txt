Movie very disappointing. In the end, I was not busy with any of the characters. I really liked seeing Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was good as always, still not worth watching. It starts strong and continues to weaken. Insomniacs will like that, because I'm sure it will make them sleepy.
