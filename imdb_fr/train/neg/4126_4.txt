Absolutely nothing happens in this tiny thriller, annoying and emotionless led by the usual contributor Amenabar, Mateo Gil. The film, which deals in some way with the effect of boredom and the search for thrills, offers none, and looks like an exercise in boredom. The highlight of the film, which takes about 30 seconds of these 100 agonizing minutes, is the only moment that arouses a little suspense and is solved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the unfolding of the story is arbitrary and any device or intrigue plot is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show initiative or resourcefulness. If you're a fan of the genre, look for "Tesis" instead.
