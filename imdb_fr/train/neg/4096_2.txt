It was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she would not live in a commune with him (it was crazy to see that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). At that time and there, I had problems with the series - go, I say to myself, is it the same noble Michael Stivic who contradicted Archie Bunker's right-wing philosophies? The series continued, but there was simply no pizazz. Whatever the momentum Sally Struthers gained from the whole family, he had long since disappeared. Maybe if the show had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked. Oh, it's show business.
