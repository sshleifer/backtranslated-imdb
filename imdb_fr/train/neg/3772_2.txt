I just saw Dick Tracy and I found it terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities were awful. In addition, the characters in the crowd looked too weird. Warren Beatty did not do a terrible job as Dick Tracy but it was certainly not one of his best performances. Madonna should just stick to singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the incredible actor Al Pacino. It was not a good note of his career, but he still did a good job.
