This film is a bad memory of my childhood. It's one of those movies they show kids on a rainy day at school when they can not go out on a break and you want to watch anything, anything else. At least that's what it was when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Certainly, I have not seen it for about fifteen years and they probably do not use it anymore on rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: you'd better use this to put your children to sleep than to entertain them. Believe me, choose something else. Even though the subject is quite controversial, the plot is so sweet and slow that I do not remember it except that I loved it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against this. .
