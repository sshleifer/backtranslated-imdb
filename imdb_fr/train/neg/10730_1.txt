The film begins with 3 people meeting in the bar. OKAY. They talk about their imaginary life, they lie all the time, for no reason. Always ok. From time to time, they even make you laugh. Interesting. The first 30 minutes make you enjoy! But then ... things get worse ... nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see are old, naked "ladies" touching each other! Disagree. Repugnant! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but that's it! The film does not make sense, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (film festival), this film was the most popular according to research, of course, before people look at it! I even thought (before watching): "Hay, it could be interesting, although it is a Russian film"! But, my God, no !!!!
