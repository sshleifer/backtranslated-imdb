Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai," or "Big Trouble in Little China," or "Conan the Barbarian," which are horrendous movies that have a certain coolness and humor that turns them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is just bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not impracticable, and there are fun times. But here, Eddy Murphy's "turnaround attitude" only deflates any sense of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to this tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are blunted rather than solicited. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake or that the characters are facing a real danger, why should we care? Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - The big fans of Eddy Murphy who can not help <br /> <br /> - I do not arrive not to think of anyone else <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
