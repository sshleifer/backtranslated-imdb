I do not know what it was about this movie that made me react so viscerally against him. Maybe it's the characters who are so unfriendly and have not been convincing enough. Maybe it was the disorganized scenario. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe was wearing a long earring and an eyeliner. Maybe it was due to the fact that at one point in the film, they all started to sing. It may be because the 1980s have never been so old. Maybe it was because everything was a blistering hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character was raising his fist away from the camera during a fade. I do not know what made me hate it, but if it means trying to watch it again, I'm not willing to know it.
