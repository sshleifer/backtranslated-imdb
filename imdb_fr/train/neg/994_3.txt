This film was nil and net. Okay, so it's basically a girl who gets raped. In revenge, she chooses another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a shower, but the victim girl is partly to blame. I mean, they both get in the mood and start kissing, but when the rapist tries to make love to her, she does not allow it and the rapist rapes her. And the thing is, the rape scene for the girl is very short and she does not expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist being raped, it's a fairly long scene of rape. In the story, nothing is worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
