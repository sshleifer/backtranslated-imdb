I ordered this extremely rare and overestimated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. Fan of eternal horror, from American 80s slashers to European zombie movies, I thought it would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be more gorier than it is. After all, I had heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to watch it. The murders are boring. The acting game ... forget it, there is no game! The story, even if you do not care, is incredibly bad. It seems that they have tried to catch your attention with strange sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case, it does not help the film. Why? There is no atmosphere and it's the worst thing about this movie. It's just bad to turn from point A to point B. Although it's extremely funny and fun to watch with your friends and a lot of beer, make no effort to get your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro Files!
