but Thomas Ian Griffith just does not have the polish of a big budget actor, knowing that it was done more than 5 years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been programmed to make this not just action, but comedy. And how do you get Katia Koslovska KC anyway? The character of Plummer was so corny that he could have been better suited to a Bullwinkle. Personally, if the action movies will show skin - I would have liked to see the same time between woman and man, otherwise shows nothing.
