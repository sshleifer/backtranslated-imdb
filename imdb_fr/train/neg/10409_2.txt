As if the screenplay was not depressing enough, this film shows that cows are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse for five minutes, while the protagonist recounts his butcher's debut. Weird stuff. Then there is the basic principle of the hero / heroine who will cut his dick because a 10 year old man at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psychopath, a masochist, just a condemned queen who goes too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? Only he was not adopted and had to live with nuns who loved him first and then hated him because he was undisciplined. He tries to explain to us why he did what he did, but it's really hard to understand. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it really about?
