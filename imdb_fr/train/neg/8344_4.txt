After reading all the rave reviews on this movie and some that give it an average appearance. I finally decided to put my value on it. I agree with most people that if it had not been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed at Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled to the south 77 years ago, at least as long as a gas tank would allow. I had a little laugh about the critics who subtly claim that they cerebralize a little better than most by claiming that they followed the plot without allowing any confusion. This tale of the Crook brothers is like an old record with a jump. As an American, I understand the difficulties faced by Indian filmmakers. A trip to Romania would certainly have destroyed the budget. Let's see the whole movie: a loop loop of Claire at the gas station, Claire by the roadside, Claire under the bleachers, Claire at home, Claire at the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It was becoming almost monotonous and would be so if she had not been the best player in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living but do not write a two-page script and turn it into one hour, twenty movies. Before writing another dream ghost scenario, watch one or two episodes of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a background. All actors except those mentioned above and a few others were engaged in their first and last film. In addition, co-director Jeff played in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, huh? One of the aims of the film was that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis' backside. Well, with all the sarcasm now satisfied, I always recommend the movie for the horror lover just to see this young actress in training (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worthy of being looked.
