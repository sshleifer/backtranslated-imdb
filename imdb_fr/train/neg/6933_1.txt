Compared to other Columbo films, this can only be described as 1 (awful). I really do not understand what other critics have seen in this dreadful train accident of a movie. It was only through morbid fascination that I continued to look at him - to see what a bizarre or foolish decision the director was going to make. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that this was the only film made by Falk as it hindered his role role. In fact, I think the real reason lies in the studio heads, who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. It's a miracle they did not murder him.
