The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman, the "Dreamer" in Envy, finds its richness and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize" which, sprayed on dog poop, removes the poop. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product, so I could spray it on this "stinking film" of a movie and make it disappear in the air too. <br /> <br /> Even though Envy is not the worst film I've seen in the last 12 months (this honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it's only the honor of 'a second. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, not anything. A real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
