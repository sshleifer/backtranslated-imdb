Johnny Rivers' closing song was the only big thing about this movie. Unfortunately, all I can say about this Western film is positive. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be published, but there are more than 8 lines of bad sense in this western. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a parody. The hero and villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. Many of the actors in this film looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator found the film fantastic and commented in the comments President Bush. It was not a democratic western or republican. It was just a bad western movie sold commercially. I wonder if it brought in money. Sometimes I thought about watching a film made by film students. If it was, then it was an excellent movie.
