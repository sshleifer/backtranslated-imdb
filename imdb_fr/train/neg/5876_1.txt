I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately, I chose this version. Whether the actor (actors transmit most of their replicas directly to the camera) or the shots (medium or close ... no scenes of landscapes and very few backgrounds), they were absolutely terrible. I watched this during my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I have been gypted by 114 minutes of vacation. Not recommended by any effort of imagination.
