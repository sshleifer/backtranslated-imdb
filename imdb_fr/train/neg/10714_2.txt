For two of the funniest comics, the movie was awful. Fast forward and never had better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so good in comedy. The glimpses were really great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a girls movie, it was bad. What's going on with that? The movie was very slow and boring. I will not recommend it to anyone yet. I would like my money for this one! BOO us here in Arizona. Thank you but, no thank you. Who does this stupid stuff to make people think you're pregnant? I thought it was going to be so funny. I had my own children and helped other people get some. It could have been more in line with reality.
