I had many problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is good. Although Quantum Physics has been around for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a grand way that seems to say, "Are not you blown away!" Well not really. They are no longer shocking revelations. In any case, I already knew quantum theory, and the fact that particles must be described using wave equations, etc. is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this film, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a means of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I do not have any serious problems with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics really does not have anything to do with these things, and you have to separate them. The people they interviewed for this film start from the ideas of quantum theory and then make the jump by saying that by simply thinking about something, we can change the subject around us, that's why we should think positively to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not follow logically from quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" they interviewed for this film, there are dozens of physicists theoretically who would disagree completely. They would rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world did not support mystical notions about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people go to see this movie and eat it completely. because it leaves them a good positive feeling. The film is essentially based on a misinterpretation of quantum theory. His reasoning is as bad as any attempt to justify an organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" said that since most assumptions about the world have turned out to be wrong, the assumptions we currently have about the world are also likely to be wrong. Huh? It does not follow completely. And even if it were, I do not see how that could help his argument. I mean, if his ideas have become common assumptions, then I guess we should assume they are also false, based on his own reasoning.
