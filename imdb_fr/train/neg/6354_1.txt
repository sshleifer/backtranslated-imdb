Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. This is the case of "Melinda and Melinda", where all the characters talk about Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that can not be told to anyone outside a radius of four. streets of Allen's home. They also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi-million dollar apartments in Manhattan, which seem to have been designed by professional decorators, regardless of their financial situation or professional life. <br /> <br /> The character that exists outside of this dull mindset is Will Ferrel as a mandatory substitute for Woody Allen. Although he does not just make an impression of Woody Allen (as Kenneth Branagh in the terrible "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he himself played the role in his best movies. . <br /> <br /> The end result is yet another example of a series of self-indulgent boredom by a once-famous filmmaker, who has been trading his old reputation for years.
