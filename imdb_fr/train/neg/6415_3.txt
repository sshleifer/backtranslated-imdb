It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar lived up to her old book of expression game, empty of fear and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else on the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who think the grudge is "quite acceptable", do not go see it unless you enjoy wasting time and your life. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for free, so I do not want it to look like a diabolical guy who lost $ 8 on a terrible movie. It was free, it was still no one, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
