What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pace was bad, the cinematography was bad, the staging was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect some degree of wickedness in a slasher, but even the murders have been bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event that motivated the massacre lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% and explained quite well what happened. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims were invited to the "meeting" in an abandoned school in which all the public services were lit. One of the victims found this strange, but they dismissed it and decided to return anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the murders were so false that they were virtually impossible to follow. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see breasts and breasts not very good at it. This film makes the Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
