Herculis Puaro is in general a well-established "hero" whom we know well in books and movies. This film or story does not work and I felt that it was not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the actors exaggerate and make stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even the Arab clothes) looks fake and for the serious viewer who thinks twice that this film can to be seen as a comedy of the mystery drama. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro does a good job but nothing fantastic. As said before, the scenes are perfect and look like fakes. The story is not very enchanting, although it is a mystery murder, but who cares about the death of a vicious and vicious blonde woman of more than 45 years in the desert of iraq ? The "victim" is not nice.
