The first part, Che in Cuba, concerns this part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles, and Che's ministry touches too many indiscriminate wounds (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never arrives in Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is to guess what. It contains too many indiscernible battles and Che takes care of too many indiscriminate wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized it was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew anything other than the title before I started), I naturally thought of the greatest epic of all, Lawrence of Arabia by David Lean. More of that later. <br /> <br /> Do not be racist, but apart from what I already mentioned, it's the fact that there are too many characters that are, well, indistinguishable - unknown Hispanic actors who look the same, especially if you consider that they all wear the beard "Che" and all wear the lattice Che. As a result, the viewer can not identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro is great, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You have the idea. <br /> <br /> the other characters being interchangeable, this leads to a loss of reference. When Che's main collaborators are killed, you do not feel remorse because you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I do not think it's a spoiler), the audience feels no empathy - he just killed him. <br /> <br /> He is too uni-dimensional to be considered a human being. In addition to being a revolutionary and the second behind Jesus only in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married and has five children (he tells another character that he is nearing the end). What was his motivation? A complete riddle. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh voluntarily looks like lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know Lawrence, the mysterious man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as unsure of himself, that is, he had human qualities. Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, there was another epic of the war, Mongol. Che makes me look like Mongol, it's a wonderful life.
