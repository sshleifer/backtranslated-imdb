The original series of Lensman novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure SF adventure with a substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood did not film it textually because it was the kind of thing they like: massive explosions, the super-weapons, the superheroes, the girl hero, extraterrestrials (great potential CGI), well against the evil in its purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I'm a lover of Japan and cartoons), we get this horrible children's film that tears the guts of history, mixes with Star Wars (ironic since this last tears the books occasionally), pastiche and idiot, up to the level of "Thundercats". See Kimball Kinnison, the incarnation of the galactic patrol officer and Lensman, second stage, portrayed as a little boy is pitiful (etc.). I simply do not understand why the authors did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and they could have made a lot more money by saying all right. It does not mean anything.
