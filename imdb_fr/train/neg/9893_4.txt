I only hope that no classicist / ancient historian saw "Cleopatra", or, if they saw it, that they took it for a laugh. The film is horribly inaccurate, and even laughably, than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well written script whose historical mistakes are well articulated and fit the story well). The most flagrant is Octavius, the heir of Caesar, in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says, "Caesar Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculously dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela does his best to be the alluring Pharaoh (who in real life was not handsome at all), but turns out to be amazing. <br /> <br /> This is a warning to all historians - this film is not true to life!
