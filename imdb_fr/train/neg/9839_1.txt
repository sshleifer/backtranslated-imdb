The beginning of this film was good. It started to get really stupid after telling people he wanted to kill himself. I think that if I came from a small town like this, I would be offended after watching this movie. They made a lot of these people stupid and crazy. How would these people have so little to do that they follow him all day? Often, these people told him ways to kill themselves as if they were urging him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for others? I also think they could have done a much better ending for this movie. There were also good roles in this movie. Some people might like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
