I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I just saw makes sure that all of her video clips from the past few years are similar to her successes in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> A secret bio lab makes a new type adrenaline of man to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Seagal is supposed to somehow stop the infection or the end of the world ... or something like that. Seagal also crossed squadrons like jellybeans, every time I looked up, he ordered a new face, so it was difficult to follow the evolution of the character. I know that Steven's athmy prevents him from shouting at the top of his lungs, but why is he constantly lined up by people who do not sound like him? Usually, the film sequences and the action sequences of the film can avoid a total loss of time, but it was not even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with lots of blood and stabbing than real fighting. The problem was that it was not really scary and Seagal seemed completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have a fast movement, but that Seagal, 40, killed them all alone? I guess the only highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes when the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
