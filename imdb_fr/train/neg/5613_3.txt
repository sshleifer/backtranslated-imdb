In my opinion, this movie does not make any new thought. I seem to take a lance to a spear without looking aside! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I find that his reasoning is missing, there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. For my part, I am generally on the side of the investor, but this film lacks credibility because it is based on the fantastic observation of the man / woman on the street. really now if you want to create a credible alternative to a belief held for more than 2000 years, you must make an extra effort to allow the other party to make its convictions heard. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film, it looked like an attack on the crystalline faith. I am not a believer, but I consider the beliefs of others, and I would not ridicule them, but try to understand and tolerate.
