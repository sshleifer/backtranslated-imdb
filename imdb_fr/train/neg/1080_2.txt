How would an Altman Experience Director expect us to spend time with a neurotic, whiner, idiot with no redemptive character, or worry about what happens to him? him? piece of work deeply confused. A monstrous trash. In addition to this disabling flaw, the plot line requires a serious concentration to follow. The configuration in which the character of Branagh evolves is so obvious from the beginning that we are inclined to ask ourselves if the author and the director have totally lost the respect of their audience. This last theme is at the heart of the film: it represents a personal indulgence on the part of the director, with a deep contempt for the taste, the values ​​and the intelligence of the spectator. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
