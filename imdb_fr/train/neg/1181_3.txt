the film has long been the subject of a scandal that has made it a very popular object ... indignation, mystery, etc. He had everything to be a good movie, but failed in all areas. it's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lame erotic film. <br /> <br /> the 2-disc DVD includes a superb booklet with still images, interviews, bestiality tests, etc., as well as a long interview with the more than pretentious director. for those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic as long as the film will not be seen. the disc 1 contains the film mounted, poorly translated into English but with a good visual quality. the disc 2 contains the director's cut, in a terrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the beast? a hand puppet from Kermit the frog would have been more effective and more shocking.
