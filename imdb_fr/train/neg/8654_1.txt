The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a Joeseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness scam, the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <The claims made outside the DVD box were blatant fraud: Take this journalist's death and present it as a factual reality <br /> <br /> while some parties have Muslims support the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks against treatment inflicted on the United States by Muslims around the world. <br /> <br /> I alerted the video store that the film should be removed from the "documentary" section and placed in the war drama zone for quasi-fictional accounts of real events.
