I will say one thing about this film: there is no rest. You can not get bored looking at this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and NEED for rest! That's the risk you take in modern action movies. You want it interesting but not exaggerated. It's way too much. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is good and has some "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still looks like a movie "B". The most interesting part is Scheider's dialogue: the only part "A" of this movie "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly based on the Rambo mentality, with some exceptional scenes. One of them was a very innovative scene involving antipersonnel mines. It was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes had to make him a guardian for a long time.
