Jason Lee is doing his best to amuse a silly situation, but the film fails to make a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems embarrassing as a connivance and sexy to become soon her step-cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been projected in the opposite direction. (Selma Blair seems more complicated than Julia would be). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is a new banalization in Hollywood of a possible situation in the real world (being caught at a bachelor party without stooping your cousin), who, even if he promised, does not keep his promises. <br /> <br /> There are bursts of laughter to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) does its best with inferior material that does not transcend its sour subject. Thus, instead of getting a successful festival (ie Animal House or American Pie), we find ourselves with a happy medium consisting of both humor and stupidity (like Meatballs 2 or something else) .
