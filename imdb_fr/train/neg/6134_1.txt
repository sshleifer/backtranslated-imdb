If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt my money was not totally wasted. <br /> <br /> Then, I saw Steven Segal's On Deadly Ground. <br /> <br /> This film should see a resurrection of course on MST 3K. If Santa Claus conquers Martians can blow up the head of Tom Servo, one wonders what this film could cause in this film. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason for Kurt Thomas to never make a film. The writers of this dreck should be forced to carry signs every day of their lives that say "Bitch slap me!" I was a writer on Gymkata. "
