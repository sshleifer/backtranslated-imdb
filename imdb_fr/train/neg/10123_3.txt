I guess when Hitchcock's experts and experts get together, we're not talking about Master's big movies like "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train," but from a lesser-known effort like this. 1931, obscure and badly defective. , which presents the great director in a nascent form. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class London couple who are reluctant to stay in front. He blames them for their fate; she accepts it. The change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, in which it is said that he will organize them so that they can enjoy a life of planetary luxury. They make plans for a world cruise. But their problems are just beginning. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Marion is indisposed for the moment, but you see the idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candles, preparing at best for a perilous journey. This may be Hitchcock's first foray into this theme, not his most memorable success. Hitchcock tries to mix the comedy with another element, in this case a national drama rather than suspense, but the two are not coherent, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The hills are a flat and dull couple, without chemistry or personality. When they meet at the Folies Berg√®re, in the form of cinematographic sequences that seem ten years older than the rest of this film, they marvel at the outfits of female performers. "The curtain is up too soon!" gasps Emily. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the hills move away from each other during a cruise at sea, it seems that a mercy kills more than a tragic thing, even if the people with whom they unite are drops, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) is carrying pictures of him sitting next to empty chairs, which he suggests replacing with Emily. The daughter of Fred "the princess" (Betty Amann) has the eyes of Clara Bow and the shadow of Wallace Beery at five o'clock. There is also a hateful passenger, a clumsy old maid Hitchcock always presents with a horny tail. Subtlety was yet to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is turned abruptly, with a confused block and a tense dialogue. Hitchcock tries to start a comedy with Fred and his umbrella that does not come off, and Kendall seems to aim for laughter while Berry plays tears. When Fred and Emily separate, we see them jostling on a pair of stuck rickshaws, one of many clumsy attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely friendly character, in part because she really cares about her husband and son get angry about her affair with Gordon, but mostly because she's one of the first magnetic blondes from Hitchcock, his platinum curls whisking his face like a Botticelli aboard the discovered deck of a Chinese junk near the conclusion of the film. > <br /> Things end with a dangerous situation that will allow the protagonists to attack and possibly repair their relationships. Only they are not active participants in the resolution and, with the exception of the fate of a friendly cat, nothing resonates on the end. <br /> <br /> At least you'll have a nice view of London in the early 1930s, and a chance to see Hitchcock while he was still working for food. "Rich And Strange" is what Hitchcock pays his debts and learns his trade, a profession for scholars but not for casual film lovers.
