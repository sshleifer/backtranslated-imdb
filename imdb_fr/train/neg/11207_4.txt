A big fan of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman books, I could not wait to see Flashy on the big screen at the release of this movie. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment at that time. So I left that alone for 20 years before coming back to watch again, but it was not better the second time. Mr. Fraser is an extremely skilled writer, but I'm not a fan of his screenwriting work with Richard Lester. The penchant for burlesque spoiled me 'The Three Musketeers' and it's the same here. For me, the tone and feel of the movie are wrong. Flashman books are incredibly funny, but they are adventure novels. The adventures of Flashman are very serious. After all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in novels, but not at all on film because of its comic style. It's an incredible shame, because it could have a good movie if it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I read for the first time that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to be performed by Oliver Reed. I was happy because Reed was for me the epitome of Flashman. How I would have liked to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but he does not fit the picture of Flashman created by the books (too skinny! Flashman is supposed to be a big fat guy). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it's done like a comedy. The only scene in which he creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills Gautet (Tom Bell). It's a shame, because production values, costumes, sets, etc. are superb and the cast is generally excellent - just about everyone in the film is staged except Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps the direction of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, because a recent radio adaptation of "Flash For Freedom," adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked rather well. Maybe someday we'll see Flashman do justice to the screen.
