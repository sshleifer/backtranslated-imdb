This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two separate stories or more in a single film. Other critics have of course also because there are several mentions of the "first part" and the "second part". How can you have a character development or a deep plot when the characters and story are presented for such a short period? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped abruptly (it does not stop, it stops just in the middle of the story) to be replaced by a stupid and totally unbelievable second part that seems focus on a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai will receive a decent script to work!
