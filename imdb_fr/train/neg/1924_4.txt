DR. SEUSS 'HOW THE GRINCH CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday movie inspiring the spirits of the season and extending Dr. Seuss' classic fable, do not see not "Dr. Seuss" How the Grinch stole Christmas. "If you're old enough to read this review, then you're probably too old to enjoy this movie, it's full of color, a creative production design and an imaginative build of sets and costumes, loads of joyful noises, and the characters are made up to look like the inhabitants of the fictional village of Whoville, but unfortunately, the film's positive elements end there, the rest of the production is just an excuse for Jim Carrey to laugh at the screen while giving a diabolical smile, while digging into the scenario too broad and with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Many people recognize the story ... how the grinch flew Christmas in Whoville, so I will not lose my time to write a detailed synopsis to read, however, I will say that the story of the film is performed in three major acts, the development of grinch and scenery, the Whoville festival and the vision of the wicked Dr. Seu ss of the villain who stole the Who's from their Christmas. There are many familiar names in the credits here, but no familiar faces. As in "Battlefield Earth", I simply do not see why producers would engage expensive actors just to keep their identities protected by make-up and unrecognizable costumes. Anyway, there is Molly Shannon of SNL in the role of Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his voice to the narrator of the film and Christine Baranski is the only lost lover of Grinch. <br /> <br /> Too much focus on the little Cindy Lou. The scenario of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman gives the impression that he goes everywhere in the cinematographic landscape; Director Ron Howard has little or no interest and the screenplay is predictable, too big and artificial. The only character to whom a distinction is attributed is the Grinch himself, all the other characters are puppets of the plot, without form and without interest. And the dialogue is too zealous and too old to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity! <br /> <br /> Factors that buy the film go to the talent of the decorator Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack and the large makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very beautiful production. The sets and atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it's as if the public were visiting a world like a dream. The people of Whoville are smeared with makeup, to the point that we can not tell the actor to recite lines without humor. Although dazzling, I really can not attribute performance because they are neglected due to the support of the expensive technical department. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is an actor I can talk to. His performance is what almost destroys the film itself. He is far too selfish like Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be almost recognizable as Seuss' work. Surprisingly, although there are some fun moments due to some cunningly clever sequences, no laughter comes from Jim Carry's crazy nonsense. It's almost as if the movie was written specifically for Carry to exaggerate his role. This factor only leads the film to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only the pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". After this film, historians should consult the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have returned to his grave. <br /> <br />
