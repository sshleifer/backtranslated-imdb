Honestly, if someone has a brain, there is not a positive thing to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 by praising this. I would rather laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> all the actors must have been bored or have no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * whatever the spelling * was better than all the actors of this movie, when he played a psychopath in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and you have something good to say, your IQ must be extremely weak, with such a bad taste in movies, it hurts. Thank you ... and the TRUTH has been pronounced! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Recover the devil's rejects, it's now a classic.
