It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and the same actors participated in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring and is not going anywhere. Where did the spirit go? I am confused. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. It's not the fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or brilliant (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame rests entirely on the plot, the dialogue and even on part of the shooting (a limited budget is not an excuse). A huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry for not being able to pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, I'm disappointed ... if you like this one, you might not like Henry Fool so much ... the two films have nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the personality of the characters ... it's a fraud to attract fans of Henry Fool for they watch the rest. <br /> <br /> I turn off that by turning off now - Henry in a sort of prison with a Taliban?!?!
