Well, it's official. they just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others were awful. I mean, the story is about two university fraternities fighting over their homes. Now let's talk about a weak conspiracy, the first three relating to growth, change and marriage, all of which are important points in the development of human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke. I know it's hard to compare to Steven Stifler but there's no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2 or 3 funny bits in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie is of course Jim's father. I do not know why he keeps doing these things developed movies.
