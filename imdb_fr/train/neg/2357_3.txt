Hope this is the last nightmare. It's the quintessence of a good thing that went wrong. Okay, there is still pleasure to live, but in the most banal sense of the world. Rachel Talalay was present for the duration of this franchise, was part of the production staff and even produced. I do not know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes with the human video game man and the presence of <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I'd like to get an idea of ​​what she was thinking when she wrote / realized this disappointing trash. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than a glorified popcorn movie instead of looking like horror, with the artificial use of a 3D end. Are these glasses not cool? And you get to keep them! That's the equivalent of, you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here are 10 cents. Now, do not feel special !? Sorry, but for me it just did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another facelift. This one was for the worse, I think. All the artistic beauty that had dominated his "look" in previous films was replaced by a set of prostheses obviously cheaper and less detailed. It looks ... less like the burn it's supposed to be, and more like a skin disorder. Changing the composition of the main role so far in a series is about the same level as the change of lead actor. But wait! They did it and did it. So I guess it does not matter. But that mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another low-rent monster like the Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a black comedy than the classic horror promised by this series; stuffed with what you can only hope the writers thought were simple minds and intelligent repartee (unfortunately, it did not work on both sides). <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say than grabbing the popcorn and getting ready to laugh, because there has not been a scary or suspensive moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> He notes a 3.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the demon :.
