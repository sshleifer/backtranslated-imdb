A retired diplomat, well played by Michael York, travels to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who murdered the son of his policeman. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him to bring the gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old 1980s action movies that still portray the Russians as bad guys to undermine the just American government. It is interesting to see this time the Russian as a hero. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, it's really an action movie "B". Michael York gives class to this mediocre film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop, is a little "blah-blah" but, surprisingly, he has some chemistry with Michael York. Look at it, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with everyone with whom he would make a scene. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul had been in this movie longer, it would have been an above average action movie "B". All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he's really nice to watch during the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical villain. He is very blond and very mean in this film. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there is nothing else to watch on TV. It's okay. That's not so bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could have been much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
