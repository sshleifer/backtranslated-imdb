I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but I am open to all kinds of points of view or opinions. It does not matter to me if Jesus existed as it is written in the Bible. Whether Maria was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What makes me angry is when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact but without showing the context, it was written. For example, they showed in this film the following phrase: "My enemies who did not want me to rule over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they do have not done. you are the context. Jesus told the story of an evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports the massacre. He is love! After quoting the false Bible, they present people screaming (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. The majority of viewers do not check the information presented, so they begin to think that Jesus = hate = is good for me and no one else. It's pure manipulation. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own base, our civilization if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message he has given us. You have seen the branch on which you are sitting.
