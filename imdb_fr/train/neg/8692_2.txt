I think that Elisabeth Rohm, even if she does her best, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of the budget that she was perhaps the only one who could get that award. I mostly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and probably the most convincing to watch. When he was not on the screen, the thing is dead. It was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me goosebumps, but rest assured that in real life, he is a kind and funny compassionate man. He even said that playing this role gave him goose bumps. <br /> <br /> I will look at anything with him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as thrilling as fluff on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
