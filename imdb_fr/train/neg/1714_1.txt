Once again, a film classic was needlessly redone with predictable and disastrous results. The title is wrong like everything about this movie. The period is not convincing and the tracks seem far too young and too empty to be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view and was directed by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, it would still be a useless movie. The 1967 version departed from the facts and presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967, and it offered exceptional performance that allowed you to worry about it. This remake of 1992 seems from the original film rather than the truth as it is known and actors of this version are callous, unattractive and not at all interesting. Obviously, ignore it and hope that the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
