It's probably the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens with the casting. The main woman in this film has a kind of disfigurement of the nose and it is almost impossible to watch her for any period of time without focusing on her nose. you could go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoons and easily find 50 more qualified and beautiful women leaders. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD box. This film looks like a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I would have preferred to spend the time at least where this movie was watching public access TV ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than the ones you will see in this movie
