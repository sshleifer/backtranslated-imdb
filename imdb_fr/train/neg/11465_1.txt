This is without a doubt one of the worst photos I've ever paid - the kind of movie you choose in desperation at a movie theater in a mall during the Christmas holidays, when you've missed the start times for a good thing but you are still dead ready to see a movie! And that's exactly how I saw this stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> Over the span of most of three decades, I can still smell the decaying fish that makes up this history. The incredible plot - that a killer whale grudges against an individual who is not from the sea - is laughable. And that's about all, with the exception of a completely irrelevant "love theme" that is played out at the end of a film devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is charming (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris is just chewing the scene. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and he is not a Jaws. Fortunately, I have forgotten the essential and when I meet him on television, I immediately move on. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See the current advertising ad showing a husband and wife watching the whales ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least everything is over in sixty seconds. This film represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never find again.
