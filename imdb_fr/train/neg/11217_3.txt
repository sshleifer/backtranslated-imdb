So, the woman and I have just finished it despite several threats to extinguish it. Most of the boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just very little enthusiasm. The acting was atrocious, to the point that we actually laughed a few times during some of the worst scenes (the lady of the church for example). The deceased sister used paranormal means to contact her living twin, although she instead sent her useful information to try to scare her, which was very similar to the Ring. Rather than involving the police - which I'm sure is due to the fact that her earplugs have DNA - she is instead developing a horrific plan to "get" the man who concealed the accidental death of his sister. I call it a horrible plan because in the end, it allows him to kill it too, what the film fades to become black. Bad dialogue, bad action, bad end.
