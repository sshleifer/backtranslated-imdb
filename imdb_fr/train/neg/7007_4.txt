It's a very bad movie. The plot is sentimental boiled. I guess the production values ​​are OK, a correct photograph, a discreet direction and all the rest. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never really cared about him, and this film validates this perception. It's no wonder he never had a career outside of his "Star Wars" movies. I'm just going to say "Good bye, Mark" as he sinks into the well-deserved darkness. For its part, a very young Annie Potts completely stole the show. She showed charm, beauty and playing chops in a performance. I remember seeing her in Texasville recently and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting to see it ten years ago. Anyway, unless Miss Potts interests you, run away screaming for the hills.
