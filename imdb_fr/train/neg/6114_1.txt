Because that's all she does throughout this film is to get naked for no good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, she suddenly removes her clothes. All this movie is fucked. They did not manage to get the kind of animals for this movie. What does an orangutang do around these chimpanzees? He must have wandered from the scenery of a much better movie. The group of men from the Cannibal tribe And why were Bo and his father painted if they were to be eaten later? It was probably a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her father on the hunt approaches and stupidly acts around a bull elephant. Any African bull elephant that was not circus would have crushed that idiot's buttocks. Any intelligent hunter would have started shooting the moment he saw it. And I can not help wondering if the camera was in LSD, as he continued to show various scenes that were taking place in slow motion for no good reason. It made no sense. The boa constrictor with which Tarzan struggled in the water was like one of those 12 rubber greenhouses that you can buy at a Spencer Gifts store. Tarzan was strangely I do not apologize, but it's a scam. a Tarzan movie classic in black and white, with a similar but better story. Do not mention the plot. There is a scene in this movie I saw that everyone had forgotten to mention it. * (ALERT SPOILERS) * The scene where he tries to save Jane and his father is too close to a stream of running water. It looks like he is urinating on someone below him. And he, too, Jane and him are laughing on a beach with evil monkeys who jump and applaud.It took the death of his father. * See Bo too naked in this movie will make you blind.
