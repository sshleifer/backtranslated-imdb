Ironically, although he can do the split, Thomas is a complete actor. <br /> <br /> This film is etched in my memory as one of the most depressing and incompetent films I have ever seen. As such, I like it rather a lot. <br /> <br /> Yet the only reason he gets more than one star is that Thomas has a great physical fitness, and it's fun to see his muscular and tiny body perform various gymnastics exercises on rocks and irregularly shaped poles about the Eastern European countryside (including the famous "horse in a row" in the form of a cap well in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various senseless villagers). But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to change, and any illusion that he might have a career in the cinema is immediately broken. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least the excuse that he was not really an actor. Everyone in the movie - actors, directors, editors, cameramen, etc. is at least as bad or worse, and most of them are professionals. So, Kurt is not doing as bad as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If someone asks him again to perform in a martial arts film, I bet Thomas kicks him in the face.
