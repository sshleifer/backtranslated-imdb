This film started well, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Much too quickly, I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answer to why they were doing what they were doing. All the actors were superb, but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were really fun. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this film to casting agents. Look at the first scenes and then find something better, otherwise you will be totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin in a video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the rarity of this film, I feel like it was a good price.
