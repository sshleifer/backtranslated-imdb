This must be accompanied by a special classification and a warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the dirtiest bodily functions becomes a nightmare. In addition, it is obvious that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everybody - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hate makes him blind and he forgets now the job he once did. <br /> <br /> This so-called "film" is just a frightful series of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professional knowledge. It's an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
