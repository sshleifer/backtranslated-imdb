I must congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong, you're not as talented as you think, you can not catch all the hogwash of low-cost amateurs, whose only goal must be to make money. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad, and I mean bad. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better. <br /> <br /> The acting game, let's just say: do not go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have a lot of experience! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, find your goal in life, you really are zero as a director. Your staging is mediocre, the angles are screwed up (not in the right direction), the lines seem as if they were read on toilet paper, and the damn music .. it always comes back when it should not and leaves without apparent reason. And do not go writer either, by the way. Making movies is not like serving in a coffeshop, it takes art and skills, things I doubt you'll ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a hellish shooting movie, you should have turned this one back to oblivion and wait until something good has come .. Or just go find a job in a coffeshop. You will have less stress and you will save money and a bad night to moviegoers. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first)
