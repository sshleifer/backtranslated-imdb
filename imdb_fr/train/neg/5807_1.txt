Do not worry even with this movie, it's bad when you judge it on its own merits, but when you compare it to the 1972 original (which is a classic), it's terrible. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 film is bad compared to the book. It's silly, movies should never be judged in relation to the books from which they are extracted. These are 2 completely different art forms (as if it were to be reported but apparently it is). If you use this criterion for all movies, "2001" would be zero, as well as "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
