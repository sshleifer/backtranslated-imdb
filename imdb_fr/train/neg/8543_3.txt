I admit that I had to go through this misdirected DVD quickly after about 30 minutes - nothing happened and everyone has already described the "plot". But did anyone mention the opening scene: a butcher's knife is stabbed with a wig and is impaled on the grass in the front yard! I guess the moron kid did it, put that never explained. A truly triumphant opening. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a more written or thought-out film, because what we have left is enough and a film that makes no sense is not a film "clever" "It's just a poorly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a clean version and if there were some images missing, I'd like to see if that would help. Otherwise, it's a strange little film that is better if you pass it quickly!
