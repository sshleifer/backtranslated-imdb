What has Ireland already done to distributors looking to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This film begins as a guide for cinema students about Irish film clichés: creamy priests, spittle before shaking hands, cattle markets in the square, bike rides in country meadows against a background of anodyne folk music. Soon, however, it becomes clear that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O of Irish clichés - the religious conflict. This is a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic father's child is educated, which seems like a fairly reasonable wish, but not for the villagers of Wexford County in the 50s with whom she has to live. Rather than send them to a Catholic school, she decides to go up and go to Belfast, then to Scotland, where a few more shots are regressed. While she is there, her father (who looks suspiciously like George Lucas) and his family at home are subjected to a boycott that turns out to be very mean. I'm not going to give the end, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we are supposed to sympathize with her but end up pressing her to make a living. Villagers are portrayed as fanatics whose prejudices must be taken into account, but traumatizing your children seems a very appropriate way to go about it. In addition, she tries to make connections with the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland: she tells her lawyer that she must "impose conditions" upon her return. The film is supposed to be based on a true story, but its themes have been treated with much more imagination and with less reliance on old-fashioned clichés in the past.
