Beyond the cheap dirt, this exercise of unfitness to filming a video was difficult to obtain. It has the typical gore that you expect in a zombie movie, but none of the atmospheres needed to make it worth it. <br /> <br /> What is strange is that it is a German amateur video, and the version I saw is doubled in English! The dubbers seem to be American fans (correspondents of the Germans ?!) Who can not decide if they want to play it directly or make a comedy. A character (a white German, of course) is apparently dubbed by a black, who speaks with a thick ego skin! 'Kno wahm sayin', comrade?
