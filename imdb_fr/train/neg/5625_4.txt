Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films on its various aspects. Unfortunately, his life in the film was a war propaganda that gave the best face to some of the less attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London who was barely 40 years old. when he died wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote, like everyone else, bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him. Part of that experience in another day and another time would have been condemned as racism. But it was World War II and London was a strong supporter of the "Yellow Peril", as it was called at the time. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film deals with his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor from where he had the inspiration for the wolffish. We see it in the Yukon in a hut of miners with a dog that has undoubtedly inspired The Call of the Wild. London has managed to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life has been the reality on paper for the whole world since then. <br /> <br /> The last third was spent on his war correspondent's time covering Russia. Japanese war. London was socialist, but its socialism did not include people who were Easterners. Like a few million others, he saw the increasing immigration of Chinese and Japanese on our Pacific coast as a threat to white jobs. He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart before the horse. London is portrayed as a man who understood Japan's ambitions and was as xenophobic as he was, since he was present during the Russo-Japanese war. In reality, the kind of atrocities present during the Second World War did not exist during the Russo-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but everyone too, including the United States at that time. But our immigration policies, prompted by pressure from our West Coast politicians, have greatly contributed to the deterioration of relations with Japan in recent generations. London was part of the cause and not a prophet crying in the desert. <br /> <br /> This film is the first independent production of Samuel Bronston who then shot movies on a budget a little larger than Jack London. If he had had a little more money, Bronston could have got James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would have been right to play the role. Instead, they had Michael O'Shea making his second film after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is doing well in the game, but it certainly was not a box office. <br /> <br /> While London is covering the war, he meets a Tanaka captain played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in Orientals and played a ton of them in the Second World War. From the point of view of 1905 Strengths in the best tradition of Fu Manchu The imperial objectives of Japan to win in the United States. It must have gone very well with the swing swing crowd. <br /> <br /> Many things have not been touched on in London life, including a first woman. Susan Hayward is the second and only wife of this film. She enters the movie at the end. I would have liked to see more. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband after the death of nearly 40 in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea met and married the great lady of her life at Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they married for 30 years until O'Shea's death in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday we'll have a view of Jack London will be much better than this one.
