This film was horrible, simply. It was so bad that I signed up for IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an expert on camper horror movies. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this film is bad. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the film is made up of scared individuals running across the screen. When they do not run, they spring lines without sequels, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls apart. There were so many discordant low-angle shots; I thought Leif Jonker had a tripod of 3 feet. He used what I call the "Leif Maneuver" many millions of times: that is, zooming out of an object of interest like an amateur. Apparently, the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise. So she filmed a sunset ... and played it backwards. Under this lazy direction, you are really impressed by the bloody final scene. The only thing you can understand is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) gore movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the founding movie. "Undead." If you are a schlock lover and are looking for a challenge, try "Darkness". <br /> <br /> Quote the movie- <br /> <br /> Vampire: it's time to die!
