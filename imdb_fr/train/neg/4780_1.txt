I think this drawing is one of the worst designs I have ever looked at. I would recommend this drawing to people under 5 years old. I loved this show when I was 4 or 5 years old, I only watched it when there was nothing. Now I am 5 more and I prefer to do my homework than to watch. The drawing was a bit funny, but it was not enough to make me laugh. Now that I'm older, I'm interested in an exhibition that is not rated. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This caricature did not last very long, she had only 6 seasons. It was canceled because of the low number of viewers, but some people say it's because screenwriters are running out of ideas, but most other series have at least 8 seasons.
