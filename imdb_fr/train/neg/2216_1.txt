I'm a B movies lover, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in paradise. These movies are good for you to stop thinking about everything that is happening in your world. Even a stupid movie B will make me laugh and I will always consider it a good thing. There was also Hammerhead, which was so awful that I had to register with IMDb to warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man, which the film barely touched. In order to keep viewers interested, they made sure there was blood every few minutes. During an attack scene, the camera moved away from the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood thrown by a machinist to let you know that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back in science, I found it very interesting that the women tested were held naked and that the test equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway, this movie had a mediocre development of plot, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say that I'm a bad actor. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could not save this stinky.
