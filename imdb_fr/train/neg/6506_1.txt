If you are not a film student and you have to see everything, this movie will not only be a waste of time and money, but also a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry. <br /> <br /> A story that is worth telling somewhere inside, but Hopkins decided to hide and encode it under so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio video microcoupes, which weakens the spectator's patience after a very short time. Someone like Hopkins would choose a project as heavy, very difficult and extremely unstable, as his first scenario, his first score and his third film can guess. Maybe he played with that in his mind for so long, until it became unrecognizable, not even for himself. The result proves that he has by far neither the experience nor the skills to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest films of Carpenter and Lynch, to name just two unconventional filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% fewer characters and 99% more stories. more. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony, you were targeting the stars, but unfortunately you missed a few light years. Stand in, because in this department, you are a giant without equal and nobody should ask you more, not even yourself!
