Greetings again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my favorites of all time in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had beautiful films ("Rainman"), but has always provided something interesting ... until now. I think the worst thing you can say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. Never a big fan of pure slap sticks ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was amazed at how horrible this movie is. There may be 2 little laughs in all - if you can be careful as long. The best part of the film is the current gag of the title song of a sound similar to Redbone. If the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that they all want to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world reveals a weakness. SNL cast member Amy Poehler is in her usual role as a caravan basket that has become a princess. The disaster of the movie is Black Jack and Ben Stiller. The first daily works together open promising prospects, but their chemistry then disappears because of the bad scenario. This script is like most ideas of the character of Jack Black - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
