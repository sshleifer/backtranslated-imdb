A pent-up housewife (an annoying and agitated Angie Dickinson, whose body is treating / horrifying us with an extreme close-up of her delicate clothes) gets bored of her husband sexually and decides to diversify. This translates directly into a series of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, I am clearly mistaken if she can earn $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to watch De Palma scam (excuse me, "pay homage to") Hitchcock, look at "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", although loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the most insane thrillers I've had the displeasure of sitting on. The plot is absurd and tired. It offers surprisingly effective graphic killing scenes that should appeal to all horror fans, provided that they overcome the silly storyline, which was to be dated even in 1980.
