I found the documentary titled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his work, showing love and pleasure for his work. <br /> <br /> The saddest part, I must say, should be the subject on which these people work / study. They were interesting for about five minutes, after which they became boring and very long. <br /> <br /> The video was filmed in a very creative way. I really liked the film of one thing with a dubbed voice over another. It was excellent and also coincided with the music.
