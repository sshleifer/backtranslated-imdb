An interesting idea involving another dimension inside a hospital. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old episodes of the Twilight Zone. Strong atmosphere, editing was great. There have also been some very intelligent "time loop" moments that still have that appeal for fade. The story contained many vague references that led me to believe that all the strangeness that would ensue - time slips / ghosts / a strange bat-winged demon and a pretty ridiculous heavy metal ghoul would explained. And it was Dark, Dark Floors let me down. Based on my viewing, the movie gives no explanation of what is behind the events. A certain ambiguity is always expected / welcome in this type of films. Dark soils have brought him to new heights of waves. I do not expect things to be wrapped in a pretty ribbon, but I should not be left feeling "Uh? ... Is that it? ... Did I take a dose? Maybe I hit the chapter without error by mistake? " Dark Floors left me a deeply unsatisfactory suspicion that "Everything was a dream", which is a shame because until the last minute, I was really on board and I enjoyed the movie.
