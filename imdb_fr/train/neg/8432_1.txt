Let the geniuses, like the Spanish director Ventura Pons, convince the most senior members of his country to subsidize this misguided film. The sad situation of the film industry in this country is the result of trying to make a film with such a fine material. Most of the images taken in Spain belong to two categories: those on the Spanish Civil War, who like to present the history of the past as writers consider it useful. The other type of film shows the viewer a lot of free sex because the "creators" have no interest in saying. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the film, we observe Pere's penis which tries to cut it and places it in one of the trays of a party. Later, Sandra will show everything she has been given to the public to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happy, is wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film is centered on an older and better-made photo of Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but alas, it has nothing to do with the mess that we are punished for watching in this endeavor. Regarding the comments submitted in IMDb, all the negative votes come from Spanish viewers, which says a lot!
