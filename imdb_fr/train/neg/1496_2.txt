Evil Breed is a very strange film that is unfortunately not good. The beginning of the film looks promising, but overall, it is a disaster. The dialogue is rather bad but not as serious as the acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable. Most of the characters perform there lines horribly and even if it's on purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying.Some killings are innovative, but it took far too much time to get there.After about half an hour of reading the film the first death (except at the beginning) and almost all other characters are smoked within five minutes. The film then turns into a kind of parody with ridiculous characters, an unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which a man pulls his intestines out of his body. None of the movies is funny, it's just ridiculous. The movie becomes ultra-gore and ultra-useless. Most characters are clich√©s, even for standard slasher, and are also strong Ter left on the counter for 5 days .Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad, so he fails in his main task.Off the Texas chain saw massacre, Just before dawn or see no harm for a real slasher.
