He has a good name, but that's it and you will not get more for your money. In fact, the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film may give you a funny look, but the story will go from one side to the other with no particular reason and you can not understand what is happening up to what the action disappears. <br /> <br /> And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think he could be like that. called nothing but suracting !! .... period. The little boy who plays like his son has no sense of the game and I think it was just a favor he gave or something like that, because he had no idea what he was doing. doing. For some reason, he did it. the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could do it, but they did not do it !! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor is so bad, I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope it's as bad as possible. For people to accept these DVDs to the public in good taste, they will have to offer food, it could work. <br /> <br /> Maka
