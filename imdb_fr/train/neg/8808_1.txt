"ASTONISHING" cries the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They had to allude to the fact that such a piece of shit was never released. The film revolves around a group of girls with an illness that forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people to stay alive. Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see cut legs, heads, etc. which are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There's a lot of talk, a bit of human cooking and a strange kind of zombie hunter who traps victims of the skin disease in his closet attached to a chair, stabbing them in the head, chopping them into bits ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Considering that there is no acting talent on the bill, and that the gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the point of this spirit? Looking back at the videocassette, the manager is an "underground cult director". Would it be like these strange religious cults where they submit you to a thought when the opposite is clearly true? Because that's the only possible reason I can think of for everyone to have fun watching this tax deduction. Then, on the same paragraph, he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop that. Now, you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this film? Are you offended by the opinion above? If so, you must be a member of that sect. Do they pocket your salaries? Do you allow them to see other members of the family? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since A.Hitchcock? Tell me ... it sounds like a special dish from Panorama. And greet the critic of the Los Angeles era when you return to your colony, would you? 0/10
