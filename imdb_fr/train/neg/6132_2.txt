When I was a child, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent and bloody film ever made. I do not know who started this rumor. He was probably born of the frustration of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to see him for one reason or another. Years after the release of Gymkata, it became a perpetual film of late night and, therefore, I was able to make up for lost time. I had to see scenes of this terrible excuse for a movie over a dozen times, and I can still spot it after one to two seconds of screen. However, apart from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the rigid dialogue and the incredibly difficult frame, the film has assets. With all that is wrong with the movie, the sound is actually quite amusing. Never before has a punch or foot landed with so little force and so much volume! The sounds of canned kung-fu are cheeky, but the slowed and toned music, and the slow-motion scene of almost 5 minutes are really weird. The pursuit of demented and bloodthirsty villagers across the city is not really tense as much as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who just look in the camera and signal to this wreckage train a little fun. Could it be directed to a classic cult status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
