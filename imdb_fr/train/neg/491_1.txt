As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in its depiction of the artist's life and I was very upset and offended ... by turning his rape into a tragic love story, by the implication that his rapist was responsible for "awakening his talent", by his total disregard for his work, by the way he turned it into a sexual object, and so on, you see the idea. In addition, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi see this film and leave with this kind of impression.
