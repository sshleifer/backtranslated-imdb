Rex Reed once said about a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be precise) that it seemed to have been shot through the pomegranate juice. I remembered that as I snored through Purple Butterfly. It seemed to have been filmed through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it was worth the fact that, for much of the scene, the actors' faces are literally blurry or only visible after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> In addition, everyone was the same, so it was difficult to distinguish the characters. I call this the syndrome of the "Society of Dead Poets". <br /> <br /> There was no one to worry about, no one to be interested in dramatically, and the film did not illuminate the story over a very interesting time. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
