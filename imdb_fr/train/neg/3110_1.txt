I usually come to this site before going to the cinema because I like to see what other people think of the film. I read many reviews that said "thriller, not a horror movie". This made me try this movie. I really have to challenge these "thriller / horror" statements, because it was neither one nor the other! I almost went there and asked to be reimbursed, and so many critics have appreciated this garbage ... well, you must be easily satisfied! At the end of the film, the people behind me said aloud "what a waste of time" and I turned to them and said, "I could not have summed up the situation better." I was still waiting for something to happen ... but it did not happen. There was the potential for a lot of good scares (or thrills if you want) but nothing happened. Williams played the role very well, but I felt he was quickly changed by a mediocre script that was running and was not going anywhere. Save your money, it's a turkey that will be presented soon in a "cheap store" of a DVD store near you!
