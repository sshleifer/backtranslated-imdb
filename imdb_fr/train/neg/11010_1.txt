This film does not even deserve a. It was a total loss of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not shocking but everything was provocative and disgusting. I think my spoiler should be read by everyone. There is complete frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is NO plot, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are few and I was even delighted to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was Brian van Holt (who only got fifteen seconds, by the way). I think that may have been a mistake for filmmakers and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A film similar to this one is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing film that exists. There is no intrigue, and it's not funny. Although it's not trying to be funny. DO NOT WATCH THE FILM.
