"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, letting the earth soil his characters by adding cheap explosions, a style-inspired American cartoon style, and giving them super powers." "But sir, have not we all already made several shows in this work, let alone never give up their dreams as original creators?" "Yes, and these shows make us a lot of money, and we need more!" "But will not every man, woman and child, who grew up with these characters less time, be bored?" "Hay, you're right, fix it in the future, make them descendants of the original characters, and change the names slightly ... but not too much, you still have to be able to make the most of the success of the classics". <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can imagine why it even exists. If you look beyond the horrible profanation of our beloved Looney Toons, then this sounds like an OK show. But there is already the titan of the teenager, who is the same bloody thing. All the characters are dressed like batman, they move in a kind of ship fighting great villains, they have super powers, the only difference is that they speak like Looney's tunes and have names and similar character traits . <br /> <br /> This kind of thing falls into the category "it's so ridiculous that it's good". Think about the movie of Super Mario's brother, as well as Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check this out. If you belong to the younger generation (what this thing is meant for, in fact), and you can watch the greedy leaders go by, then run with it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you like this cartoon, I do not have a problem with you, it's the people who calculated this thing together that makes me angry. You know how piracy is said to be like stealing a car; this show is like the looting of the grave. They might as well dig up all the people involved in the original drawing, put them on a display stand, dress them in pirate costumes and charge money. If this series did not use characters (which did not look like Looney Toons) who have already made millions of studios, then everything would be fine. But no! For the shame of the Warner brothers, for shame. <br /> <br /> If I saw this as a 30-second gag on an episode of Simpson or Family Guy, I'd love it. As such, I simply can not believe that this has ever been done. I would bet everyone that 80% of the people working on this show hate it. But anyway, in 10 years, this show will have been forgotten, while the originals will live forever, or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> "In the future, Snoopy and the peanut group is back, and now he has scary lasers and may become invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the alien warlord?" Zapar villain? Grant yourself and see. "
