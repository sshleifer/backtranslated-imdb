This mess is so bad that it's not even a horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely lost in this movie. She is not even the bad guy. The rest of the actors look like porn fans and the plot is so lame that I will not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go to the end credits to hear the upcoming band TwoMarlowe perform "Better Than Sex" it's total 80 Disco Candy song. Beautiful tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. Much more entertaining than "Bleed". In other words, when you have the material necessary to copy videos, but you only decide to record the song at the end of the movie, you get a really "BAD" movie.
