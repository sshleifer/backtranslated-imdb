This movie is not funny. It's not funny. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it take you to interest you in the least in the characters or the situation. Added to this is a film as juvenile as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14- or 15-year-old students who had never met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and written a film about their incorrect fantasies about what would be an adult man. . This film is boring, obnoxious, stultifying and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as long as its 85 minutes of run time.
