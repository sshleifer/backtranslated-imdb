I borrowed this film because not only its gay theme, but the thought of role-playing really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was shot in San Francisco because I live near SF. And of course, it was nice to see plans from the Castro district (although castro is more about a gay man than a woman). But other than that, I can not really recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me and when they finally started playing "role play", I was already bored. And the role-playing scenes I saw were a little embarrassing to watch. The game leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I did not finish the movie. I would skip this one.
