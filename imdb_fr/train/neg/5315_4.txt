Kol, prisoner of space on death row, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape into the woods of America where he tries, with a new found friend, to escape from "Alienator", a cyborg female killing machine. Made one year after Fred Olen Ray's best career film, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers," he can not help but feel disappointed. As small as this previous film, but not as fun as I had with it. The movie is suitable for non-discriminating viewers on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's about all that is good for. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
