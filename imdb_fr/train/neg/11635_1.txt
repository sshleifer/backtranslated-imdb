Ok, that's something that the film should have taken as a practice and made its life shorter and smoother than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with more than 40,000 signatures + ALL asking Uwe Boll to stop making films from well-liked franchises. Blood Rayne is very strong. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times before. The acting game is an offspring, but you can only really blame the script for that. I even wonder if they even use a script. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with the original games. HELLO if you played video games, you know that the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal impulses, like a mass murder, because he crashed his foot or cheek. There is way too much history for such a stupid movie. as I have said. I would not even want to steal this movie. And for the person who says it's 'the funniest movie of 2007' .......... have a look, the news is better than that.
