After seeing "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this film is horrible, even by the yardstick of the historically low "standards" of the time. Of course, all of this is totally fabricated and prejudicial. This is what one would expect from the German propaganda of the 30's. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is trivial and cheap. It is as ridiculously obvious that even contemporary Germans have had to leave the theater keeping their noses. In a genre known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and unthinking impoliteness, this film can not even be called "bad". To reach this status, one would have to improve significantly!
