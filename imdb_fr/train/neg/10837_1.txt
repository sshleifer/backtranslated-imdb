I can not tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the least interesting and the plot is non-existent. So, having waited to see how the lives of these characters affected, hoping that the previous two and a half hours led to a significant end, what do we have ??? A storm of frogs. Now, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with no resolution, and second, it would be lost to anyone who did not read the Bible (part of the population) or Charles Fort (an even bigger part). As a rather read person, I thought this movie was a poor indulgent imitation of an episode of seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to read ... <br /> <br />
