I'm starting to see a pattern in the movies that I give a 1 to. These are almost all films that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop believing in his likes at the movies. Anyway, it's a typical behavior for pre-teen girls, but it's done even worse than usual. Once again, the writer has broken the cardinal rule of any film. He / she made the main character implausible. At first, she starts by being a perfect girl for her friend, then discovers when she turns 30 she is basically a very cool person (having business, etc.). Why would the F have felt for this person? OK, let's say we can go beyond that. Jennifer Garner is about as attractive as possible without having a kind of deformity. I do not know if it's his fault or that of the writer, but his character far exceeds my threshold of irritation. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are not fun, they are boring. By far, the most embarrassing moment of the movie happened when they danced on "Thriller". Fucking shit was painful. It showed her practicing this dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but a whole club filled with people?!? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly, she is completely incompetent and does not know how to do her job and nobody notices it. At least the character of Tom Hanks on "Big" had a job that made sense for a child. These body-changing movies that become adult night movies are getting out of control, and by far the worst.
