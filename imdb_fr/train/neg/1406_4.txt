This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in a 2004 interview that when he made movies, he wanted to make music, and when he was making music, he wanted to make movies. The best thing in "Promise Me This" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies sounded like noise. "Promise me that this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like a music video during the first 30 minutes and at times later, but there was a nice plot. "Promise me that" has no plot. I was waiting for this film with high expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters, who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes excellent dialogues, but for Kusturica, it's about "noise", and to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, which I could identify as those written by Ranko Bozic. The director used the other part of the script to make his chaotic clip for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (creator of the screenplay "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never followed the script. "Black cat white cat" was the only scenario for which Kusturica had said he would not touch him. According to Gordan Mihic, after all, Kusturica returns to the screenplay and, if he does not, he does not make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise me that". He should have followed the scenario of Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is presented as a "comedy", but there are very few moments that make me laugh. The comic moments are in the same style as "Black Cat, White Cat", but are not at all funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black cat white cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know people who liked "Promise me this", they found it very positive film.
