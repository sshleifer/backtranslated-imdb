I rented this movie only because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that by seeing RR's name on the cover (as an actor), this movie would be good. It looks like a movie that Rodriguez would have done. So, if he wants to give him his name, he must be good, is not it? FALSE FALSE FALSE. By far the worst edition since "Manos Hands of Fate". The way it was edited makes no sense and makes the film impossible to follow. After 30 minutes you will not even want to try to follow him. I do not know at all how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they owed someone, but they are really good at it. In addition, they were in the movie only a few minutes each and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to see a movie with poor editing, mediocre acting and a confusing storyline, be my guest, but do not say you have not been warned.
