The director Todd Sheets is to be admired for his dedication, dynamism and enthusiasm in the field of cinema: between 1985 and 2000, he directed no less than 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombies trilogy at the bloodbath is something to do, they are probably all shit (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to confirm my intuition). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of heinous people. Students who find the detention a little more hectic than usual after being attacked by hordes of undead, who have escaped from a very secret military base located directly under their school. The director Sheets, based on a dreadful scenario by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the f-bomb), proposes a new embarrassing effort for an amateur, featuring dreadful and awful executions of his cast without talent , frightening visual effects. and what looks like the front of a giant space shuttle cardboard) and its poor quality gore (handles offal pulled under the clothes of his victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems an eternity look irritating Zombie Armageddon ends with an end of the journey in time / paradox that forces the viewer to watch again several tortuous minutes since the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets, what did we do to deserve to look again?
