It's a really lame parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, humorous cheese, and the role of actor as well. But after all, this is a basic movie, which is expected and does not matter, because what you really want is sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there is hardly any. Which gives you the impression of watching TV at 3 o'clock in the morning. Independent films are in progress and the one that was shot was directed by a college student who leads nowhere in this industry. You have a very long time to wait for a real sex scene. Often, you think something is going to happen, and then let it hang around. The only one (maybe two or one with two parts) that goes somewhere is very nice though. Personally, I can not recommend it unless you find it in an empty bin for a dollar or two. If you're looking for a good movie with intrigue and good acting, you do not want it. If you are looking for a good lesbian soft core movie, you do not want it either.
