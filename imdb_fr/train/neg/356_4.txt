The shape of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists, setbacks and excitations. Sometimes it's really a film "on the limit". But he disappoints and disappoints severely. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is not credible; his character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but I will only say that the character we met at the beginning simply could not be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second big disappointment of the film is that, finally, it is little more than a bloody movie. There is little qualitative difference between this film and one of the films of "Friday the 13th". Not all movies need to be in good taste, but this film does not drip occasionally. <br /> <br /> Although the film presents the magnificent Sean Connery, even if it does not correspond to its usual criteria, and seems to walk in the paces.
