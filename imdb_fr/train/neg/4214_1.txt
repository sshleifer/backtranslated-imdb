After spending just a few hours watching this and for 80% of that time totally incredulous, I can give this trash the price of the turkey of the year, no problem. To say that the plot was incredible is a big understatement. Frankly, I'm lost for words to describe this total guts. Not only are the characters completely and completely devoid of originality (this kind of thing has been done much better in dozens of 'movies to kill'), but the acting has been terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who have been paid to do it, I hope you will return your money. Believe me, many new versions are much better. Will see.
