The story is about the life of ordinary people in Antwerp living their lives. So I said it, and there is nothing more to tell of the story. The film is fast, like an MTV movie, and well photographed and we think the director is talented and should do more movies. So forget this one and hope for the best with the next picture of Deus-Barman.
