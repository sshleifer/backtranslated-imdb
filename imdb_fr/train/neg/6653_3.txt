I just saw this movie and I must say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her lines unnaturally and she had a very unnatural facial expression throughout the film. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we have seen it many times before. She separates, he finds another, she is jealous, he separates from the other girl and they end up together. There were no surprises at all, we knew that Eva would separate and that Adam would "bind" to Petra. The only thing anyone saw coming was that Petra had told Adam to go after Eva at the party. She became serious, which is a side of Petra that viewers had not seen earlier in the film and told her to regain the heart of Eva, who was really cute. <br /> <br /> In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is not a single actor who gives a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
