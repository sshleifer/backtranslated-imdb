It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality came from the memories I had of the previous movie that contrasted with the "new" personalities (or their absence). I seriously thought that the opening scene was an Ariel nightmare because of its absurdity. It was serious. It reminded me of all the annoying Disney characters: everyone is hyperactive and the story goes from action to embarrassing scenes without any real connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the horrible song - not catchy no wonder. In the original, Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the songs are catchy and fun. You remember it and want to sing it. But the songs in this movie were not creative at all. it's as if they speak with an annoying singing voice, rather weakly disappointing. I do not have this desire to sing them that makes me think that you normally get a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's as if nobody wanted to do this movie, so they barely made an effort. . . this film would need a new story, new catchy songs and more warmth and excitement without the annoying "look at me! look at me! I'm so annoying!" mentality of this Disney generation. : '(
