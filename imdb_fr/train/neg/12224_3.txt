Barbara Streisand directs and plays the lead role in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To have a chance to get an education, Babs disguises herself as a boy, which is not the hardest thing to do because she already looks like a boy, anyway. In her new school, she meets many classmates who have no problem believing she is a guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best of several moments of unintentional humor when Babs's friend thinks she's a man. but the pin on the ground, sits on him and looks affectionately in his eyes .... * sneering *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre film; splashy story of nothing particularly interesting.
