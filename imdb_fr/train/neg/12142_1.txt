Please, for God's sake, do not look at him. Now, by saying that, I know what you think, it can not be as bad as that? If everyone says it as bad as he says, I have to watch it! Do not do it! It will be like watching a horrible accident involving babies and a tanker! You will be marked for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch half an hour before falling violently ill. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, and I saw Barbwire !!! If you run the risk of tearing your eyes and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the scenario are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This film must be the same .... no? NO!! Writing = shit leader = garbage acting = there was no act. Still not convinced? So forever your soul will be tormented !!!
