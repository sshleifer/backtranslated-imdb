I received the DVD of the library hoping to get a good idea of ​​how things are going in the background during a big opera production. I must say that I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets of a Wagnerian production must necessarily be elaborate and impressive, and the history of their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, we get a mix of clips of people moving large landscape elements, vaguely helping with a comment that did not catch my attention. I found myself listening mainly to the background excerpts of opera music. I was impressed by the tremendous effort required to put on such a production - it went pretty well and the next time I'm at the opera, I'm sure I'll remember that part if this video - but I felt a little deceived. by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation.
