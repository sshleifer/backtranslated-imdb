My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you've seen the BBC's "Planet Earth", which most of you surely have, then you will not really like this movie. And I own all the records of "Planet Earth", I saw the very high score for this film and read good reviews about it. I was excited to see that. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started. I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes on the polar bear, I recognized them on my DVDs from my home, "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The film continued and continued over and over, my friends and I kept recognizing that the scenes were all from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very very disappointed, because I think that 90% of the images come from "Planet Earth". I say 90%, because some scenes that I did not recognize. I feel that I just do not remember it. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film is a compilation of different sequences of different discs of "Planet Earth", with a narration aimed at kids. Yes, the narration is rather kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show polar bears moving away from their mother, the narrator says, "The cubs are not human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but they do not is) so in a few words. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for kids!
