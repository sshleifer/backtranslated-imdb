wow, the group of naked brothers. What should I say. I guess I can say that this show is nil. number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play instruments. Number 2: On the ad, it was said that they were famous but no one had heard about it before the show rotten. Look, I do not really hate that, I would give it as a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is that everyone says he has such a great talent and that Nat is so deep and writes deep words. At the bottom of my ass! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, I could read what is written on the walls of a bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they did not become famous on their own, their parents are celebrities and wanted their children to be famous too, so they put on a bad show. I have the impression that it will be canceled soon.
