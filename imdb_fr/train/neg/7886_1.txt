I have nothing against religious films. Religious need to watch something on a Saturday night, I guess. But what really shocks me is when the description on the DVD box does not indicate that fact to the potential viewer. Passing religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool, brother. <br /> <br /> And even though I was a religious, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Misdirected, badly played, poorly edited, the soundtrack attempt was hilarious. The false accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes and continuity was to be expected. The only reason we missed that wasted time was that it was too late to watch another movie. You should just go to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no quality that redeems this film, unless you are of the religious kind that will immediately approve anything that could preach your beliefs to non-believers, even if it's a pile of garbage . If you are not, avoid that at all costs. Do not be deceived by the writing of the box.
