I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. The acting was not great, but it was not the real problem. The problem was the feeling of lowering that I felt in the pit of the stomach about 20 minutes after the beginning of the film. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and their little money was devoted to the cruelty they showed each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give them real personalities or just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
