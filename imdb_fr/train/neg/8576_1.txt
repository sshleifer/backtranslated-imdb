Solid comic entertainment, with musical interludes, it generates a fast pace that advances in a zestful tempo through a labyrinth of humorous and icy complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a powerful set of evil evils. The script contains all standard sliding panels, secret corridors, thunder, lightning and poison darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre engage in heavy leres and melodramatics evident from the Gaslit era. Kay Kyser and her group provided exceptional entertainment to 1940s residents trying to forget the horrors of the Second World War.
