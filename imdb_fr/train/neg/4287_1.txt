I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave it 1 <br /> <br /> It's a very boring story and it has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop were dropped and they added new stupid things instead. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason, time management is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And action scenes are not a source of joy, most of them are not ... only the first is awesome ... and there are not many action scenes, and they are all pretty short <br /> <br /> > At one point in history, the main character travels about 5 times in a few minutes ... without waiting, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: do not lose time watching this movie, it's not worth it
