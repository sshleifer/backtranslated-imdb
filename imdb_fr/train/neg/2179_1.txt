I just loved watching it and having fun with its bad movie. I saw this film through the useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you flip the DVD to the other side, they show the movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, it's grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The acting, the special effects and the plot in general are very tacky and unrealistic. "Does not she need lungs," Crow said, noticing that the head can still speak without a body, and Tom Servo just nostalgically says, "No, she has juice around her neck!" The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. This "Meow" after the fight or the scene, whatever, was classic. So, in some ways, it was a funny movie. I think for horror fans, you will probably appreciate it. To have a good time watching the MSTK3 version, you will have a crazy laugh. <br /> <br /> Version MST3K: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
