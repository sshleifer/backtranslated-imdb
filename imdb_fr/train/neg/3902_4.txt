This is indeed God's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to look as much as possible to the book. But the game was terrible. Except for Kate Beckinsale, who, in my opinion, looked a lot like Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feelings, and throughout the movie, we did not see his love "growing up" for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to want to try to "rebalance" her main role as well as that of her partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the actors. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. As a result, she did not seem to be heartbroken as she was described in the book. The movie's settings are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined that Emma Woodhouse dresses in a more elegant and elegant way than she does here. The end is too long. It's good that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a murderous end to a movie. And again, I do not see any sense of happiness on Mr. Knightley's face. To conclude, I thought that this adaptation was faithful to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed that the film was shot without any budget. I would prefer to see the "lite" version with Paltrow and Northam, although it is clear that it was designed to be a "blockbuster", rather than watching these actors (with the exception of the good Olivia Williams and the best Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script.
