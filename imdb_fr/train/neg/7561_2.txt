Anyone who ignored the original 1973 British Lion movie, "The Wicker Man", would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peevish". <br /> <br /> As a devotee of the original left with the impression of purely poor. <br /> <br /> From the sad reality of the conspiratorial forge breed that brings the force of law and order into a network of barbaric pagan rituals on a remote island in Scotland, named Summerisle (the original) Summersisle, a colony close to the Amazon off the American coast of Maine, the remake hardly arrives in its place. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunately the case of what could have been a classic remake. of a classic being altered to suit a single-minded audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) Ladies involved ... shame on your head.
