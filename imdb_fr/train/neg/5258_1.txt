Well, I rented this movie and discovered that it's really bad. This is this family with the mother-in-law and the same stupid battles in the family, then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a picture of a damaged building, strange things and a movie strange, then he asks his father to take him on a parallel trip and simply accepts, etc. etc etc ..... They go to this city that no one knows it exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying is that the film ends and you do not understand what is this movie! ! I have seen a lot of mystery movies but it was the worst, honestly, he has no description at all and I wish I had not seen it.
