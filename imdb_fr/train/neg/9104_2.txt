<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked to have done it. In my opinion, Cruel Intentions is one of the best movies made for years for teens. This prequel had some things inconsistent with the original. (Sebastian's father is married to fortune, so why does he have a rich aunt on a long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I discovered today that it was not really intended to be a new film, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing this, it seemed logical that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy against vampires is different in the form of television. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble most likely added the end of this movie, AFTER the show was not taken over by Fox. This seems to be something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just do not know where they would go with the next episode, as that would not lead to the 1999 movie (the most recent of which is the end directed directly to.) <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like was that it suggests that Sebastian and his father got married in wealth, which is usually not very attractive in this part of New York, and Sine Katharyn's mother was only an adult version, it did not seem to be what a woman in her job would do, marry a man not belonging to her social class . <br /> <br /> As a prequel, it's pretty lame. But I would have been interested to see where this series went.
