It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most heinous American slags; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in the American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer took huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when they discussed the plot, they thought it was a good idea. it's not. These are abject garbage from the very bowels of Satan himself (who probably could have written a better script if he had thought about it). Robert Jones as an exce producer, spending the money from his taxpayers (the lottery money people) for this nonsense, should report on it. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to redo Deathline ??? I ask you - camping like a Christmas tree, Deathline ... "Watch out for doors" is a classic of the very bad British movie, we really do not need a reminder. And we certainly do not need a waste of this kind, poor, second-rate, badly written, poorly developed. All this from the UK funding agency that brought us the sex life of the men of the potato ... I leave my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay ANY amount of money to see this. It's pure and absolute shit - the only thing that saves producers is that they've received a huge amount of money ... our money ... for doing it. They should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I'm stunned by the low level of this movie. That makes me, Mgr, our national film support organization thinks it's worth supporting. The British film industry has no hope until idiots direct the show. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
