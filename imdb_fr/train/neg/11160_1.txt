This type of "inspiring" saccharin is enough to make you sick. He telegraphs his feelings as the greatest semaphore on the planet. He removes from the public his own interpretation and his own feelings by making the necessary choices. The grand finale is to swim in a crying orchestration that must be supposed to function as starter cables on a dead car; I imagine that you would need such an incentive to know if you are stupid enough to watch such a simple and witty film. Streep shines and you wonder if she really has the depth of sensation on the screen or if it's just that - a screen turned on and off like a light. Because I do not see how she could find life in such a movie. Although it is based on a true story and inspiration, I am sure, the installations, performances and performances take place as in a third-class TV movie or a play in high school.
