I feel lucky to own what is called Steven Seagal's worst film. I knew I was on something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice spoke. In the middle of the film, my eyes started to hurt and I almost fell from my chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with a constantly changing voice) and his role is totally amazing (as always). Who on earth leaves people with bad mules in a ponytail in the Forces? He also engages in absolutely incredible romantic relationships with women at least 20 years old. Supporting actors all seem to have been shot in the dark - by the way, did they shoot this film in the dark with just a flashlight for lighting? <br /> <br /> It's really abominable in every possible way. Invite all your friends and organize a social event - this one is really special.
