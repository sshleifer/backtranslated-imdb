This film is a very funny movie. The violence is bad, the acting is ... Well, Dani, sing or scream, or whatever you usually do. Random chicks that carry almost anything are only used to catch sexually frustrated goth boys. Personally, I think this film is really bad. The story and the characters COULD be very good, if you tell the staging, the actors and other little fun things have been improved. But the movie is just bad, the only reason people like this shit is because it contains Danni. This movie is perhaps the worst B-rate movie of all time. And, believe me, it's difficult to achieve, especially when you're competing with Def by Temptation and you end up with a lame excuse for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, so I consider it another rotten film ... a very bad one. If Dani did that as a comedy, then go ahead. Very well done. Beyond that, I evaluate the score low, because it is sadness. Watch it when you are in a happy, happy, happy, joyful way, so that you can laugh at everything or if you are rich in drugs of different types.
