With a title like that, I do not understand why this movie just did not attract me. Certainly, there are a few crazy moments and a little gore, but the way the film was shot and the general story seemed like a silly and lazy attempt at a profuse tactic of "shock" ... The inconsistent plot begins by a guy raping and murdering a woman stuck on the side of the road. He and his encouraging brother are imprisoned until the brother breaks out and organizes his girlfriend's meeting in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they fuck and later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives are composed of her former boyfriend who raped her, a "catching" neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains that he will kill them all. She ends up killing him and then turning to the men (or pigs) she tortures and kills herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation is related to eating and destroying organs genitals - which are far from disturbing and essentially sweet. The best scene is a masturbation with a broomstick followed by a violent rape ... "I spit on your body, IP! S on your grave" was supposed to be an unofficial sequel to "I spit on your grave" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference given by the main character - suggesting that his mother was Camille Keaton. Personally, I think this statement is extremely blasphemous! This film is a boring amateur mess that looks for shocks but has failed miserably ...
