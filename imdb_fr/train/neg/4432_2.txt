Aunty Danielle is a horrible old witch who torments her loving and unconscious family out of pure malice. There may be a bit of subtext about the French colonial past, but it's mostly Danielle who does the kind of things (like deliberately giving up a little child in a park) that would soon have a man scratching his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the acting is good and there is not really any problem with the concept but it's so SMUG. My god, does this film love you? Too bad he is not as smart or as funny as he thinks. The only impulse in the series - sorry, the movie - comes from Danielle, who is becoming more and more nasty, and the only surprise comes from looking at the increasingly improbable means she is doing. That's true: as in a sitcom, as is the case, with the extra "bonus" of delusions of magnitude and a duration of 110 minutes.
