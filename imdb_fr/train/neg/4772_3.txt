Before watching this movie, I already knew it was a complete copy of Saw (with the hut-like place and the black guy who wanted us to break his hand to get out of handcuffs). The name of MJH in a movie would usually make me turn my head (uh, can we say GROSS ?!), but I still wanted to try it. <br /> <br /> At first, I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I laughed at every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I kept looking. <br /> <br /> However, the end was the biggest joke of all! I seriously sat in shock thinking, "It was the end ?! Is it a comedy ?!" <br /> <br /> I thought this pile of shit was funnier than the movie "Scary Movie" and that's REALLY say something!
