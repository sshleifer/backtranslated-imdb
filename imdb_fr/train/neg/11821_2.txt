Encouraged by the positive comments on this film, I was eager to see this movie. Bad mistake I've seen over 950 movies and it's really one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, screenplay, "playing", soundtrack (the only song in the movie - a lame country melody - is not played less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring to the extreme. I have rarely been so happy to see the end credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from getting a score of 1 is Harvey Keitel - even if it's far from his best performance, he seems to at least make a little effort. One for Keitel's obsessed ones only.
