Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-time anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very incoherent career) is studying in Africa, one way or another. She tracks him (how?) And tells him the story of a giant monster told by the natives and whose night roars can be heard throughout the jungle. Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue of the movie), who saves her from the bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time to get lost for two hours horny monkey looks and cheers . Normally, I am very open to differing opinions on any movie, but that's the only exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unbearable", which is the best summary in a word I can think of.) The Maltin Film Guide says he almost had to think of a lower score than BOMB.)
