I recently saw this 'movie' and I must say that it was the worst attempt at realization that I have ever had the misfortune to see. What was happening with Coolio? Totally unprovoked shooting on people in distress. Totally uninvolved, slow, tedious and detached. Worse than Spawn. Long live "Evil Dead II".
