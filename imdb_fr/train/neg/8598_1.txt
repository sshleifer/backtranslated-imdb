I laugh! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was so bad, though, that it was hilarious. My friend and I rented it on purpose because it looked so bad. Old horror movies are always good for some laughs. The plot stank, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrible. But I had fun watching it!
