In all honesty, The Omega Code is the worst film I've seen in a long time. For the first 30 minutes, I was stunned at my seat, trying to decide if I should ask for a refund. But since I did not pay to see it in the first place (pass), I thought I might as well stay. And I did not think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> This has happened. I'll quickly go over the weak points (including some spoilers): The horrible mistake of Casper Van Dien in the role of Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two doctorates. Characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete fool. Then there is the lame description of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; we see a lot of sensational news along with ridiculous computer impressions of the biblical code translated. Also, terrible sequences of "action": Lane escapes difficult situations without explanation, and the only moment where Lane seems in danger, it is a sequence of dream! It's cute for high school writing homework, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a movie. The rhythm was bad: after a long film, the first third of the film changes scene every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there are still far too many unnecessary jumps. And as someone mentioned, years go by, but no one (not even Lane's little girl) gets older. It was disconcerting. <br /> <br /> There are some good things, though. The quality of the film (for example, the lack of grain) is high and very attractive. The outdoor shots were well done and the outdoor shot added a touch of realism. Also, there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane asks God (finally) to help him - it turned out to be very exciting - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as savior staff. But I liked it because it seemed to me the only authentic scene of the film. Unfortunately, this was followed by a major incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the acting of the actors were badly made. Michael Ironside had nothing to do and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot had been tighter and more focused, and if the characterization had been more detailed, the movie would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In a word, the Omega code is disappointing. Do not pay to see this. I give him ** on ten stars. <br /> <br />
