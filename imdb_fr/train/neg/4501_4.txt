It is true that the Parisian setting is great. The actors are doing well. The story is a twisted game of morality. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough, you can hurt everyone along the way? In a real novel, you want less clich√©s than the man who is bored with his wife and who is ready to empty his family, and the woman who agrees to encourage him to do so. What if they looked decent and Karen Allen showed off her body? The characters are always egocentric and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of the story is "you get what you deserve". I give it a 4, only for the potential of sweeping fast through the bits "male interest".
