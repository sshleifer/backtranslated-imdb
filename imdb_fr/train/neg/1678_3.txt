I want to make a play on words "Holmes with Doors" but I can not put everything in order. WONDERLAND, suitably dirty and over-published, gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time ... but what coyote is this movie on the famous 14 inches! The Australian police films are blazing all the time and jump graphic violence instead ..... as a famous man said about the double standard of American cinema: "Embrace a breast and it is an X, stab- The action and PG 13 ".. WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long and in the end we were all happy to escape the movies. How many movies called WONDERLAND are we going to have? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and the muted color make the tone mixed, but the shaking camera becomes tiresome, as if we are speechless in front of the nostrils. Taking some benchmarks of THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, everything becomes forgotten the next day.
