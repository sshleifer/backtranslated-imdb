This film seems completely useless. There is no reason for anything to happen, as if it was written by a little child who was bored halfway and said, "How can I finish?" And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure there is one to be quite frank, but if there is one, he did not register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs, getting up, as you do. They go into a house with a very boring little girl, meet Christopher Walken who found an old woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than to continue the story and she expresses her gratitude by immediately chilling him. From there, everything becomes a bit ridiculous. A few hours of my life I would like to find!
