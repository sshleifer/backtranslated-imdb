If you want to see a movie about two totally unfriendly characters, that's it. The acting is superb, both of John Cassavetes as a crazy paranoid who, as the saying goes, they are REALLY looking for, and Peter Falk as his best friend ever to whom he turns to be saved. Big mistake, but as they are both amoral gangsters and misogynist bastards, it's hard to decide who to root for LESS. Only screenwriter / director Elaine May could have managed with this one. I found it interesting that, in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman on the DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the screenplay, that it was almost impossible to work with the director , with the director of photography. impossible demands were addressed to him, namely that the crew was constantly angry at being forced to sit waiting, and so on. This mood of a VERY dysfunctional big family appears clearly on the screen.
