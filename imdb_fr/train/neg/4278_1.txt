I just took this movie for cash at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I'm being scammed. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I saw a movie as bad as this one. . Honestly. And I would never write a negative critique of a film if I did not have such respect for the subject, that is Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? It's a musical biography? Yeah, many of Foster's pieces are then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that smell more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, did someone pay to write this drivel? Second, Foster's REAL story is fascinating. Why not even come near him? Third, what did they have on the big Ray Middleton to make him do this movie? Pictures of him with little boys ?? With the communists? What a waste of a great talent. <br /> <br /> So, Foster's friends, and the truth, as well as good entertainment, be afraid ... be very, very scared.
