but they are not too numerous. Probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. Certainly the worst for this year. It is useless to comment on the plot, the casting or the acting of the actors. The problem goes beyond all that. This lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed in the toilet with some brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
