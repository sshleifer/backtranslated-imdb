Would not it be great that Not another teen movie really puts an end to all these stupid, meaningless I'm going to have more sex than you are teen movies? In a perfect world, yes. Yet this one is even worse. This one is not humiliating for the stars, it's humiliating for the distributor. All the jokes are basically students exposing stuff that people probably have NO interest in seeing, and yet it's 'funny'. Devon Sawa, who was really good in Final Destination, is simply dull in this movie. One wonders if it is deliberately bad. Grade: F
