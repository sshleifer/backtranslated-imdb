I do not know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before shooting in another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have found the motivation of his character in Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Somnambulists Slater through this dike. The direction, the editing, the sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a shootout?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on it), and good, there Nor is there a conspicuous conspiracy. I'm amazed that nobody in the project stopped and said, "Hey guys, it does not make sense, we start again." Let's hope that Slater's career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> To you the worst movie I have ever seen.
