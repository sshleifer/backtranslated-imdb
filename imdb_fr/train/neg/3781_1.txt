(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I do not really know what Dreamworks was thinking about when they decided to pay $ 80 million on this extremely tired and lame animated film. They probably thought that the spectacular animation would be more than enough to get the audience (especially families) to see it en masse. That seemed to work for the opening weekend, it brought in $ 26 million, or about $ 38.1 million. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the spectators who came over the weekend saw pretty much the same thing as me when I saw and they spread the word. It's a very lame movie, apart from animation, the script seems to have been made by a three-year-old. <br /> <br /> The film is only about 80 minutes. It's long, but it looks like an epic three hours. Some sticky points for me are, well, irritating storytelling is one of them, and it's written so obviously. At some point, it escapes some kidnappers and even if the horse is visibly scared, the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) appears to clarify the misconceptions (which would happen in the simplest mentalities. Another example is the constant pop-up of Bryan Adams' songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think it's good, but then Dreamworks really thought that the audience would be able to handle 8-9 Finally, here's a spoiler, a horse is shot at close range by a member of Calvary, not less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river Spirit (the main purpose of the film) tries to save her, but they both go in front of a waterfall that must have at least a 50-foot drop, much later in the film, towards the end, we see that this horse is alive and well, I know it's a children's movie, but even that little realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In summary, c I'm not saying that kids will not appreciate that, but everyone will check their watch while waiting for the end of these guts. Certainly on my top 10 worst list this year. - ** out of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
