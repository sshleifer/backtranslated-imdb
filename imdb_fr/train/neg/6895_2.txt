The plot is rocky. The acting game is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play. Cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I could not decide if it was a deliberately hokey movie or if the people behind this movie were actually thinking about making a good movie. Remember that Death Valley Days meet the RFD Mayberry. People running in a modern "lawless" city dressed in fast six-gun platforms. He has more than his share of cutsey. Imagine the Good Guys parking in an old farmhouse and parking the Ford Mustang just in front of a track. Imagine the employee in a hotel watching a film of American history (hemisphere) with a Japanese soundtrack but with English subtitles. All this is really strange, but could be improved if you watch it while taking part in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to all the clich√©s of Western movies you can think of. There is even a modern version of the maid of the dance hall, AND a harp of the Jew in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a movie show on Saturday night, tell them that your DVD player is dead.
