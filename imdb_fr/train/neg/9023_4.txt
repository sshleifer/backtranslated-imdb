I watched cartoons but I am not an unconditional fan; and I do not read the manga. I say this because many critics who love this movie seem to have this experience. I saw "St. John's Wort", and although it was not a masterpiece, it made me choose "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to like it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it this afternoon and I fought hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very beautiful - the slow-motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the sparkling CGI eyes - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some fighting scenes, but on the whole, it was dull like earth. <br /> <br /> It looked like someone had taken "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are cross stars lovers - and thrown in some "X-Men" for good measure. Two of the characters separated from Wolverine's powers - the guy wearing a bear suit had his claws and the gray-haired guy had the ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poisoned kiss - it's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why are they giving these women such stupid powers? Poison Girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Dude, it's a great power for you. And the other girl, can create insects from this yellow dust as she rubs her hands. The other woman, one of the star's lovers, has the power of a hypnotic look. Wow. <br /> <br /> I went to the end of the film, moving quickly, and I saw a little more tragedy than expected. Some people compare this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make this mistake. They may share similar purposes, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" was directed by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are between 12 and 18 years old.
