I must admit that I caught him a few times on the USA network. There is just something about the sheer nonsense of this movie that makes me want to watch it when it turns. Yes, you're right about sub-par play, the plot that only a seven-year-old might like, and so on. But I can not help but feel sympathy for some actors. Once again, some of these actors have signed up for the even more atrocious sequel.
