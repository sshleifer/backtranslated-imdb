This film features an o.k. score and a performance not bad by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The opening and ending credits show with most actors and "special effects" that it is a low-budget movie. There is nothing in this film that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror / comedy or low budget movies. Not special for fans of nude scenes or movie buffs. This film is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are not exciting either. If you are curious about what I was and can actually find it, you will realize the truth of the resume in one line.
