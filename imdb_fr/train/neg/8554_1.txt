The film was probably made in 1930 and released in 1931. I guess talking films have a lot of trouble making the transition from the era of silence to silence. Nevertheless, this particular plot of Zane Gray seems to be very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper was probably learning to play. The result is something that would not be acceptable by current standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some actors played well. Unfortunately, the Indians still have the short end in these first westerns. They lived on the land long before the arrival of the white man, but according to a distorted story, they had no right to defend themselves.
