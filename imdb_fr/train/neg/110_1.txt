I have this movie outside the library right now and I have not finished watching it. It's so bad that I'm incredulous. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent at that time, even though she was almost done with "Robin and Marian". It's the worst thing about this appallingly stupid movie. It's only really interesting because it was her last feature film and because of Dorothy Stratten's appearance just before her homicide. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more than idiocy between Gazzara and his friends. Small signals, little bows and signs of assent to a real ball-comedy of which it is the most pale and pale shade. <br /> <br /> Who would believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn lived so magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years ago? The soundtrack of Sinatra's old songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is drawn is too loud and obvious - you do not have to wait for the credits to discover that something has been subtly incorporated in the cine-music of the picture know when the songs have exploded you. <br /> <br /> "Back to typing" means coming back at the same time as going down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburn's classy European woman is all you see from someone who was once an actress and always a star. Here, she even lost her star talent. If a person whose talent continued to grow at the time, such as Ann-Margret, had played the role, she would have had a little life, even with the incredibly bad situations both material and Mongoloid. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a great person, of course, superior to what most movie stars had ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful actors . After this dreadful performance, she then directed with Robert Wagner an atrocious television movie entitled "Love Among Thieves". In "They all laughed", it's as if she still played a role in her fifties. Even much more vain and visibly less intelligent actresses who insisted on doing this, like Lana Turner, were infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner took seriously seriously even when it was bad. Hepburn does not take it seriously, he could not care; even her hair and clothes look sticky. His last good job was "Two for the Road", perhaps his most perfect, if not his best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And this girl who plays the country singer is just disgusting. John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend to this film except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was really pretty. Otherwise, the expression often used by the critic David Thomson, "losing his talent," never made more sense. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra had lost all sexual attraction at that time. So we have two films with Gazarra and Hepburn. - who could ask for something less? The last and pitiful film of Sandra Dee, Lost, 2 years later, a small budget, had more than that. At least Ms. Dee spoke in her own voice; in 1981, Audrey Hepburn's focus seemed just ridiculous; she would then go to the Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn at PBS, and there, her rather irritating accent was walking as she walked through the English gardens with aristocrats or her wax exuded "what I like about more, it's when flowers return to nature! 'as in naturalized daffodils, but in a real fiction movie, it just seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Saying that 'Breakfast at Tiffany' was such a profound and poetic thing with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was surely one of the most beautiful on-screen presences of "My Fair Lady", alongside Garbo in several respects and Delphine Seyrig in "Last Year in Marienbad". And that! And her last role as 'Hap' in the movie Spielberg 'Always' was a bit more of the feminine genre - nerdy, uncaring and stuffy. <br /> <br /> I went to his memorial service at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that included a boys' choir singing the hymn shaker "Simple Gifts". The only thing that was not in the program was the sudden chanting of Hepburn's "Moon River" on the emergency escape in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", which caused a lot of emotion and real tears in the congregation. <br /> <br /> A great lady who was once a beautiful actress (as in "The Nun's Story") and one of the biggest and most beautiful movie stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who has become really bad - it's not all that common. And maybe it's just a great human being who, by making trivial movie performances, still has a mind big enough to want the flaws to be reported without mercy - that all his latest movies contain in abundance . Most of the discussion about Hepburn's misdemeanor concerns "My Fair Lady". But the one who should have had the first actress was "Wait Until Dark", who had played Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as famous as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least quite enough in that respect. After that, all his game went down.
