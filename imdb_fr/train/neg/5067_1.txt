It's pretty simple. Friends is a very basic comedy comedy for teenagers and young adults, with an unsophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that, towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, probably to be able to say that they beat the 9 seasons Seinfeld race. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with a brilliant writing, that Friends had (and I'm very generous here) at most 5 or 6 acceptable seasons, then 4 awful seasons. <br /> <br /> It became a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled character traits that were not very good, so start worsening the hundredth time you saw them. I find it so difficult to understand why people attach so much importance to this situation. It's really awful.
