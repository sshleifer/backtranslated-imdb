If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of the First World War and not the story of the Second World War. Find out what happened during this war, how the soldiers had to live all the time around dead corpses. How many soldiers went crazy, according to what they saw during the First World War, when they called it "shellshocked", now called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of the First World War, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become insensitive to death, not because of his hurt, but simply because it was the only way for him too to face the horrors that surrounded them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film misses so many others do it. Read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie "Path of Glory", the only good film of the First World War ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in this film, the feeling of helplessness and a total devaluation of human life, nothing more than sensors of bullets. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing from this movie, it's really the key point to Germany's understanding. A lost war in which millions and millions of Germans have lost their lives without any real reason. Then comes a total economic collapse following the war. These are the factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty will always create extremism. Unfortunately, this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another piece of shit to throw on the pile. Without real value, there are fictional films based on fictional characters that could give you a better idea of ​​Hitler. They simply added Hitler's name on it for the product to sell more.
