I am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and I also like most of the cheaper ones. The famous director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the least expensive contributions, the most trashiest and the worst in the genre. The films in Fidani's films were generally very weak and, his talent being rather limited, he generally tried to sell the films by adding to the titles of the famous names of western spaghetti such as "Django" of "Sartana". In the particular case of "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" from 1971, he has just taken the title of "Gi첫 La Testa" by Sergio Leone (aka "Duck You Sucker") and added "Hombre". The film can be found under different titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I personally bought it under the name "Adios Companeros", that this film shares with another film Fidani with little near the same cast, "Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari", also titled "Adios Companeros" in the German version. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, it follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement in two rival outlaws led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron's main performance is not very convincing. I also did not find Jack Betts very good in "Butch Cassidy". However, the legend of movie B, Gordon Mitchell, is still worth trying. Although he's probably not a very good actor, I've always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani's films (like "Django and Sartana ... confrontation in the west, "a bit ugly. <br /> <br /> There is one thing very funny and original about" Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre "- the great Klaus Kinski plays a priest! could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this film, I would never have guessed that someone would choose him as a priest. "Kinski is, again, awesome, although he only has little time in front of the screen and that a scene where he breaks a fight is probably the only good scene in this case.Another interesting thing about this movie is that the legendary director and king of the movie Joe D'Amato has does the cinematography. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap film, of poor quality, but nevertheless, there are funny moments. As a Western spaghetti enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, do not pay attention to this movie, or just watch it to see Kinski play a priest. 3/10
