I want so much to give a zero to this piece of WASTE. Unfortunately, there is not one. So I had to give him a 1 to warn you of the awful stupidity of this well-known cartoon imposter! The characters seem to have been drawn by preschoolers, no, wait, I've seen preschoolers do better! I prefer "The Adventures of Flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I probably say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Do you remember this episode of Dexter's Lab when they went karting on this volcano? Yeah, Mister Fellows even took advantage of this idea and failed! They even snatched Shadow Lugia in this episode that parodied Pokemon (he even cashed this franchise!) This character is a cheap scam on Mandark Dexter's laboratory! Mister Fellows must be sued for breaking the law for this shit !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who love Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, you lie to yourself. Do yourself a favor, change channels when this scam tries to dishonor your screen!
