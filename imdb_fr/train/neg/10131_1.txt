Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: "What is the worst film of all time ... realized?" This is Flight of Fury, performed by Steven Seagal and co-written with him. Of course, there are many famous bad movies, but this one takes the cake in the sense that he takes himself so seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a Romanian-made film that shows how much Romania has to go to capture with Bollywood. It also shows how completely helpless and talented Steven Seagal has become. This film is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and you have to squat in the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. (I do not see why) and I suspect that the workers who made the DVD had to wear protective gear and receive regular advice.
