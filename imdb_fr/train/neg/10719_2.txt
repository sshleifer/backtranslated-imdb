I would not say it's totally nil, but if it was not for Netflix, I would not even have it at home. The eccentric president of Steve Martin, a chain of health food stores, falls flat. He's just not funny. He is another member of a long series of SNL scraps who can only find work and prostitute themselves in the next SNL movie. The delivery coach with lisp Elmer Fudd is both funny and original. Amy Poehler is content to follow the same gestures as for a 7-minute sketch of SNL, which is about as funny as SNL lately. The only thing that matters for this movie is that Tina Fey is sweet to the eyes. The end was predictable as soon as you heard that her character could not get pregnant. The subject could have opened up to other humorous attempts, but it seems to be simply simmering, not entertaining or making people laugh.
