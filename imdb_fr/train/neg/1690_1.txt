this movie was horrible. I could hardly stay awake through that. I would never see this movie again if I was paid. The scenes called horror were incredibly predictable and played to excess. There was really nothing in this movie that made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Do not go see it, do not rent it, do not read it online because it would be a waste of time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a dull performance and should really be ashamed of herself for tarnishing her reputation with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie. Horrible movie, no need to see it.
