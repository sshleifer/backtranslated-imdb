I'm so glad I did not spend money on going to the cinema :-) This is nothing more than a compilation of elements of some other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc., framed in a rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can not understand what was the purpose of the creation of this film - he has absolutely nothing new to offer in his scenario, which is also insane. Plus, there's nothing to watch - the FX 'seems to have been caught in a second-hand shop, you've usually seen them all in other movies. But it's really a good lullaby.
