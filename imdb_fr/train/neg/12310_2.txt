Steve Martin should stop trying to make remakes of classic comedy. It does not fit this part at all. Like the dismal remake of Out Of Towners, this film falls flat. How anyone ever thought that Steve Martin could even get close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same goes for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have better played the role of Bilko. Martin is great when he makes his own original characters, but he fails miserably trying to recreate the classic work of others. This is a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits at the end of the film. The phrase "Producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation from the US military" was pretty much the only one that made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I put this film in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho. None of them should ever have arrived.
