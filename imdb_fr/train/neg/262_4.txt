Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I have the feeling that he was sold in order to get his first major role in a big budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents spoiled by stereotypical producers who think that black men who commit pretty crimes are a fun concept (see: Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Okay, I laughed a few times and I allowed all these actors to continue playing hilarious roles, but I would like to see these guys diversify in the image of the portrait of Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or, Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans of In Living Color play moving roles in Spike Lee's Bamboozled satire.
