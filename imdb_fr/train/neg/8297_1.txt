Ugh! Where to start? First, Campbell Scott's non-stop agony becomes a real distress after a while (very little time) as he integrates his growing anguish, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters, as presented by the writer and the director, are totally incompatible, and that's where the key lies. They gave us nothing to let us know if they are adulterous and if they are still in love with each other. When Scott said softly to his wife, "I could kill you" in front of their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly mixed timing, I almost wished he had it - and then did the same thing for the mocking, wisecracking appearance of Denis Leary before being removed from the looney bin. A total waste of time and perhaps - perhaps only - resources.
