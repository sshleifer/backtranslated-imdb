I first liked this movie. It seemed like a beautiful comedy with idiotic moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! The same as the wonderful decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the writers have extremely disappointed me. The best end would be the stage on the ladder, but instead, they decided that the father and daughter should be together. I do not like the end. The father becomes the boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows it and finds it well. It would be nice, if the scriptwriters, for example, said that there was now a different soul in the body, but that is not the case, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some moments ruin even the feeling of playing well. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband had been waiting for 23 years (it's long!), She was faithful to him, she loved no one but him and she met about making love to him, after a scene with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she easily betrayed the man she wanted so many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end and a part of the failed human psychology.
