This is an informative film well done in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already made this piece and managed to get L. Paul Bremer to tell his version of the story. Even more troubling is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former think tank wonk - was a supporter of the war until the occupation disappeared to the south. What did he think he was going to happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went as smoothly as it was spoiled by the Nazis. This is what this film suggests: excuses for the occupation rather than the deconstruction of the act of war itself. . <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better managed - as if any war could be better.
