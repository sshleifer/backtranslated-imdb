** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government continued the development of the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and may suffer more damage than before. Despite the downsizing of the government, the endangerment of the project and the supercomputer in the middle feel threatened, it is taking steps to ensure its own safety. He activates and controls UniSols and starts Mayhem. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This film is about something. Choreographed fights. The story is bad and drowns quickly in all fights. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun to watch a fight where one of the parties is indestructible. Normally, you are almost sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the fights are between two roughly equal fighters. No where one is indestructible and can not lose. Then, the fights become simply a tool to stretch the time. You wait for the last fight so that Deveraux miraculously finds a way to defeat his unbeatable opponents. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and certain sign of a bad movie is how many women are lightly dressed. Well, they are not so numerous because the characters are mostly men (there is at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown with at least one bra once. Women leaders do well with this, but we also go through a striptease club (without using a computer) with many more women undressed. These moments give nothing to the story and are just there to try to please the male audience as a teenager. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, boring fights. No more no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
