Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... "protective" treasurer, whatever that means) who comes from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had the opportunity to discover an immense treasure that our founding fathers, most if not all Masons, decided to hide because they simply did not want to finance their independence. <br /> <br /> The first clue turns out to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, made up of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and some faceless lackeys, enter the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately pour tons of gunpowder on the ground, without it being significant in any way. Finally, they find the clue (a skeleton hovers over it) and it turns out that it is a pipe with writing ... on it. Kind of. Do not ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> It's an enigma, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly angry at not finding the real treasure, Gates roams about the meaning of the riddle, in this cargo hold frozen, while the crew stays up, speechless. I mean, come on. Someone should have expressed his disappointment at not finding anything interesting in the damn Arctic, but Gates enters his own world and solves the riddle. <br /> <br /> The following index turns out to be on the declaration of independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is dismayed. Different characters deliver a very obvious exposure (getting used to it). All this leads Ian's lackey to shoot a gun at Gates and the gunpowder explodes in a big explosion. (Oh, that's why they poured out all the gunpowder!) Hein!) Ian and his henchmen run away, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk 15 km at sub-zero temperatures to an Inuit village so to stop them. <br /> <To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and super archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley have to steal it themselves. Riley then explains to Gates with excruciating details why they can not steal the statement because she is so protected by metal and laser eyes and by the high-tech safety blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that it's possible to steal it from the conservation room. Does Riley know what the conservation room is, asks Gates? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" I am not joking; it's the real line. Bartha does not deliver it either as a joke. So, Riley does all this research on the Library of Congress and the Archives and on the water and sewers, but does not know what the preservation room is. This indicates at what level this script is. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short film, Gates actually takes off with the D of I, in a ridiculous break that could only happen in a film. (I also hate the way they describe the technology of computer screens in movies - full of improbable and impractical fonts and graphics.) Abigail Chase ends up identifying herself for convenience and as an obvious angle. " of love ". At one point, all three, fleeing the law, talk very hard about their plans in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father, portrayed by a dyspeptic Jon Voight, brings the good guys and the bad guys to a huge Indiana Jones entertainment hall under the city of New York . Odd that the subway builders have never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior leads Ian to pursue wild goose. Ian thinks they are stuck in a stalemate and leaving them there. However, after they leave, Riley asks them how they are going to go out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... press a button and a door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, as on a sink in an office building. Fortunately he knew where it was. Anyway, after a little more discomfort, they find this huge treasure room (remember, it's all under Manhattan!) Is full of all kinds of historical gold stuff. Riley arrives to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And the FBI agent, Harvey Keitel, forgives them, stops Sean Bean and allows the two chemistry-free sons to get married. <br /> <br /> For any spectator, I think it would be difficult to ignore all the exposure, the jumps. of logic, and stereotyped characters for a very long time. Although some of his presentations have beautiful story lessons inserted into the conversation at random times. I would like more conversations like this in my life.
