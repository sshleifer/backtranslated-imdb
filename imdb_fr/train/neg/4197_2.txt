Incredibly bad acting, a story not good, not clear, showy images and slow where it is needed the least: adrenaline is all that a film should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (so-called) Dutch soap actress who did not take her English lessons) plays the rich girl Freya, who is used to "looking for thrills". This basically consists of doing dangerous stunts, breaking things and annoying people. And not funny, Jackass. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He is a little ahead of the pack but has other illegal activities. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And in the end we have Jason (the newbie Fyall), Freya's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya is gone and everyone seems involved, but we, the viewer, do not really care about the casting is either friendly or believable, and the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? 2/10.
