Guy Ritchie's noble endeavor consists of hitting, stunning, raping, kicking, shooting, stabbing, spitting, punching, sodomizing and mistreating and leaving for death by Madonna's terrible performance. Her playing was reminiscent of a graduate of Al Gore School of Drama and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie made a noble attempt to redo this, and if you exclude ALL of his wife's scenes, it's a fair movie, at best. I think the best acting job of all time was to reassure his wife that her performance was good enough not to start over. If you have the option to watch Swept Away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes ... opt for extended pedicure.
