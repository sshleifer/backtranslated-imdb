What a bad movie !!! I can not believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious and amateurish excuse for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, stunned by the direction and the camera work of this movie! And read worshipers who say there is truth and reality in this film when it is actually a brazen attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of critics and festivals by making them cheap and creepy. <br /> <br /> At least, this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Film Festival has become a complete joke and that the show presented here is more of a bad movie etiquette than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You will want your time back! I know I did.
