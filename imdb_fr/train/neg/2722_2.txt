For the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is an incoherent and insolent French film that gives a bad name to "art films". The story tells the story of a bitter old man, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who is looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti. They did. In the absence of a coherent scenario, the film loses us quickly, although I am quite willing to admit that there may be someone who actually receives a deep message from this film. <br /> <br /> This confusing and snarled drama lasts two hours and five minutes - though I doubt very much anyone with any life will be able to hang around by the closing credits.
