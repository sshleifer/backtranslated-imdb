This film had mediocrity, laziness and carelessness. If you're going to make a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times, you'd better do a hell of a lot of work. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some horror / horror movies simply fail to break the mold of "lets do something forbidden and surrender for fun, because all stories are just lies". This one, unfortunately, was no different, and like all horror movies, once you venture down this path, you can not go back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes do the same job again and again throughout the movie, then mysteriously they get bogged down in the moment and can not do the work in the end? The end was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 that I will never look at. Terrible film.
