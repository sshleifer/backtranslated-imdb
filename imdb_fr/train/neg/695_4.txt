I've heard so much about this movie how much it was a big slasher and one of those early 80s movies that die, the hardcore fans of most slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I must say that, even though it caught my attention, most of the slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night" caught the attention , this film could have been true up there, it lacked only the enthusiasm and the potential of the characters, as well as the current history. The characters that I found were unfortunate in this film: the weird guy with frizzy hair slipping around the dormitory and of course leading to his true climatic role at the end, facing the killer. Another guy would be the dirty-looking, scruffy guy with the denim jacket. He could have played more roles in this film that could have made the film more interesting. Instead, the movie played this guy as another loser who makes unknown calls while sleeping with his girlfriend and then drops his share and cuts it to the end which was a mess, I I was disappointed on his part at the end. Regarding the true identity of the murderer, when the identity was unveiled, I laughed, but it was too obvious and he really made a real jolt of himself as well as a boring character after his true intentions have been revealed. This film should be a movie to watch at least once for all slasher fans, but do not spend your hard-earned money in stocks of rare and hard-to-find collectors.
