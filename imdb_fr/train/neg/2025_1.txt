My wife and I are half-amused by the Howie Mandel show. I also like Shatner - even if he is the most pathetic. <br /> <br /> But it's absolutely the worst TV show. <br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks a **. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is that the girls are hotter than ever and they wear less clothes than Deal or no Deal ... <br /> <br> /> The questions are a mixture of far too easy and incredibly obscure. And watching Shatner or the competitor say "Show me money" makes me want to throw up .. This one will not last.
