Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one of the secrets of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers what is horrible to wait behind the door to get them. If the door finally opens and an insect three meters high passes through the reader, he may be a little scared, but he will also say, "I can deal with it. At least it was not 100 feet tall. . "Nothing is more frightening than what is hidden, invisible and unknown, just on the other side of this tightly closed door, waiting to get you. <br /> <br /> THE HAUNTING is so completely misunderstood that the director Jan De Bont has more or less his film begins metaphorically by opening this door himself and shouting: "Look, everyone, look! It's an insect ten feet tall! Is not it SCARY ?! "The law of diminishing returns immediately comes into play. At the end of the film, the director is somehow jumping up and down, banging his pans and saucepans so great, and screaming hoarsely: ten hundred-foot animals! ... And now, here are a hundred insects of THOUSAND feet! "<br /> <br /> Filmmakers apparently believed that special effects could they alone compensate for all the other shortcomings of this enterprise (and they are numerous). They can not and do not. In fact, as impressive as they are, the special effects are so insistent and overwhelming that the bewildered viewer ends up watching them - whether in admiration or annoyance - instead of being immersed in a story. <br /> <br /> For me, the nadir of the sheer stupidity of this movie comes when a statue, with "blood" gushing out of its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) in a fountain. The filmmakers obviously did not know what to do with this so-called idea once they had it, so they just whipped Neeson into the water, waving his arms and glutinous. At the next scene, the good doctor apparently dried up and forgot about boredom. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been incorporated into this ridiculous scenario by a committee. Low-IQ teenagers who thought that the way to scare people was to make each effect louder and louder: "Okay, then let's make the ceiling look like a terrifying face and come down on it ... and all those pungent things, like, trapping her in bed. "<br /> <br /> The only thing that saves THE HAUNTING is that it finally gets so awful that it's really funny. At the moment when Owen Wilson (under the name of Luke Sanderson) fell to the ground and then left for his Magic-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I fell on the ground laughing myself. <br /> <br /> Badly built, without intelligence Grotesque with heavy hands, quite incredible, and filled with clumsy dialogues and empty scenes, this empty HAUNTING is a classic example of how it is forbidden to make a horror movie.
