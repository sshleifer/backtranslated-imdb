One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it becomes a satire, is that it is somewhat plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do a lot more damage than it was intended for. But I'll leave that to physicists who may have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> This is a crisis the Earth is facing because solar flares are becoming uncontrollable. They are getting closer to the Earth, so hot that it is extremely hot, as if the whole Earth was the Valley of Death. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that a spacecraft will have to bring to the sun and blow it up there. This will deflect flares in, for example, the direction of Mercury, provided that it is not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who will provide it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is to say if he can keep the spirit in the case and not in his son on the run, Corin Nemec. Admiral Charlton Heston, father of Matheson and grandfather of Nemec, deals with the personal aspect of family problems. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain, Peter Boyle, CEO of a multinational corporation that in this crisis is trying to control the global food supply of survivors. The idea that he might not survive does not enter his thoughts. He is doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems to be a bad mix of 2001, an odyssey of space and a trip to the bottom of the oceans. Boyle seems to be inspired by Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman. Apparently, he is the only one in the cast to realize that he is in a turkey and acting excessively. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is faithful, true blue and dull. Except perhaps the desert rat, Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film was directed by the famous Hollywood flopped film provider, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was released in time for a Thanksgiving sculpture.
