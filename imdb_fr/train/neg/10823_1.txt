I do not like to use the word "horrible" to describe a film work that requires a lot of time, effort, talent and money, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel, "Jane Eyre ", is a total loss of time. <br /> <br /> The text lacks finesse and power, everything is explained to the viewer in clear terms, leaving little to the imagination. The main actors are unfortunately badly engaged, clearly hired for their names of stars, and the musical score is slow and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other. She's like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of a minimum of emotional involvement in what should be a frustrated passion story. And William Hurt plays the whole movie in a tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course, the flabby and tasteless scenario does not help any of these remarkable actors in their efforts to give life to this film. <br /> <br /> Mrs Fairfax by Joan Plowright is like a Disney creation that keeps popping up. to soften the scenes in which she would have been better left out. <br /> <br /> The story of Rochester's first wife is not a mystery. The role of the so-called second wife, interpreted as a Barbie doll by Elle MacPhearson, is a numerical figure. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely lost as Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed. She would have been better interpreted than Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved teacher, evokes genuine sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of "Jane Eyre" after watching Robert Young for British television, directed in 1997, with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. The vital, romantic and deeply moving version of Young looks like an explosive nova compared to Zefferelli's wet primer. <br /> <br /> I will be interested to see now the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I read very good things on this web site. I'm amazed how many people liked Zefferelli's picture book in Yorkshire. <br /> <br /> All I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography very colorful, beyond, it's a complete failure.
