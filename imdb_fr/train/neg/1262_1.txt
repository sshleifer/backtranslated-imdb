This film has a weak plot, a weak characterization and really weak special effects. I wonder why I lost a precious life by watching him. There are random characters who add nothing to the story and who seem to be excuses for the director to get his girlfriend into the movie. The robots are sad and the main "hero" is activated by a huge knife switch. If this movie was not so bad, it would be laughable, but it's not funny. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed. It's sad when you think you're the bad guy, because he's the best to cheer. In the end, it was better to leave this film in the editing room or never to finance it.
