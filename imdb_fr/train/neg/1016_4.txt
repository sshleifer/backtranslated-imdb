The film itself is not too bad; many comments have highlighted the obvious flaws of the script, but this one is observable. What really makes me panic is that people like Justin Timberlake are even screened for movies, and more for movies like this one. I must admit that I had never heard the man's name before looking at it, but the very moment he appeared, I was just pissed off. The voice is shit, the face is a bad scam Legolas, the posture is horrible and he can not even coordinate correctly the three. He said I was thrilled when he was jumped out of the disco because I was hoping it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two people, as well as LL Cool J, give a very decent performance. This is the main reason why I give a 4. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of upcoming movies with Timberlake's little cast ... and can not believe it. .
