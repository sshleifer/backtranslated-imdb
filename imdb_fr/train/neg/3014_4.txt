I recently watched Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I am both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. Although I think the movie does a good job of getting the message across, I could not help thinking that it was created after the fact for Burtynsky's photos and popular book. Obviously, one of the reasons is the intensive use of still photographs with zooms and panoramas. Although this is a good effect for economical use, I thought that 75% of the film was still images of Burtynsky's book (which I already had). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's what I felt. If you own the book or know his work, it's better to skip it.
