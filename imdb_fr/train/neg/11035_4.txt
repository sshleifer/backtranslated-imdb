It's the most saccharine romance I've attended. The perfect film for an idle housewife in a handkerchief, a housewife and high-heeled ostrich mules watching in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating sweets. In fact, sweets play a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could look to the end was that I was finally able to look at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. . In most of his films, he moves too fast to be seen. The only fast action of this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with a Latin emotion - more Italian than Mexican, really. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodice is torn - the hero is unsightly, with perfect maneuverability and a soft tone. The aristocratic clich√© of the warm-blooded old-world family is as old as the hills. What does it matter whether it's Irish, Italian or Mexican? It's a fairy story. <br /> <br /> I knew before the end of the current game that it would not be the movie I was hoping for. The bright grapes resembled the paragon of all the commercials in Women's Day magazine. I did not see his name inscribed, but the art director was surely Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million dollar paintings of Irish cottages huddled in fuchsias. This film was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like dreamy blue and pink skies, this movie is for you! (The candies looked really good too!)
