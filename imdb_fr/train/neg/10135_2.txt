I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me review a few points that I think could have been improved. acting, writing, staging, special effects, film crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea what had to do with the film. Apparently, in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Nowadays, these things cost about $ 3 billion and can not become invisible. Apparently, you can fly from the United States to the Middle East in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, it did not bother me, but it was like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera would zoom randomly on the actors and move on to random scenes. Oh yes, since it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable like hell. Overall, I rank it first with Snakes on Plane.
