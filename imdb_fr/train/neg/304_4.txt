This film depicts Ruth as a sporty woman, who drinks hard, plays excessively, plays with a little baseball. The beginning of Babe Ruth's life was very interesting and for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. Moreover, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and it was a well-known relationship, good or bad, she should have been better covered than she was. His life was more than anything bad. He was an American hero, an icon that inspired many great baseball players. I think I'm just in memory of a great baseball player that this movie completely ignored. Shame on the directors of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not on his greatness.
