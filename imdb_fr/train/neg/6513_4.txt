I would rather have 20 root canals than see this movie again. The boring prince, Myles Berkowitz, has lost nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. The only funny thing in all this mess is Mr. Samaha's unpleasant behavior against the breasts and ass. Berkowitz adopts an excellent concept and reduces it to dust. He is jerky and poorly done, in an apparent effort to make him look edgy or funny. This is neither. I rarely feel that a film is a loss of film (or tape), but this one deserves this distinction. If a date suggests to see this movie, launch.
