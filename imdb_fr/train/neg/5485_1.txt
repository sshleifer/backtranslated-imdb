Without reiterating what was said above about this film, I would like to add that I was eager to see this film ... the cast / filming and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom, etc. There was a vague shadow of "Do not look now" about the story from the beginning. A stay in different environments (still Italy) to mitigate the grief of the loss ... or maybe that's how I saw it? As a result, I sat waiting for the story to unfold and to give an idea of ​​what we expected from this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there and sat down .. and guess what? nothing really happens! and I mean nothing !! We do not even give you the chance to enter the characters because they are so dimensional and vacant .. You are led to believe, to believe the rhythm of the film, that something was going to happen that would upset the whole film .. The older girls flirting with the boys from the local vespa, were likely to turn the film in another direction; I felt ridiculous considering his age. It seemed that the scenario was the subject of a last reminder, where they had decided at the last minute to eradicate all the courage of history and to reduce it to a minimum, if not zero. When the credits start rolling (unexpectedly), you can not help but waste your time looking at this pile of garbage.
