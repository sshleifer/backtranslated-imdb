I watched this film after much enjoying Gregory's daughter many years ago. It was drivel. The plot was vaguely unpleasant with the teacher and his friend who perverts girls from 14 to 15 years dressed in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think it does not matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children in school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher is coveting his students. We were surprised that the censor lets this pass. Apart from that, the movie was a waste of time. The screenplay was poor and John Gordon Sinclair was trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly quirky and quirky. Why someone would like to covet him in this performance is incredible. This film failed on all counts for me. Horrible. Please do not waste your time watching it. Life is too short
