I watched this film during a preview screening and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. He is full of dick jokes and farting and takes no pride in action sequences (like shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a list of things that I liked in the movie ... and many things I did not agree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The pet jokes. 3. Shit jokes. 4. The guy was a cat. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Once again make fun of Bush .. WE GET IT, IT IS AN IDIOT .. go ahead. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. The killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was inside. 12. Most of the actors were just insults. <br /> <br /> Now, the best (some) <br /> <br /> 1. The Dude uses a cat as a silent as in the game. 2. A lot of action. 3. Crotchy made a comeback (and a postal maker cameo)) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for that. 5. There are some moments "what's new" <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He made another shitty game in the movie adaptation. Congratulations to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
