When I saw the film in the cinema, I saw the film so badly that it became the product of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were awful. The scenario was ridiculous. Actor play can not really be called an actor. The only reason I remember the name so well is that my family is still telling how bad it really was.
