I noted a few notes here on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips', satanic serial killer of 1990, Yuppie Hell-Fest ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently put in charge for beating his wife and his wife. can serve a prison sentence. I only hope he can find the clothes of the Armani prison with elegance: one of the guilty pleasures of this film is to see his police detective dressed in over $ 4500, a $ 7300 silk suit and see his $ 3,500 / month Los Angeles mans Van Der Roeh, bachelor mistress, with an interior decor. <br /> <br /> 2) The main woman Tracey Phillips has a beautiful porcelain skin, a red hair that always looks elegant, even when it is dirty, and amazing breasts illuminated in the second half of the film by a sweater in designer silk that unfortunately remains in place on her torso even when she was ready to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic killers undressed their victims before eliminating them, although there is something to say to leave a little to the imagination. In the last 10 minutes of the movie, all I could think of was what her breasts might look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychics living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a point of view that would prompt Brad Pitt to decide he was in The time length. In fact, the condominium used in this film has exactly the same model as that of MULLHOLLAND DR., By David Lynch, who at least had the good sense to make this condo resident a successful movie director. The only professional psychics I've met outside of this film are currently serving a prison sentence for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forget his name, but the villain in this film is wonderful and his "How are you?" ", My friend?" line could be the most neglected phrase of the movie since "THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY !!" from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under big metropolitan cities, there are huge pots of simmering acid that will explode in huge fireballs if someone throws a lit Zippo lighter, c that is why the big water treatment plants have no signs of smoking covering them, although the idea of ​​smoking at the edge of the water is dangerous is of course absurd. And since Zippo lighters need to be manually filled with a lighter fluid that can often leak and be absorbed by your clothes, the thought of carrying them in the pocket of your $ 7,300 Gucci silk suit seems much more dangerous to me. <BR /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are impressive, to say the least, and one of the fun things to watch is to let you see that you're not watching computer-assisted special effects, but that Stuntmen are risking their lives to contribute to a film that has received almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when it was released. <br /> <br /> 7) Satanists still amaze me: here is a guy who took advantage of a Luciferian offer for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful , like getting rich or getting models to have sex with him, he has ladies bag and levitates them outside the apartments. Speaking of what is here a guy who is indestructible, can fly, and is able to put his being in the bodies of other people - and yet, he forces star Lou Diamond Phillips with a fight at the ordinary hair in the conclusion of the film, yet does not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And so on ... To watch with friends who creak while drinking beer. You will have fun as long as you firmly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
