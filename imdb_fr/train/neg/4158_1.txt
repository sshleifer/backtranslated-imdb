This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie as bad as this one !!! <br /> <br /> AND I NEVER MEAN !!!! <br /> <br /> I am a BIG fan of horror movies "B". As you can imagine, I have been exposed to some of the worst that the film industry can offer. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by this title. I mean go ... what real horror fan would not be intrigued by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? The images of the "undead" fighting for the "undead" danced in my head. I thought ... "I have to see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... sorry to say it .... "I wish I did not see it" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting the zombies. In fact, there is no conspiracy !!!! If you asked me what this film is, I could honestly tell you that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no conspiracy !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no sense !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money in this project because they surely have no sense of business !!!
