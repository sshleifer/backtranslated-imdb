It almost looks like two movies - one literate and engaging, the other stupid and clich√©. It's a shame that not all writing problems have been solved, but given the speed with which most B-movies have been written and produced, it's not that unusual. It's a shame, because it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First the good. The film is original and involves code breakers from the Second World War. It's quite fascinating and I liked watching the ruler (Lee Bowman) prove himself as a code breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie were very good. But for the worse, the film stayed too long and lost its breath after about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a "girlfriend" must be considered one of the least well-written and embarrassing roles in the history of cinema! For every intelligent move made by Bowman, the fool Rogers then stepped in to spoil everything as a sort of misguided "comic relief." If his role had been intelligently written, the whole film would have improved a lot! Instead of looking at it, it's hard to understand how we won the Second World War !!
