The fast pace of this film numbs us against the shocks it could cause us. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were tasteless. The Irish priest was as lame as the amorous interest. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose to offer the sensuality of the film could be better. The central conflict of the main character was not involved. This film is entirely devoid of positive points. It's like a tedious exercise on the part of someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but who did it anyway.
