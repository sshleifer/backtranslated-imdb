The film begins in 1840 in Japan in which a man strikes his wife and her lover to death and commits suicide. It's a bloody and bloody sequence. Then it jumps to the present day ... finally 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), his wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little child settle in Japan for their husband's work. They rent a house and - surprise! surprise - this is the house where the murders took place! The three dead are ghosts (makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> It sounds ok - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between. There is a giant crab attack that is simply scary! They look so wrong - I swear I saw the strings pull one - and they mumble !!!!! There is a useless sexual sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another sequence about 40 minutes later (but this was necessary for the plot) and a really stupid exorcism towards the end. You have to see the fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Albert was fine, her husband and McClure being pretty good friends of the family. But George - as always - is great in a lousy movie. She gives this film a much needed boost - but can not save it. I give her a 2 just for her and the bloody opening and closing. This aside, it's a very boring movie.
