One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. Karloff dying (who is about 120 years older than he is) is essentially a scientist who needs money to complete his experiments before he dies. Coming from Morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to the south of France where he works as a doctor while trying to put enough money aside to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the rich young wife of a dying cotton baron. She will finance him if he helps her to poison the husband so that she can take his money and continue with a gigolo (who, I think, is married). If you think I misunderstood that by watching the movie, I had to read what other people had posted to find out what had happened. Why? because this film had misled me after two minutes. I did not know what was going on with his many characters and multiple converging intrigues. Few things are explained and we do not say much before the end, time that I did not care. It's a disaster of interest purely for Karloff's performance which is sometimes quite strange. To be honest, this is the only time I've ever seen him venture into the strange territory of Bela Lugosi. It's not all the scenes but a few and I wonder how much they dragged on.
