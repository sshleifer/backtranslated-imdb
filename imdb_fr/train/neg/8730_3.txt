What strikes me (unfortunately) in this film is the introduction, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) drives into town. You see his Mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its redwoods. It's pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin, well ... Andy is too Hispanic / Latin to make it passable. Maybe a white father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of farmers and sticks, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that gets louder when he gets upset. Yeah, I know, do not worry? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title is about a serial killer who nicknamed her victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind and he dismounts them. The killer paused, but suddenly resurfaced when a blind witness (do not ask), Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman), appears. Thurman does a good job playing a blind man, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen play Sgt. Freddy Ross I worried. Henriksen has been playing in rather strange films, especially lately. I still can not forget it in the bloodbath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin films in a small town of L.A. as a detective. He begins investigating Jennifer's murders after discovering body remains in the local garbage dump. His talent for discovering that one of the victims was blind seemed far-fetched. The irony of the murder of * SPOILER * Freddy did the same, with the recording and the similarities of names. I became very confused about the logic of creating eight "Jennifers". And the motive of the killer, simply disturbed, does not have much value. In retrospect, this movie is probably more faithful to reality by showing an unsuspecting individual capable of murder simply because he has become a little crazy over time or maybe were born crazy tooney. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a remarkable job. in his interrogation of Garcia! Even if no police officer would be legally allowed to exert such pressure on someone and force him to do so without being knocked out. As for the end, it's a bit of a surprise, but it's very questionable, like the Sgt. The murder of Ross. The killer chooses to walk after his victim while running, opting for frolick, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And he has so many opportunities to kill her that it's ridiculous. I will not spoil the end because despite the tremors, it's a good surprise. Then you will probably say, as I did, "was my boy lucky!" 4/10
