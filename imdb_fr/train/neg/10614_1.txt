It's the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. It's an art film, but it's really waste. The quality of the tango dance is a redeeming quality, but that does not make up for Sally Potter's flagrant and disgusting homage to herself. The plot of this movie is nonexistent, and I guarantee you that you will start laughing by the end. Especially where she begins to sing. It's absolutely unreal.
