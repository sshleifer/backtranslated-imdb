There are two types of 1950s musicals. First you have the glossy MGM productions with big names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a lesser-known cast, lesser-known music and second-rate directors. "The girl can not help it" belongs to this last category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, never mind. It looks like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razor blade and one can not help but think that it is mainly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other acts of rock from the 1950s that appear in the film. If you're interested in this music, it's worth watching. Otherwise, do not bother.
