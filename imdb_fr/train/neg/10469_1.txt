Yes I admit to having cried during this film. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not help crying. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First with the Million Dollar Man program (now a professional wrestler), and now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a series of unspecific films focused on religion. It was quite amusing, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so inaccurately biblically. The film follows what is called "Bible code" rather than following the scriptures. This film is extremely poorly done; from his writing to his realization to his horrific hilarious play. It is depressing to see people making efforts in this film. It sounded more like a late-night movie than someone watching on the American channel or a video directly at home than a movie released in theaters. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you do not watch this movie, even if you are deprived of life. depended on that.
