The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst film I've seen so far. I did not think it was possible to be at the top of my list of bad B movies, but this one deserves gold. It's not funny. It's bad to act, it's bad filmed and the scenario is bad. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that there are three girls. I really believe that this film has the potential to bring the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish film ever! And it's really something. Congratulations in advance!
