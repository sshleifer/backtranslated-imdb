What was she thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a future cop who teams up with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. The direct quirkiness is embarrassing and ridiculous, an ambitious concept in search of itself. It was apparently a work of love for his screenwriter-director, Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end results are anemic, charitable. Goldberg's mere onscreen presence can often bring goodwill and laughter, no matter how poorly the screenplay is, but here she drowns and you can see the result. NO STARS of ****
