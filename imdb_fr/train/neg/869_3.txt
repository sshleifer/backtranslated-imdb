Where to begin ... If this movie had been a black comedy, I'd say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and for all those who have free time and of which there is only a little money left (note that it is the price that I paid, that I had it at Wal-Mart), this movie had to be a thriller. The only thing that made me shiver was to look at Kirkland's unhealthy interpretation of Anne Wilkes in Misery without snowy woodland. If you want to laugh on a rainy Friday night with friends, I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least halfway, then do not even worry. <br /> <br /> For my part, I enjoy shabby movies, the worst is the best in most cases. But wow ... I meant wow !! The only person in the whole film that has not worsened is the little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even gave him 3 stars is because he gave me something to do.
