Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read on the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or who reign with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not portray any of these things. What we show is a propaganda document with a lot of finger and flutter. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and the period, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is sorely lacking. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who wants to see how to romance or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant news, then look good. I just found this one a little mediocre. Just the opinion of a man though. <br /> <br /> The remake is a notch below but not much.
