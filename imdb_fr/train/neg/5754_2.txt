I watched a mask in the 80s and it is currently airing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking it was pretty cool during the day and that I had some toys too, but watching it bored me now. I had never realized before how much this series of cartoons was boring and bland. It's just awful! It's not at all in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was quickly forgotten by almost everyone once it was stopped. I only watch it on Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 arrives right after (ie if the mask does not kill me first). One of the cartoons of the 80s that I hope to forget once more when it will be broadcast on Fox Kids!
