I really have trouble rating this movie. It's brilliantly managed, there's obviously a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (although his on-screen personality can be a little more precise and more piquant), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it's one of those really unhealthy movies where you can not help wondering if the director himself likes to shoot certain scenes, and yes, we can not help wondering how many imitators such a film will inspire. /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to wonder who these people are giving their money for producing such a movie ....
