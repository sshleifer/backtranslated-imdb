I really like slasher movies, but this one is really awful. The acting is lame, the scenario is bad and the atmosphere is non-existent. The plot is this: a poorly trained gardener, Charlie Puckett, kills people in a small American town. That's right, it's the plot. Very original, huh! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not even bloody enough - if the movie will not scare, at least they should make it bloody.Avoid this cheap trash If you want to see good slasher movies, take a look at " Madman "," The Burning "," The Prowler "," Just Before Dawn "or" Humongous "- do not waste your precious time with this trashy trash.
