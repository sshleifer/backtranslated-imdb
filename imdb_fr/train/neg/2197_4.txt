He returns at the time of the morning, when children having nowhere to walk took their appointment on the balcony after emptying their younger brothers and sisters. It did not matter what was on the screen - the little children were looking at it and the big boys did not know it. Adults, of course, would never see him. <br /> <br /> But they put it on video, anyway, with most of the other grumpy "B" horror movies at the low budget of the golden age of television. The inherent and unintentional humor of this film is derived from an obsolete ideology (the "bad girls" harvested to replace the crushed body of poor Jan - they had come), from an overused plot (a mad scientist , trying to play God), a violent and conscientious monster (whose presence in the rural laboratory of the scientist, the normal appearance, is never fully explained) and whose game is polarized between the wood and the top. <br /> <br /> It's a movie of a big party, provided that your guests take advantage of adding dialogues and comments to otherwise horrendous cinematic feats. In fact, if you or your guests prefer a more passive entertainment, this film is also available in video as part of its treatment "Mystery Science Theater 3000", in which the host and puppets of the cult television series make the additions required.
