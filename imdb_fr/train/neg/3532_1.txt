It's as if you take the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, remove their style and class and mix them up with a lot of pretentious new wave "I'm an intellectual, so my film has to be hard to understand" movie of manufacturer garbage, crushed in a few extra styles for good measure, cut the end, that's Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a little after watching, and yes that's nice of sense, but that does not stop it from being a waste. <br /> <br /> A waste of money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> Up there, the worst film I've ever seen, without even having a bad novelty value for the film, in order to redeem it a bit.
