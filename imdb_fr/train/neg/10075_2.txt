I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed could not save this sequel. I went through half of the movie thinking it was a parody of the original. Then came this wild and wacky motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie directed by Patricia Birch); and I unfortunately realized that they were trying to be serious. The opposing group, having lost their "wheels" because of their playing habits in the original version of Grease, fell in love with the second film. Being ashamed of this character Carrington, I hate to see what they would use later: maybe mopeds? <br /> <br /> I never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-australian-boy-can not- fit-in-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-go-for-hard-guys-with- stupid biker-look headset. It was a Disney story that went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> It looks like you CAN spoil a good thing by placing a chewing gum slamming Michelle Pfeiffer into a musical. The only thing I removed from this film was an idea of ​​the number of points to be awarded out of ten.
