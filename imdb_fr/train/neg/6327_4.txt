I thought this movie would be a lot better than it was. It sounded like a spoof on the part of the spy general, and his debut reminded me of Pleasantvil, but that film was short. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up a spying school to teach their spies to behave like Americans, but the city they created for their training is a little outdated. up. I do not know, but it just seems to be there. It really becomes strange when no one in this Russian city speaks with a Russian accent. Someone has messed up in the casting. <br /> <br /> In addition, for a comedy, it is painfully dry. There are one, two fun spots in the head, and they are nothing to sing and dance The movie will probably end up falling asleep. <br /> <br /> And, like a twisted punch in the face, this movie is so much for the United States that it makes me sick. The film keeps repeating that the United States is God and that Russia is the devil. This is the kind of defamation campaign that was waged against the Japanese during the Second World War. It's movies like this that remind everyone that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> and I'm nice. It really should have one, but the dance scene was funny, but again, it dragged on too fast to be really funny.
