I had the displeasure of watching this film with my girlfriend who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie in the bottom right sucked! He missed the magic of the first. You can really understand every word spoken by the mice, the animation is of poor quality, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and that were terrible, fortunately the Prince did not have many lines that kept him from looking stupid. Basically, it's like The Lion King 1 1/2, except its different stories told by the mice. The reason I give it a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.
