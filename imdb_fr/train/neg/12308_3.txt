Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not stop this film from laying an egg the size of an emu. Based on the classic television series Phil Silvers, he bombed because: A) It was updated in the 1990s and B) The basic premise of the TV series has been turned into a confusing, frivolous and ridiculous scenario. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small group of talented actors to portray lovable characters playing jokes that are both simple and hilarious. Extending this premise in a film from the 1990s was problematic, and it shows. Nobody could pay me enough to sit a second time on this boat.
