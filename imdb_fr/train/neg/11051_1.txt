A terrible film containing a host of Canadian actors on the red list who seem so embarrassed by the fact that they are on camera that their performances are too melodramatic and quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, poorly edited and poorly directed. It's disjointed, incomprehensible and weird - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he has received, but is the only one in this movie to do it - he really has a story and a hard-to-use storyline. It's not even enough camp to be funny. <br /> <br /> I have not yet seen Van Pelleske act credibly, and even sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal and whiny voice) confirm that we are a lot in Toronto rather than a barge off Africa. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the "creature" looked like a jazz dancer in extraterrestrial costume? The fight between blue lightning and Pelleske's orange magic nets (!?! For lack of a better word) is obviously the result of bad actors, without a choreographer, covered with completely derivative special effects. Was there even a director on the set or in the editing room of this catastrophic film (not the kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... Do not waste your time with this one, you will regret it as I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
