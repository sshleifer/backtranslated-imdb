The wicker man has done the impossible! He replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my mind of steel trap. YES it's really so bad. So bad that when I sat down to write this review, I said to myself: "If I had the choice to see this film again or to have me get hot needles", I could perhaps opt for hot needles. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute created a rare film where Joel Schumacher could sit down and say with comfort and guilt free spirit "Yes, it's a wrong direction over there". <br /> <br /> I think the first clue for myself should have been the slogan: "Some sacrifices have to be made". Of course, this may seem like some kind of scary sinister line to intrigue you, but the sacrifice will be on the public side on the screen. Believe me, the people in charge of this film should be charged with a hate crime ... or at least fraud for trying to get this into a show that looks like entertainment. Seriously! The film is about an island where men are only here for breeding and I would rather be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice, and then get stuck there. <br /> <br /> The most fun part about it The movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. It's not a joke or a fiction. I never went to a "thriller" and I heard so many laughs throughout the movie. I can not tell you for sure if the bursts of laughter were intentional in the effort to lighten the cinematographic tension or if they really thought that this crud would actually shatter. In all honesty, I found myself dealing with a power outage or maybe a fight to get out in the movie theater. Anything to make this more interesting, which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the movie just for a little mental anesthesia (soon a law soon before all Nic Cage movies, write to your congressman today, do not delay). At one point, I thought that this movie might be a parody and that Anna Ferris would show up, oh, how I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws so much ham by image that I'm thinking about having a cholesterol test done today. To say that I never thought that Sean Penn was a slacker for slamming Nic's game, oh, he's still a slacker just under a ... yes, Sean Penn's burden has been diminished because of this movie. Do us a favor, Nic, play with your strength and keep on being pathetic losers and drunkards. You can not play Superman if you do not play robust roles, go straight to jail, do not go, do not collect $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally arrives unbalanced and actually hits a sturdy woman to steal his bear costume (like farting, not a joke or a functional moment during this criticism) and then starts running like a lover like Conan O'Brian bear masturbating, but with half the hilarity of a bear hitting his junk food around. Fortunately, it comes to an end soon after it turns out to be a sacrifice for the public during the new hybrid tour of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just announced the end - and if you knew better, you would build worship statues and sing songs from my legend. I sat down during these feasts so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> In the middle of this little mishap, I kept telling myself that Jack Bauer would have finished this business in 20 minutes of real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have known in less than an hour ?? and you, sir, are not an inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If, for any reason, you are taken prisoner and you have the choice to see this movie or take a ball, take the ball. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, Uwe Boll makes fun of us all.
