I am appalled by the gravity of this film. As a pastiche of Hollywood artists of the early twentieth century, it sets a new record - even after The Moderns or Cradle Will Rock (I did not think I would see a movie worse than these). period. Nevertheless, the intentions and results were extremely similar. <br /> <br /> First, there is the horrible cast: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe anything to this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even try to capture the air or the sound of the period they are supposedly describing. <br /> <br /> Well, Last Picture Show was a worthy movie, but it's a disaster. & the rest of Bogdonovitch's photos were not much better. I guess the friction against Welles & Hitch & Ford disappeared a long time ago. Still good for hosting TCM though.
