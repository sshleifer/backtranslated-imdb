What a long film, long and useless. I'm sure historically this film is delicious, but as entertainment, it's just not up to par. Ralph Fiennes played in fantasy films, The English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was so disappointing. It did not seem to be going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so thin and tight that I am surprised that his "sister" never interested her. Do not pay for renting this movie, buy a copy of the English Patient instead.
