Everything in this movie was terrible. For starters, this movie had a very good cast and I find it impossible to make such a big distribution of the biggest gangster disaster. The soundtrack was a very bad comedy slap stick. There was this music throughout the movie and it was getting pretty irritating. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLICER YOURSELF WITH THIS DISASTER, YOU WILL NOT BE INJURED
