"The triumph of love" triumphs over nothing. It is a heavy and heavy torture of 4 hours. In fact, it's been a little less than 2 hours, it seemed a lot longer. It's hard to even think of the amateur performances of such talented comedians as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The support players are not so awful. Maybe they were trying to be so exaggerated to be clownish, but if that was the case, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not feel one way or the other. She (he) is right there. I imagine that the play of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It could not be worse. The writer and director of this film, Clare Peploe, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I do not know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything has been lost in the translation.
