Wow! I watched the trailer of it and even if "no, this one is not for me". I watched the faces of my husband and our friend during the trailer and I knew it was a "boy" movie. I mean, hello! a group of barmaids of dancing chicks - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then, I started to look at it, it did not look so bad. so I kept looking. I watched it all the way. what a great movie. if anything, it's a chick movie. these girls have an attitude. it's really a film of well-being and a love story. you really have a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of a young girl from a small town who does things big in the city, after having crossed the big usual city c ** p. there have been a few, it's almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have accomplished. Well, me anyway. I think it's because all the work in a bar scenario is very familiar, not just for me, but for many people I know. Do not trust trailers for this one - it aims to get men into.
