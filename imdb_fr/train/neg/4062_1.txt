Few films have left me so uncomfortable and it is not a compliment. Since I saw her at the theater (I'm wondering how it ended there), I experienced 90 minutes of hate and derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other unhealthy movie "Do not answer the phone" - but worse. The wickedness of everything, rape and everything, is shown without distance (unlike the strong stuff like "Last House on the Left") and total disregard for the victims (perfect?) And all the people involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. In the end, I wanted to take a shower. No credit to the director
