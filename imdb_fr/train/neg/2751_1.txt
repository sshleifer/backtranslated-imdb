I even hate to waste the time needed to write 10 lines about this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that a film's bad performance is not a capital crime or that it is twice killed for writing and realizing this disaster. I'm amazed that this film has a budget of $ 75 million, but I'm really happy that it's such a failure, that Shim can not, hopefully, ever make another movie the rest of his life and so do not waste more time of moviegoers. I think the actors would have already put together and lynched it. <br /> <br /> With the resources available, a film of higher quality could have been achieved with this budget. As usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible storyline and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but it sounds like "Citizen Kane".
