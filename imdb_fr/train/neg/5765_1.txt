Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start. The last film was a mediocre effort. Place it next to this charge, it's a classic comedy. While the second part was filled with dated humor and low punches, at least it was funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, imbecilities and visual gags are supposed to be naturally fun. Hitting the viewer over tired tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film is for young idiots who will laugh at everything. When they spoke to the crowd of high school students, any feeling of self-respect was thrown out the window. The ringing parodies are not funny. I have watched them in comedy since 1998. They are so dated. Michael Jackson's jokes are not cool either. What is even worse is that making fun of two broken ones has been "interpreters" whose best days have never been. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been slow. Films like this are the nails that are embedded in his coffin. What happened to real humor? I have not laughed at a movie theater for a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. Do you want proof? Go to your big chain video store and find out what's on the shelves. This film is bad. Do not believe the hype. I would rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than suffer again this bad excuse of a comedy! <br /> <br /> Absolutely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
