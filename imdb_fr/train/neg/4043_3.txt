The film begins with promises but stays too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left in suspense, but we have nothing but languid plans of serious and pensive male faces to savor. Certainly no rope on the wall to help us climb. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We wonder why a loving couple - a father and his son - should be so far removed from the real world that his own world is better. when claustrophobic beyond just imagine. This loss of presence in the real world contrasts, too obviously and unnecessarily, with the son who enlisted in the armed forces. Why not the circus so that we can at least appreciate a color? We are left with a feeling of overwhelming loss, but unfortunately no enlightenment, which is staggering given that the film apparently speaks of a form of realization that is not within the reach of all.
