A doctor who tries to realize the medical dream of transplantation secretly experiments on corpses of the hospital with more or less success. His last chance comes when he wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket lovingly while rescuing her from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this principle I thought I found it. It contains everything that bad moviegoers want: thoracic and cerebral surgery. Surgeons leave with immaculate white exfoliators, unique camera angles (I always like to watch the wheels of the rear passengers), a stripper music for clarinet cheese scenes of death in the history of the film. But unfortunately, these bad times are not good can not beat the sections too bad. <br /> <br /> Jan in the pan annoyed me, with her resounding monologues in a hoarse murmur, laughter a little less than demonic and the fact that she stayed alive with a coffee brewed at Colombian house and two DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I could not even entertain myself with Dr. Bill's excessive righteousness and moral intolerance. . Usually such a ham makes these movies a must in my opinion, in this case I was bored with it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960s version of "body shopping" and I even got drowsy at that time. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on this one. There are better bad movies to entertain your unhealthy sense of humor.
