Years ago, a movie friend and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be useful because it was played by John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated three times at the Oscars. . Until we saw The Incubus, we did not know that John Cassavetes' income was from a film that was offered to him. If we had known what the movie was about before we saw it, we might have completely avoided it. But we did not go out. At the time, my friend and I joked that it was the worst movie of all time. Now, frankly, that's not true. I've seen a lot of badly done Friday night movies on Cinemax (have I just said it out loud?) That are far worse than the Incube. Almost every film featuring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse film than The Incubus. Admittedly, Santa Claus conquers Martians is a film worse than the Incubus. Since then, however, I have always used the Incubus as the threshold below which I did not want to fall. When I talked to a friend about a movie I saw, I will always say it was better (or worse) than the Incube. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
