Oh my God Oh, my God, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the blue screen effects used to create "invisibility" of mom. It looked like they had been shot on cheap video, and it sounded totally unreal, and not even in the right direction, because it's so funny that you end up loving the movie ... <br /> <br I love this movie. Attempts to "steadicam" were also really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low-budget movie, that's fine. You can always make a good movie on a small budget. But, a bad movie and a low budget and effects. It's a bad combination. In this case, such a cursed combo created the fantastic movie "Invisible Mom". If you have children and your children have no taste, they may stay awake all the time.
