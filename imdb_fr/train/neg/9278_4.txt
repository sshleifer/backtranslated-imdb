The fact that I watched this whole movie says a lot about ... or about me. It's not a good movie. Terrible actually. But terrible in the way that caught my attention in this perverse way that looks like watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. That would have made a good subject for MST3K! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a movie dreadful are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, artificial plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will love the death sequences, the poor victims with a gaping mouth and too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the liberator of their death, which is outrageously artificial. Your heart will be warmed by old action shots, like when two women are fighting for a gun and it's going off, but WHO'S SHOT? The two look at each other, then the other, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one of them ends up falling. You will sing (in Latin of course) with the street singers who turn into a horrible chorus of dead who, for a moment, threatened to turn the film into a twisted musical comedy. <br /> <br /> Like me, when movies get worse, they get better, so it might be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current favorite sci-fi schlock, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than lukewarm movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
