I do not know what Oscars voters saw in this movie, but they must have seen things pretty hard to see in this film to be able to give it the best picture, Oscar. All I know is that, fortunately, Gene Kelly played or it was twice as bad as I think. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She does not have that talent, she is not a great dancer and she is not beautiful at all. It's a shame that an actor or an actress can spoil a movie as if it were playing a role because if Leslie Caron had not participated in this film, he might have made a fantastic movie. The story was smart, the staging was not bad and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now, I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying it because I think it's the worst part of the movie. This is probably a good actress but I can not say because I have not seen elsewhere, but I think it was rather bad in "An American in Paris". So, if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you, you'd better look at Singin 'in the rain.
