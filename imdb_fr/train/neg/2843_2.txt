Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a horrible and clumsy ninja movie, make no mistake. But it's also incredibly enjoyable. This is largely thanks to the impressive presence of Chuck Connors, who plays the lead role in the film but only really shines in a few scenes. I guess he's supposed to be like Obi Wan Kenobi ("The hard ninja-buster," exclaims the box) but his "wisdom" is laughable. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration. <br /> <br /> But his two collaborators, Sonny and Dennis, have such a horrible dialogue that "Brooklyn", as we call him, is the colonel. tends to shine in comparison. Pay special attention to Dennis' logic regarding the "genetic splicing" in which Sakura are involved. If you know something about cloning, you will die laughing. And yes, this is an important point for the plot. <br /> <br /> Sakura Killers, a terribly funny movie, is a hard jewel to find. I'm not going to ruin the "trick" that ends for you either, except it's a perfect fit for a Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connors is dead. :-( Because he has the easiest ways to evacuate ninjas.
