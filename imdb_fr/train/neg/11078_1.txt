Honestly, where can I start? It was a low budget movie, a movie played HORRIBLY, it was so cheesy that we all burst out laughing how completely it was delayed! the sword fighting scenes were not even sword fights, they were playing with plastic swords bought at Wal-Mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try to give the impression that they were struggling !! My family and I were in a good mood for a great action movie one day. So we decided to go to the store to get one, and it was the movie The Sawtooth Island. I mean it looked so good, but when we watched it at home, I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, the plot of the film, the script, the script, etc. was a bunch of garbage that I do not even know why the director and the producer even lost their time doing it !! But if you come across this movie, do not get it !!!!!
