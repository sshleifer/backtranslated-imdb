Hey, if you have a little over an hour to kill and the painting is too exciting, I suggest it. If you like cheap B-movies like me, it's good for a laugh! Apart from that, I would not suggest that you rent it, I would wait for it to come on the tube, for example around 4 am, on the free channel of your cable / satellite provider. The group that made this soundtrack by the way was on the road about two years after this movie, and no, they did not sound as good live, according to the two small town critics that I could find. So, again, it's good if you find that grass grows a lot, but it's good to watch if you want to see how NOT to shoot a low-budget movie.
