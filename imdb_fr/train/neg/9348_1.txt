I found this movie embarrassing to watch. I felt like the script was trotting in my throat, as if I could not grasp the subtleties, I needed a voice to spell them all the time for me. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic, I did not really think it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course. They had trouble communicating, which the main character did not really have any problem, except that he had a hard time saying that I loved you at one point, which was a bit of an effort to establish his character cold. He was constantly surrounded by people too! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time are we really alone with the character to really get an idea of ​​his inner loneliness and his trouble. I could not connect with the character and I did not feel any connection with my father. I did not feel anything at all when everything was over, just relieved that it was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor but not a tough guy! The mechanical orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, they should have had three different characters or avoid the teenage stage and focus more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt that the little actor was really good at the beginning of the film !!
