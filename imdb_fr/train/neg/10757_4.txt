I just saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the community of critical viewers on IMDb (and given rise to many insults and insults too). <br /> <br /> I find this a little surprising, because this film is not great (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even really bad). What this movie really is, is ... depressing. Depressing that the American audience is so ready to do tasteless and clich√© heats and cheer them up as spectacular new works. This film is written "retread", from the plot (a disturbing mix of Asimov and modern ultra-action) to the character Smith (a cynical malignant with a spine in titanium), through the special effects ( borrowed from Matrix and some others). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, the ideal action film for today's audience: superficial plot, insipid dialogue, and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (it seems to be the last unsuccessful attempt of Hollywood to create a black Bruce Willis). There are many holes in the story, of all sizes, but I do not think most people who are attracted to this film have enough critical thinking to notice it. Maybe a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to the real winners.
