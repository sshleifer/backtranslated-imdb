You already know how difficult watching this movie is. But I wonder why one of the worst movies of all time should include one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should be not only victims of crime, but also the only real actors and performers. So how on Earth, your Porsche, Lamborghini or anything that could allow these people to come into contact with your cars and ruin you for a reputation you give to millions of people? It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want to get my money back !!!
