Another flag of British cinema falters. Real trash on offer here again. I can not understand (and I'm British) why this patriotic nonsense was made. EIGHT years mark you since the end of the second world war! Other commentators have commented on the seemingly transparent editing and use of archives. This is extremely poorly observed. Archival footage is in abundance. The model aircraft are swaying in "action scenes" like so many kites for children in the wind. The usual sequences of the card room tattoo the film to make us enter supposedly throughout the Maltese event. Guinness must have its worst acting performance ever. The shocking scenes of dog fighting back are laughable. Hawkins bores us all to death in the map area. Ealing did a lot of good movies. This is clearly not one of them. They should have stayed away from this unconvincing rot!
