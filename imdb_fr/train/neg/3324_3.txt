I saw that by accident on a lazy summer afternoon. He was playing on HBO's family programming channel. At first I was attracted to what I thought was Disney animation. But after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote so I could find the "INFO BUTTON", to find out what was in the world on my TV. I do not have anything against Harvey F., I appreciate it in many of his films, but one thing he is not, he's a dubber. While he has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, it only works as part of a larger visual ensemble. Tying his voice to a cute duck made watching a bit difficult. For the rest of the cast, uninspired. I guess working on this movie did not appeal to a very good talent for voice over voice. <br /> <br /> So, a talent for a weak voice, a strong animation ... to whom was this film addressed? Gay teen ducks? I do not understand. Is there really such a shortage of role models for young homosexuals in the making that we have to resort to animated ducks? A cute story, and like the title, this movie that I found hard to love, just like an ugly duckling.
