It seems odd that someone reads this script and says, "It's funny, I mean, it's so hilarious it must be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me more of my time than the director / screenwriter? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks of all possible ways. There is not a hint of good dialogue and not a single sympathetic character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst film of all time, "No Hold's Barred" by Hulk Hogan. It almost looks like Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> <br /> The end is completed by several minutes taken and there is still less than 80 minutes. The members of the cast make fun of the "hilarious" mistakes they made and what went wrong on the set of this "comedy". Glad to see someone laughing somewhere, having a connection with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film is funny. Nothing. And it starts again so many times. It's really that lame. I like movies that are so bad that they are good. It's so bad that ... something, but I do not know what, and I hope we'll never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet does not seem to crack, and is actually the only good thing to do about this wannabe movie. But, it really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
