The perfect murder is foiled when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, former wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who directed this episode), who kills her husband with a poker, has the misfortune to receive a visitor while she is on the point of moving. the body out ... an escaped madman wearing a Santa Claus costume (played by a slyly hideous Larry Drake). She manages for life while trying to find a way to hide the body of her husband. She decides to use an ax, once she kills the killer of Santa who misses several opportunities to cut off the woman's head, to murder her for the murder of her husband. A Santa Claus kills him in a cupboard and chases the woman's daughter as she tries desperately to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES OF THE CRYPT only recycles tired documents involving the old "Santa kills" theme while also adding the often used routine (add nausea): the murder of a woman, her husband for a man, cheating with routine. It's essentially Trainor who tries to find a way to avoid getting caught with a corpse she kills while staying away from a maniac. There is nothing new or refreshing in this intrigue that almost goes through the movements. Not one of the highlights of the show.
