... Or, more precisely, so bad that you will have the time of your life laughing while laughing when you look at it! James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker", dating back to 1983, is certainly one of the most terrible productions that the sub-genre Sword & Sorcery has brought, but it's a lot of fun. The acting is terrible, the plot is pure shit, and the effects and photography could not be more amateurish. But it's the acting, the nerdy effects and the many mistakes that make this film so hilarious. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch asks her to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, in order to liberate the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Getting the sword is easy enough, but the amulet and chalice are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight to the death. The winner must then take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want someone to take his place, so he planned to kill the winner (instead of not organizing the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker aims not only to obtain the three powers of creation, but also to preserve the beautiful daughter of the good king (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of evil Munkar. Fortunately, he is not bored going to the tournament, since he is allowed to bump the magnificent warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of great things, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker beheads a villain with his sword. The falling head, however, is not the head of this guy. The falling head has a red goatee while the decapitated type by Deathstalker had black hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When Warrior Kaira's character (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is seen for the first time in a black dress, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker's travel companion, Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and during the sword, her dress (under which she is, of course, topless) opens, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see from Lana Clarkson, even in front of her face. <br /> <br /> - The last Deathstalker warrior must fight in the tournament, it's a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - The evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. It feeds the eyes and human fingers of this little creature. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unintentionally funny, hilarious and fun scenes. The acting is dreadful, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are a feast for the eyes. Although I described this film as "unintentionally funny," I sometimes felt that some actors were quite aware of the poor quality of the film. There is a lot of gore and a lot of female nudity to entertain the viewer. "Deathstalker" is an unbelievably terrible movie, but I always highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their life!
