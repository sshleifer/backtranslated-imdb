The previous comment made me write this. It is said that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment simply says that this opinion can be expressed by racists. Look, race is nothing. I'm color-blind. I'm like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what? I might add that I'm not 100% Serbian, that I have Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but what's the point? I am dark, mixed race? Is it true? All those who use racist prejudices as ill-intentioned as Lantos (producer and director are racist for me. Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I hold them responsible for the destruction of my life, my family, My country, from Yugoslavia, I hope they will be, all in hell but that will not make our parents dead.I am proud to be Serbian and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians , Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have a multiethnic family). This film does not show the suffering of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo, the terrifying terrorism of street gangs, Muslim extremism. : I kneel down and pray for all the innocent Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox brothers and sisters killed in this war.This film is a manipulation of our misery, fake humanitarians who do not help at all.This helps Lantos to fill the pockets with more bich e, okay!
