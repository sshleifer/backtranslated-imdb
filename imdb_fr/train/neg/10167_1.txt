This TV movie shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw this was that it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. This is the Super Bowl at the Superdome of New Orleans. However, football is never played and we see the backstage watching nothing. With the many stars of this film, it made no difference. I really do not know why I watched this.
