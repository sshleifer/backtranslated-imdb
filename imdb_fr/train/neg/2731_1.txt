Really bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen .... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to catch up with him by giving him the "we know we are doing this" routine. It would have been fun without the fact that "The Simpsons" had already done it. And that still would not have been compensated by the original idea. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks were part of the fantasies of the usual character (mainly J.D.). The backtracking did not even concern the real events that were happening, but only compilations of J.D. or of, I do not know ... Elliott falling. If I wanted to watch a compilation of Scrubs, I would go on youtube and I would not lose half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs has finally fallen into the trap that most sit-coms must, and this disappoints. me, they managed to spend 5 seasons and a quarter without such an episode. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the scrubs would not need to be that kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And just like a passing thought, why on earth was Dr.Cox bald?
