I went to see this movie (actually, I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I just could not watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of Cutting Moments and take a look from time to time. In the end, my stomach was upside down and I felt lightheaded. I had just left the cinema a few minutes after the beginning of the second short film (BTW, of course, I was not the only one to have left the room). It was too violent and disgusting for WAAAAY! I am impressed by the many brave people who really loved him. I do not understand how you can like this kind of movies! The shocking, bloody and horrible images I saw stuck in my head for two days! I'm also trying to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw everything and told me about it) and I think that makes no sense. I mean, this amount of violence and things, has no other meaning than to try to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, in my opinion. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least 'x' thing about it was good." But hey, I guess I will never understand this kind of movies.
