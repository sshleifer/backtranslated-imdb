In fact, it had to be stopped. Do not get me wrong, like bad monster movies. But this one was way too boring, regardless of the catchy music that will get you nowhere. The actress had too many teeth and this moment when she came into contact with one of the animals was a clich√© too obvious. This movie totally betrays the cover of the DVD, which is very interesting. From the cover, we expect a giant monster, but these cute are not as gigantic as electric eels. Past watching another movie called The Killer Rats but that's another criticism. Deep Shock was really bad, a big pity given the fact that its budget is rather high.
