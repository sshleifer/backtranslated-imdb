This film was absolutely awful. I can not think of a good thing about it. The holes in the plot were so huge that you could drive a Hummer through them. The game was so horrible that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that's saying a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue ??? To say that I was a fan of the first (I use this comment without conviction, it is rather a guilty pleasure than anything else). This film had Goldberg to shout loud !!!! Nothing good can come out of this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad you can not even watch it with a group of friends to make fun of you !!! This must be in my top five of the worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is so difficult to give a 1.
