What a desappointment! The score of 6.1 on IMDb aroused slight expectations, but, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me is these braderead, stereotyped academics. Yes, I know that teenagers can be childish, etc., but why are they still portrayed in movies as complete morons? There was a character I thought well, but he / she (not revealing it here) was killed well before the end. The other characters were badly executed and even the so-called hero / heroine just did not do it to me. Positive points: the plot is pretty good and the productions grant a higher value to this type of films. The acting game was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But all of this fails with the bland and headless characters. You just stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and it's generous)
