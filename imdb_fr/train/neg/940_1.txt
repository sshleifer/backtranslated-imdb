Ok guys, we know why we watch a movie like "The Invisible Maniac" (just watch the cover, man!). T and A everywhere (with a lot more T than A). But ... should not there be a story that goes with it? <br /> <br /> "Come," I can hear you saying - "They're just girls undressing Who needs a story?"! <br /> <br /> Well if it was called "NAKED maniacs", I would not have a problem. But since these guys are part of "The Invisible Man", they need a bit of history, you know, to keep your mind busy. <br /> <br /> However, all they can do is how A Mad Doctor creates a serum of invisibility and, when it cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot teen. And when you see the teens at the hairy mine he goes after, you'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> A star, for the T and the A, but there is a little too much gore for skin fans, so go with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, that's it Savannah.
