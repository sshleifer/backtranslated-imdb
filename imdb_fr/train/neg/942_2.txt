Seen this end a night on the cable. At the time, I did not know that the girl named "Shannon Wilsey" was actually the porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and she was so often naked, thank God) that I sat down through this motte in cerebral decomposition. I like cheese movies as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but it was way beyond cheese and more rancid. The really annoying overpowering of the mad scientist and the almost complete incompetence of the director, screenwriter and special effects people undermines the gratuitous nudity that is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before becoming the plasticized Barbie doll she has become a porn queen, is really interesting to watch - she is beautiful, she falls to the ground, bursts out laughing uncontrollably, peeks out of the camera and laughs, and usually seems to have a great time, which is more than one can say for the audience. Because even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a good deal of this nude image, she still can not hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly done and boring movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if the service is wired one night, check it out, but do not waste your rent money.
