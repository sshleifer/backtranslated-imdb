There is a reason why Jay Leno himself does not recognize this film. It's still one of the worst movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the scenario lacks direction and the director himself does not seem to know how to take this film. "A boyfriend movie", "an action / comedy", "mystery". It looks like he's halfway there, he gives up and is just ready to leave. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It's a pity they lost their time and their gifts to make this movie a mess. Jay Leno and Pat Morita, before getting involved in this project, had spent years tinkering with their crafts on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita was already a full-fledged star, acting consistently since the mid-1960s as a star of TV series and classic films such as "Happy Days", and the sad but affable "Mr. T and Tina ". And won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film "Midway", "The Karate Kid" and many others. Mr. Leno can be seen on TV shows dating back to the mid-1970s. And was a leading artist in America's comedy clubs. It can be seen in countless TV spots and in great movies. It's too bad that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
