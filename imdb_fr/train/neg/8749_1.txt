A terrible movie as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy, who rewarded one of the programmers murdered in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that is virtually defined by his hatred of Microsoft. They played a key role in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to this fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record of SUN's involvement, but it is clear that the writers of this film know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
