In general, I like dinosaur movies but this one is pure shit. No script, no dialogue, no interpretation. And the brave colonel Rance trying to show that he is hard and that bending his mouth looks like a twin brother the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. It was therefore a total waste of time (thankfully, no loss of money because I saw the film on television). And I really can not understand 7 people who noted this sh * t 10. They had to joke. My advice, if you see this title coming out!
