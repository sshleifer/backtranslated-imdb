In recent years, there has been a vogue for zombie movies, often ironic, as well as other media incarnations of the flesh-eating resurrected dead. "Fido" is a movie that either tries to make money, or simply a manifestation of it, or both - and falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we see the undead in the contrasting context of an alternatively largely stereotypical, very clean and squeaky story (we're in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now domesticated as slaves) version of a suburb of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty funny concept in itself, and maybe enough for a comic five-minute sketch, but it can not stand alone a feature film. The joke that decaying corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town repeats itself over and over again and loses all its effectiveness. The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize passers-by. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar familiar line for a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The magnitude and the artificiality of the representation of the "1950s" can only irritate us. He is so stylized, obviously inspired by "Pleasantville", that it appears more clearly in the signs of his 50s that he really looks like something that could have happened between 1950 and 1959. about it, as if the film boasted in an empty and thoughtless way of the greater openness, simplicity and superiority of the Earth of the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Since the characters are such representations of "types" of pop culture of the 1950s, it is difficult to invest a lot of emotional effort. Everyone has a few traits that are thrown at him - Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his obsession with killing his father - but they remain pretty two-dimensional. Performance within the limits of this bad writing is acceptable. The best is Billy Connolly in the role of Fido the zombie, who, in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein", actually gives character and sympathy to a green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are small pieces of insolent allegory thrown around market fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, etc., but none of this really works on a level global, and the filmmakers do not; I do not really stick with anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not really go beyond the fragile joke of "Look! The zombies in" Leave it to Beaver! "" for a good hour and a half.
