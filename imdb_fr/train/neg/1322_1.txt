.... because if I were, I might have wished it to be crucified on a wooden cross! I always try to determine the plot of this movie - and I'm "generous", there was even a plot to start. As mentioned before, it is on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is the star. He was hardly in the movie. And if he was really "frustrated" as the back cover indicated, well, it's probably because he said YES to be in this movie disaster and could not get out! The film really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what his role in the movie was supposed to be, apart from the extreme parallels, was not a mystery as big as Gene Barry's role - or was it not . And speaking of "big" ... the one who had the brilliant idea of ​​passing to Gene Barry Humpty Dumpty outfit, which highlighted his pants literally tight on the chin, should be sentenced to difficult times by watching this sober and smashed film. I could go on and on about the horrors of this film, from the dialogue that does not correspond to the mouth of the "actors" (think Clutch Cargo), to the erratic jump from stage to stage (again, be generous even in calling the picture frames "scenes"), the lack of intrigue ... However, if you like the genre of the early 70s and if you are in a Michigan country house with nothing but this film and a box of recommending to drink a good bottle of wine before embarking on this strange cinematographic adventure, because you will be grateful for not remembering it the next day!
