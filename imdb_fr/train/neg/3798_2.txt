And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now, I did not see Nemesis' first film, but I checked the information and said: What? Why? Because in the first movie, Alex was a man. But again, the first was defined in the future, so maybe Alex is brand new and the scientist just made Alex a woman this time. Who knows, at least the film did not deal with anything. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby at the time (or whatever you want, as he was, in the future) escapes with his mother to the help from a special ship and find herself in Africa in the 80's. Over there, mom gets killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. The tribe is then slaughtered by a cyborg of the future, then Alex hides and ends up killing the cyborg. So the. Does this sound familiar to you? <br /> <br /> Terminator is not the only film to be torn up here, Predator also has its market share and I think that the first film of Fly, that of Vincent Price, becomes special appointment to give a base solid to build your cyborgs head. <br /> <br /> Come on, what else? Okay, the movie was pretty classic, but it had bad effects for a movie from the mid-90s. That would have looked good for an 80s movie. The biggest problem is the plot. Things are happening and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most disgusting movie I've ever enjoyed (?) To watch, but it's getting close to it. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about acting, because let's be honest here: was someone waiting for Oscar-winning performances here? Oh well ... at least I found Sue Price hot this way Amazonian warrior. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie note: 2/10 There are not many advantages about total quality. And despite the basic plot of the film, it makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Movie note: 4/10 I sometimes had bursts of laughter because of the movie's misfortune, so it's a little bit worth it.
