Ridiculous. Annakin, a 9-year-old Angelica, is turning into Annakin, a 19-year-old whiner who seems to seduce Amidala, her 5-year-old elder. Today, 22-year-old Jedi warrior Annakin has bad dreams and is taking the opportunity to slaughter children, her friends, and the whole environment of her life, because a crazy old man convinced her: a) her precious wife could really die, and b) only he can prevent that. Ludicrous squared. <br /> <br /> I think that people who like this movie do not pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are amazing (literally, not the perverse sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and benevolent anchor of the entire series, but culminating, he scrapes Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and lets him suffer. Does not someone think it's a bit out of character? Not to mention the fact that it was rather stupid to try one's luck. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least a story that showed characters consistent with plausible motivations. None of this here. The story could have been written by a 10 year old child. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is pretty cool.
