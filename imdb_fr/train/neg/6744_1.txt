As you may all know, JIGSAW did not visit Blackbuster because of Full Moon staff member Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all video channels. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer to take no JIGSAW and double the number of BLEEDs. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED to a success. The major problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst movies of all time and, as we all know, JIGSAW is fine. I urge all of you to access the BLEED page on the Internet and vote for the movie that caused the harm to JIGSAW and all your talents. Likewise, you should go to the JIGSAW page and cast high votes (if you have not already done so). JIGSAW must be at least 8 or 8.5 and BLEED must be reduced to about 2 (put it on the list of the 100 worst movies on the Internet). Also try to convince your friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you're fine, - Matt
