This is one of those topics I can talk to a little more than most people because I hate noise and have no idea how they live in big cities, in New York, especially how people sleep at all! I'm surprised people can handle all the noise these days. The basic plot of the movie is that it is an interesting subject. It's a shame, that's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent but, apart from a few scenes (especially with Margarita Leiveva, his absolute supermodel), he did not really seem to be around. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents see the absolutely amazing and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is beautiful as a model. Even when they try to make him look more girl next door. It makes me sad that there may be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without skills or redemptible talents, to have more glory and success than this talented beauty. I did not care about this film because the scenario is not very good, but I'm happy to have discovered new talent. I hope producers and filmmakers will think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be part of a big-budget movie. If they manage to make Megan Fox a star (come on, she's not very hot, and her "talent" actor is worse than TV shows made for Disney), it should happen easily for her, as she is beautiful and has talent! I would recommend that he change his last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. Hopefully this will be her career, and if there is any justice, she can appear in a big summer film or two over the next two years.
