I got a copy of this movie thinking it was the 1964 movie with 'Zombie Bloodbath' among its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other is really bad! This movie is pretty bad too; you obviously can not go to a movie called "Zombie Bloodbath" and you expect to see a masterpiece. In all honesty, he is up to the title with the amount of gore displayed ... but everything feels very old and tired, which is not helped by the atrocious actor and the stupid plot. It's just an average nuclear spill that makes people turn into zombies, and so on. The film begins with a sequence that sees people melt and lets you know what you're going to do. low quality zombies waste. There is a lot of gore in the movie, and it's a very good job otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too, and has been clearly set up by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's Day of the Dead, though it may be just about anything with zombies and gore. It all comes down to a generally predictable and useless end and, overall, I can not say I was impressed!
