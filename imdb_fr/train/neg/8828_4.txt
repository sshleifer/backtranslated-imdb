Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) travels with his local fishing partners to Jindabyne, Australia, for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers the body of a Native woman floating face down in a river, the situation seems to have deteriorated. The biggest victim of the weekend is men's common sense. They do not leave the ravine and finish their weekend fishing with excellent catches. They then move towards the body and signal the body. <br /> <br /> The life of the city and men is quickly turning into disorder. The local media is invading them and accusations of native prejudice are being heard by the native people. Claire, Stewart's wife (Laura Linney, THE PINK EMILY EXORCISM) feels the deep sense of what her husband and friends have done, but must fight it through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos is the life of this young woman who is now a media show, spread over a slab of the morgue. His assassination and subsequent immersion in water are symbolic of what lies beneath the city of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and proscribed. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand. Partly, two young children: the son of Stewart and Claire, led by a MÃ©tis Australian whose mother was murdered a few years ago. The girl lives at her grandparents' house and tries to let go of her mother as best she can, and the discovery of a new body seems ?? Curiously ?? a method to achieve this (again, the underlying Jindabyne current is assumed). <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone in this commune of Jindabyne feels what lies beneath its surface, but none of them wants to dive take a look at the murky waters and take a look eye around you (the symbolism is perceptible when a nearby lake, used for recreation and swimming, contains the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, until Claire forces them. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting if it is a little too complicated. There are too many scenarios to explore and this is not done; too many loose threads. The acting was ok, but the shooting was terrible. Unstable cameras, dark or grainy shots and a general generalized general lack have affected the entire production. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic movies, NORTHFORK being one of my favorites in this area. But Jindabyne had to peek over the murky water to see her own problems, which just did not happen.
