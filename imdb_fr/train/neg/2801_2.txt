After a music video almost gothic and all fruits, the film begins with the murder of Cassidy, the main singer. In a perfect world, that would be it and the final credits would be launched. We do not live in this world. The insipid members of the group decide to go see a clown to contact his dead essence. When I talk about clown, I'm talking about a real clown. He tells them that they are all going to die via the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit has Dora, one of the group's girlfriends). We did not care because the characters are all boring, tasteless and extremely horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly similar family name if there is one already) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, after The Attendant, and Tower of Blood, must know that he continues to bullshit for his life) between the incompetence of the film and the need of the spectator to remain awake. Not enough blood to soothe the hunting dogs, nor enough nudity to satisfy the perverts. This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My note: F I saw: Starz on Demand
