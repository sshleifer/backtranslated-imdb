The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate the depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really did show a top-notch performance, and the girl who played her sister was really great and beautiful. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I like Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before I read the book. It's a bit too "real" for me. I prefer the little spiritual tiffs of Lestat and Louis to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so scary and after her character did what she did, the movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the series. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to reveal anything) Sorry, but it's just not my kind of show.
