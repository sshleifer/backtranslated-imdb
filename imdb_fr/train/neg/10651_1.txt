Want to know the secret of making a movie slasher movie in a fitness center? Complete the film with charming ladies in ultra-tight training suits and let them bump and ground as if they were in a gentleman's club. That's what the producers of this horrible movie slasher did and this little gimmick made me watch until the end of time. It's the worst slasher movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change channels, they added another scene with the girls training and I stayed there. As a slasher movie, Killer Workout fails in all categories I can think of. As a showcase for pretty working girls, it's a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, unless you think half of the movie is a great T & A show.
