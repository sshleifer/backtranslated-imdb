A man who walks without motive ... I will never find those two hours of my life. The guy continued to take on identities and cheat on his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did it win a prize anywhere? I realized that he loved his father, but other than that, the movie was completely insane to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason? How did that enrich his life ??? Why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend that the movie even leave while sleeping ...
