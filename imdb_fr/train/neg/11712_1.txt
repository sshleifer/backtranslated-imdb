The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were the age where action movies were our thing to enjoy the most (2nd most ok). We came out so insulted that we wanted to get our money back, but the time could never be recovered. <br /> <br /> The editing is what killed this movie. As the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles equipped with rocket launchers, the film completely insults the public's intelligence by asking these vicious rogues of the VW Bugs 4x4 to fire rockets at the truck. Please, rockets on a truck known to carry plutonium? The worst thing is that these VW manage to get 15 to 18 shots of a rocket launcher. You would see on VW with 4 rockets shoot 2, cut around the truck with the last hitched, come back a second later with two rockets attached, shoot another, then go in front of the truck and now he's back together with 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We resisted in the hope of a successful arrival that would never have happened. Looks like they just ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> It's just ridiculous.
