I never wanted to see this movie, then one day, jokingly, I looked at it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin, I would like to ask a question about film politics. It hides behind the mask of women who "succeed in the city," but the only way for them to do that is to use their sexuality rather than their intelligence or their skills. These women are no longer the whores. Are less attractive girls not allowed to succeed? This is not the only right-hand message of the film, there are hundreds of US flag shots and huge amounts of money. Capitalism is a fine example of the power of the United States. Nothing that has spiritual, moral or artistic value is included in this film. Money is described as the only thing that matters to young people. <br /> <br /> The bar manager says she does not allow drug addicts in her bar, and then goes to poor gallons of alcohol. his neck, then his staff and his clients. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illicit drugs. <br /> <br /> interest for the public (when she undresses or with her boyfriend) is his father still involved? We watch her undressing with the camera while practically caressing her legs as she phones her father. She "sells" her father as she sold her boyfriend. I find this very strange. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading for women and, frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
