I absolutely hate when a film collapses completely towards the end, after investing an hour. and that's what happened with this movie. I am intrigued by his actors and by the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I did not go to read this story, but I can not imagine it ending as this movie ends. Fortunately, I did not pay much money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a mess of excellent acting (the woman in particular was so perfect). but milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! now it was funny. I did not do research on its manufacture but it played as if the director had lost his marbles or died three quarters of the film. Before that, a story and characters were developing, there were a number of interesting intrigues and there was not too much wasted time. but ooh it lasts half an hour - if it was not the most ugly and rascally denouement I know, I do not know what it is. I just hate when his faith is so destroyed like that; it's like an act of violence.
