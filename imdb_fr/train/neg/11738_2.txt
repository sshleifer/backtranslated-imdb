"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for methamphetamine in the Midwest, but it sounds like a hard note from "Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad and methamphetamine is horribly pernicious, as addictive and destroying people, families and communities. But those characters who are either idiotic or ridiculous and intrigue will not teach this lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has charisma on screen, his partner Diane Foster plays a ridiculously stupid, wide-eyed, drug-tainted innocent.
