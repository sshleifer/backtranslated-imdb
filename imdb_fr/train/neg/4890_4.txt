A film about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a gendarme husband whom she loves ... but she also loves sex! During the movie, she puts several men to bed - including her husband AND her brother! There is also a lesbian sequence (tamed). <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X movie. It was a big hit when he came out. Unfortunately, it does not date well. <br /> <br /> It is well done and Erica Gavin is just great (whatever happened to her), and she was VERY colorful ... but by today's standards, it's extremely docile. . I'm surprised he's now NC-17 - there is no hardcore sex and there are only topless women and no male nudity at all. Plus, it's (unfortunately) pretty boring and the addition of politics at the end was confusing (and rather silly). It is worth catching however to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. Supposedly, I saw the cut version (which has a rating R) but I heard that a few seconds here and there lack. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film, "Beyond the Valley of Dolls", is much better and looks great. Catch that instead.
