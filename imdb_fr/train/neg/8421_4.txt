It's funny that I have to re-read this film, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I reread it, because recently, I had the chance to witness the rebirth of RC The play "Journey's End" the sheriff on the scene in New York, Belasco Theater , featuring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as under the brilliant direction of David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the broken theater. I'm not exaggerating, I was flabbergasted. After almost two and a half hours a recreated representation and very claustrophobic life of a soldier in the trenches of the Somme (I assume), during World War II, bustling lively manner by all involved, I exit from the theater with aspen. <br /> <br /> Be careful, I'm not easily shocked, nor too sensitive. I am myself a theater actor and director. So I know the buttons to get some effects, both emotional and psychological. <br /> <br /> But what I was attending was so alive. that I had chills in the spine as I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions were animated, watching "Aces High", the film based on this piece and even adapted to the screen, in cooperation with RC The sheriff himself, little of time before his death. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the screen takes place in the skies above France. The claustrophobic atmosphere is therefore at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film is the aerial battle scenes, which seem dated in their special effects, compared to current standards, but which remain very valid in the film. the flight tactic adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were some adaptations to Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" screen, which takes place in trenches and not in the sky, but it was the "German" view of things, if one wanted to be picky about such things. <br /> <br /> "The end of the trip" is the other side of the coin and would have made an excellent film, had they left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer to DVD is mediocre, even if in widescreen and adapted to 16: 9 television screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a film. cinema. No more no less. It has various flaws, such as scratches and minor dots, although the copy, for the rest, is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another World War I movie in your collection, especially for those who love and love to watch. aerial battles between old ones, so this is a photo for you. But I would rather suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although this is also a film full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love good play and drama, I'll leave this one out. Buy the piece. Go look at the room, if you have the chance to get a good recovery near you, but stay away from this possible adaptation. <br /> <br /> It's an anti-war film, certainly, but the weakest. I have never seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of players such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is a bluff because they are seen only very weakly and very Short cameo roles in the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth all offer very weak performances, not for lack of skills, but for lack of truth and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in this document and, as has been said before, it is dragging itself to the dubious end. Doubtful because in the original piece, none of the men we know and sympathize with are alive. They are all killed in a mission fatal and futile. In the film, they all die except by Malcolm McDowell, who manages to stay alive one more day, the commander of the wing unlucky group, just to receive three other pilots who will fly and die for another lost cause . <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a naked scene in total darkness. You only hear the roaring cannons, the whistling machine guns and the grenade impacts throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain rises. Lights. And here they are all. Aligned, upright and steep. Obedient corpses ... <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and more shocking than the final "Aces High", which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do it, I would take the piece and develop it, as was planned. Adding here and there action scenes on the ground, history visualize the horror and massacres "external" perpetrated in the "vast fields of France" around men involved, but then, by strictly focusing on what is happening, this little "cabin" on the brink of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> You want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask us. <br /> <br /> That's not it.
