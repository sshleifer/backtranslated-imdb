The people who rent this movie are the real disappointments. I hope at least that Leonard will make good money, because his savings were hijacked by a manager a few years ago and he is now over 70 years old. . But this movie is just terrible. At first, Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then, for an hour and a half, the film focuses on the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close-ups of over-emotional singers. Cohen's interview takes place in close-ups of lo-fi videos and I wanted so much to see a medium or long shot all over his body! I do not care about the comments of the performers, especially those of the ego Edge and Bono. None of the performers in this film have played a song as good as Leonard's, and if you're thinking of seeing it and you have the slightest doubt, take it into account. It would be a special PBS acceptable, perhaps, for a single time. But I will even hesitate to get a DVD. When the film finally shows Leonard "Tower of Song", a semi-performing scene, he is ruined by Bono. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, the first issue of Rufus, Martha's Traitor) are ruined by the context of the rest of this turgid blah. Forget this one and go and buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay tribute to him.
