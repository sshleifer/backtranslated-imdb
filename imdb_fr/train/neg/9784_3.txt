Mind you, my friends and I saw the movie based on its title alone. It's cute, although it's obvious in its plot and direction - you know where the movie goes in the first five minutes. My main argument with the plot is that, while it remains pretty consistent, they never explain a lot of things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overworked mother, a stressed sister ... it's a bad family, but aside from the occasional mention of the sister, nothing solves the problem. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles ... it seemed pretty random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... children were not bad actors, but their script came out a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a nice niche movie was set aside for one special blah effect, lame scripts and a blatant plot.
