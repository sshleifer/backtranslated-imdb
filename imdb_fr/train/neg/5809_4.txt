I do not see why the filmmakers have redone this film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an exceptional actor and Baldwin was an insufficient actor. He has no passion in his game. Plus, the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring despite the fact that the film's making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin was jailed in Mexico. I think it's a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> I think it was not necessary to do it again, or if they decided to redo a classic, they had to choose an excellent actor for the lead role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
