I'm a real fan of the original Cracker series and I have them all on DVD. Cracker sometimes had a tendency to excel, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to win despite themselves. I count the first Cracker among the big British crime series of that time, and the competition is fierce: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Sherlock Homes by Jeremy Brett and many others. Cracker, with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes it even sadder "A new terror" ... <br /> <br /> very pale imitation of the former glory of Cracker. I forced myself to sit all this time, convinced that it could not be so serious, and that a spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Some critics: First, just to have a potential bias from the start: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war screed who buzzed throughout the major part of the show. The top: the killing of two innocent US criminals and a British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, "understandable, but not justified." I thought "I waded in two hours of shit just to hear that disgusting little drivel?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone of my convictions ... Beyond politics, I had the distinct feeling that this Cracker was just an accessory to propaganda, and that it actually helped to undermine a terribly weak scenario. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much airtime did he get with Robbie Coltrane? Fitz was almost a player in this adventure, as if he were an afterthought plugged into a story originally written without any thought of Fitz's role. Coltrane could have carried the series on his broad shoulders and still very soft, but the writer apparently thought of something else and missed the opportunity, by far. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT AN ABYSME SCENARIO! There were some sparks and some developmental elements of the real character (Fitz's son declaring that Fitz could not stay home if he missed his plane for Australia, the inspector who liked to beat his bad performers over the back of their plane, heads, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus), but not enough to carry the tedious plot. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? It would have been interesting ... After all, it was Manchester. Ten years later, she would be in the ranks. Another wasted opportunity (or maybe the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot more (that's bad) to say, but I'll end with a curiosity: at the end of the show (when she announced that "Director's Cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I was thinking about AH-HA! The cut of the director, which we probably have to pay the price, could contain all benefits that I expected to see tonight, but never have been, in the manner of a coherent and interesting scenario.Unfortunately, after having convinced myself to attend the horrible free version of "A New Terror "in the hope of seeing something, anything, that deserves to be watched, only to be disappointed, I have no hope to motivate myself to pay for a second, potentially longer version and It also made me angry that the BBCA was slicing and dicing, and sacrificing the tempo s issue to account for the endless flow (every ten minutes or so) of advertisements. . <br /> <br /> Finally, I quote the first paragraph of the Variety review titled "A New Terror": it really says it all: "The initial enthusiasm for Robbie Coltrane, who was resuming his role as a ruthless star , boozing, womanizing Criminal psychologist Jimmy McGovern is determined to star in this revival video.Jolting at first in his message - to know that Americans are a bunch of little nomads who do not care terrorism before it comes crashing down on our doorstep, McGovern's mug sweeps the story and puts out the pleasure of seeing Fitz come back to the case.
