Sensational. I've seen some very bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. This is the worst film I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the US military in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to finish watching this ridiculous movie, not that it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt of authenticity in the film. Not so much as the smallest little flap. It looked like it had been written by an 8-year-old who had developed all his notions of war (and military behavior) from comics. The film was shot in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can not explain in depth the atrocious production values ​​of this trash trash can. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but that would take virtually forever. Old unit shoulder patches that have not been seen or worn since the Second World War, as well as the character's identification plates, such as "ColCollins" (worn by the character "Colonel Collins"), which were actually spelled with the mirror image "N" of the Russian alphabet (not the American alphabet), the list goes on and on. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot and more specifically the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was filled with ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and insane clichés. <br /> <br /> Neither the scenario itself. neither were the characters credible or credible in the least. It was ridiculously puerile, to the extreme. It was obviously a film intended to please strictly prepubescent boys, and I do not doubt that they would find this film absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has NO quality that redeems at all. It's a total waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone reading this to let this garbage can pass; it's really not worth losing a single moment of your time.
