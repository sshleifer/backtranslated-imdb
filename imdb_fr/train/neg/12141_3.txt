... because 99 times out of 100, the producers have lied (or to someone else) to rent or buy their * blessed censored *. <br /> <br /> The Shock-O-Rama cinema proves the In truth again with the release of "Feeding the Masses", an entry perhaps well-intentioned but quite inept and dreary in the genre of zombies. Dear friends, it's not just about low budget movies, but VERY VERY small movies made by a group of people who - I'm sorry, I know they have a family that loves them - will not be never never. in variety in any meaningful way. This is a baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, people, not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre, but I do not blame the actors; they had no direction. They had no direction, because the scenario was a half-cooked zombie fantasy, without any sense of real cinematic narrative. The characterization is thin at best, not because of the weak dialogue and the soporific direction. Have I already mentioned that the script and the direction are quite lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great moments of character, nothing. The very principle of government repression of the media is based on sophomoric "commercial breaks" and a non-dramatic scenario that defies rational analysis and clumsily blocks its ridiculous completion. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government remove the truth about a virulent zombie outbreak while the reality would be visible everywhere? Why would they give it more than just a try? In this age of cellphone cameras with wireless access, what could they expect to accomplish for at least a day? Now, if they covered something, like their own guilt ... but "Feeding the Masses" never explores such possibilities. Instead, he insists on absurdity and badly organized events to find laughter and / or meaning, begging his audience not to notice the almost total lack of production value beyond mere filming equipment. Has anyone in this movie been paid? I hope the actors did it, if only for their lost time in career dead ends like this one; at least the technicians have accumulated legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will have little to gain from "Feed the masses". The gore is remarkably docile for people without a budget of its own, and there is no separate play or memorable effect. They are all eminently forgettable, in fact. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even a junk like the Australian stillborn "Undead" was miles ahead of "Feeding the Masses". Sorry, guys, go back to the drawing boards and take your deceitful marketing with you.
