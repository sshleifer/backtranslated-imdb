I think the biggest disappointment of this film was that until the end, I was hoping that the casting acting instructors would come forward and apologize for the poor quality of their role. When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant landscapes and the efforts made to create a magnificent ensemble and spectacular images, it is unfortunate that little attention has been paid to the action. <br /> <br />
