Unheard, ignorant, ill-conceived, killing a career (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), A deeply unfathomable trash. No wonder Reb Braddock has not made any film since, because anyone who has the chance to make his first film according to his own rules, based on his own scenario, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself even, create something like CE, whoever believes that THIS was a story that deserves to be told to the world, does not deserve a second break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told to do and they do it well. It's just that they should not have done it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4
