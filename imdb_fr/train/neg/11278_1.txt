This film is simply one of the worst films of all time and is a damning indictment not only for the British film industry, but also for the unskilled pirates at work today. Not only has the film been distributed by the general public, it also contains a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I do not know and I just do not care enough to participate in the debate because the film was so terrible that it deserves no thought. be warned and stay away from this garbage. but apparently, I need to write ten lines of text in this review, so I might as well detail the plot. His evil friend and colleague left his father's company to form a nobility of man and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian Mafia and its shady accents, as well as stupid and very stupid twists. I should have asked for my money, but maybe I was still shocked by the experience. If you want a good detective film, look at the usual suspects or the godfather, what about the lock, the stock ... it's the top of the contemporary British crime movie .....
