The fact that this bad excuse for a showcase of amateur hours has been announced at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most independent filmmakers today. <br /> <br /> First of all, the art of cinematography exists. Just taking a 16mm camera and directing it to the one with a line is not a real movie. <br /> <br /> I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that the director did not take someone's camcorder ... <br /> <br /> Second, independent films are supposed to talk about real people. There is nothing real about this film. None of the characters seems to be even humanly distant. <br /> <br /> What they discover is the brainchild of a writer who tries to impress his buddies by showing them how cool and nervous he is. . <br /> <br /> Sorry, this is neither a good writing nor a good staging. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the envelope of a bad film that has made its way to Sundance. Hard to believe it was one of the best films ever presented ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me lose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
