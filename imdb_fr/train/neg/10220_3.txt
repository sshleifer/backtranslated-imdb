First, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambush of a cavalry by the Cheyenne. Then come what can only be described as a long boring central section, with Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue", totally wrong, traveling together to reach the security of an army garrison. Miss Bergen pronounces inappropriate four-letter words every time she opens her mouth and gives the impression that she just came out of a Jack Nicholson movie of the 1970s. I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and last section concerns the totally free massacre of an Indian village. It's so obvious that it's an exaggeration to rely on anti-war propaganda, which seems simply long, scandalous and artificial. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here is an idea. Why do not you watch the movie you're commenting instead of tweeting your Liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, it is for film criticism. - MERK
