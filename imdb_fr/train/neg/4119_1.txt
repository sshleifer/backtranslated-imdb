I thank God for not going to the movies for this film. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if a movie could be worse than this one. they spent millions of dollars on this movie for nothing. terrible scenario and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man of this film company;) it's a very big fiasco! in 2000, can they still laugh at this kind of film? embarrassing ...
