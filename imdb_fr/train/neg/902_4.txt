I guess today this film is relevant because it was a Sofia Loren debut. She was 19 years old when the film was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sofia Loren. I was surprised when she came to the camera after getting tanned skin and makeup of brown to look like an Ethiopian princess. Admittedly, today, this would have been considered an insult and avoid in the making of a film. It became annoying to see Mrs. Loren paint in flesh color throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film would have been better realized if the real opera singers had shot it. Then, the songs and gestures of the faces of the real artists would have been obvious. I dismiss others' comments that true opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Mrs. Loren is 19 years old and still is, the film would have been better received. although it is played on the stage. After all, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" singing behind the curtain! Do not neglect the success of using heavy opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television advertisement for the J. G. Wentworth company, the opera singers on stage singing with such professionalism the praises of the company's product. This is one of the best TV commercials to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of the printing of the film also makes this production of a slightly lower quality. The colored ink has faded a lot and we can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> To improve this film on DVD, the production company must add subtitles in English so that we, who do not speak Italian, know what the lyrics say. This would help the story and teach it more than the narrator who gives 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Watch this film, not because of Aida's story, nor because it's an opera. Apart from Mrs. Sofia Loren, none of her co-actors are known or remembered by this writer. Watch this film instead if you are a fan of Mrs. Loren and want to see her at 19, regardless of her production. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
