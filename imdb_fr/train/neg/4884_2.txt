Criminally Insane 2 is included on Satan's new Black Wedding / Criminally Insane DVD. It's also a good thing, because when I saw a movie and I know there's a sequel (especially something as obscure as this one), I'm always curious. My curiosity is now satisfied and I will never look at it again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks", and images of Ethel asleep, evoking good memories, I suppose. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from Napa State (she wonders if she could see The Cramps playing during her stay there?) And was sent to a halfway house run by a beautiful old lady that Ethel immediately calls "granny". All this is filmed with a video camera, so the image and sound are rather pathetic, and it's even complete with some "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her job, which is to send anyone between her and the food, especially the guy who attends one of her acts of chaos and extorts her dessert. Also, you need to ask yourself which halfway house for murderers would have a large drawer filled with sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. I guess all this is a question of misguided "trust". If you like or do not like Criminally Insane, anyway, there's no good reason to watch this show, except out of curiosity. One may wonder why those responsible for this project even worried. 2 out of 10
