I discovered this film with a retailer selling OOPs. And this one is surely a POO. A year after The Exorcist, she is back in business with this movie, but what we all discovered is that Blair's career has never been revealed, she never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of his films are in OOP. She gives a good performance in this film. This is a rejection not recognized by his parents and who has no friends. I played at age 15 playing with a 14 year old girl, it's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers where they stick a broom of her virginity. In most editions, it's cut, why, I do not know, there is no blood, ok, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A, so nothing to offend people. But the film is slow, extremely slow. It does not make me happy normally but I almost fell asleep. It's just a matter of becoming a rebel against the 14-year-old society, without the blood running, nothing and nothing. Why this is classified in horror is still a wonder for me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as is.
