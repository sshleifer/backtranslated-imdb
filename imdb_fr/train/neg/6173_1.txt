This film is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and clumsy. Some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis, but I am certainly not to the extent described in this lame film. My first reaction was that this film must have been directed by Oliver Stone, but I made a mistake this time. There are apparently many others.
