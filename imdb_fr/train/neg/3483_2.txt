Surviving Christmas (2004) (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier and D: Mike Mitchell. Stripped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie does not want to be alone at Christmas, so he decides to go back to his childhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family who lives there now and forces him to pretend to be his family. . An uncomfortable, unidimensional performance of Affleck, who acts mainly with a bright smile, makes his character appear as a mentally unbalanced slide, but Gandolfini and O'Hara breathe life into this mess. Even for the farce, his foolishness is heavy, few things make sense from one scene to another and his sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's smile. 91 min., Evaluated PG-13. * Â½
