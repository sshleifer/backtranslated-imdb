** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. Seriously. Acting in absolute horror, the FX are fearsome and the plot is terrible. But hey, it's so bad that it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's nice! Just grunt and laugh at phrases like "I guess that's what you call CROCTEASING". as women flash their crocodile breasts. I mean COME ON it's funny because it's so bad! He has such horrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while, it just gets to the point that the film turns into shit. I really started falling asleep. Believe me though, the plastic crocodile foot stamping on the leaves and the constant noises of a crow tail make you laugh for a long time. Although I have to say that it had a cool side when the crocodile tore this guy in half and he stayed there for a while to find out what to do. Heh heh, the stupid movie, which must be nominated for the MST3K line !!
