A lot of people like to talk about this TV movie when they talk to the vast legions of Hanks-philes to say that Tom actually made shitty movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story) . The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons style game" that ends up driving our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charming in the early 1980s and focuses on the imminent threat posed to our young people by these perverse role-plays. <br /> <br /> I prefer, however, to consider "labyrinths and monsters" as a turning point. point in the "What happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he made us all vibrate by proxy by beating Matt Dillon. Few people (especially those of us who regularly read "Dynamite!") Could say that great things were reserved for him. <br /> <br /> Then came Rona Jaffe. The line of demarcation between bad acting and bad writing is extremely thin, so I leave you to decide who does Makepeace's performance in this area. All I know is that the last major version in which I saw him was "Vamp", it was in 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman ", but by that time, the torch of Brat Pack had been passed to the others with the straighter hair and the retaliatory retaliation. <br /> <br /> I can not, in all conscience, recommend this film. Look at him, if only to see Chris Makepeace, a young idealist, before Rona Jaffe enjoys his soul.
