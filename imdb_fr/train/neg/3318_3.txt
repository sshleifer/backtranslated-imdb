What is the quality Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the good film for her ... Too bad she is completely absent. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it's so superficial and the characters are little more than caricatures. It may not have been as easy to reduce the book's 600 pages in two hours of exposure, but I was expecting more than old furniture and tea cups. I sighed with relief every time I saw an actor who did not surpass the mark of suraction (a few times).
