I will say this - This director talks about RAW images ... Most of us are not ready to confront each other head on. Images of sex, suicide, murder and "relieving oneself" constantly bombard the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I do not think I can see this film again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some very nice shots and "picture moments" in the movie (the fans, the wire fish in their hair), but the story left me more in need of (more strictly in the Meme it to see? "). <br /> <br /> Note: if you tend to vomit or vomit easily ... do not see this movie.
