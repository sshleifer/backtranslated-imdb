What a sorry excuse for shooting movies in New Zealand. I am ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this film exists and is currently being broadcast on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). The cast is composed of a large number of local soap stars. The boat, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) all over the board, including on the ship's funnel . The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the United States and Mexico. There are obvious signs of rust and old age everywhere but it is supposed to be a luxury ship on his maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow-capped peaks of the South Island of New Zealand, for God's sake! It was very cold on the USA / Mexico region! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I think the New Zealand taxpayer contributed to the production costs of this film, which was a waste of money better spent on real production. I know New Zealand high school students who could make better movies with their mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with a tag and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the truck door, probably to give the impression that it was American. But part of the panel is above the markings - you might think they would have noticed it in the accessories department before attaching it. I would love to continue, but it's definitely not worth it.
