This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie lover and have seen clips of this movie for months. Although I'm a little skeptical about the funny reality of this movie, my friends thought it was going to be great and made me angry. Then I went to see him and I fell asleep almost to sleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I was laughing at most of the things in the movie just so I did not feel bad and did not destroy the good mood I was in, and wanted to get my money's worth! I always go into a film with an open mind, without trying to do it with too many expectations, but this movie was not so funny. Now it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen a lot of previews for the movie or if you like very slow and lame comedies, you can enjoy it, but for true comedy fans, Id say pass. Maybe even re-check The Kings of Comedy. Something told me to go see Meet the parents instead !!!
