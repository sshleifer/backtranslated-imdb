VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured into a secluded country house inhabited by Two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) interfere in a free sex life, but his guests turn out to be vampires with a frenzied thirst for human blood ... <br /> <br /> lesbian cycle a vampire initiated by non-conformist director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, the bold shocking of Jose Ramon Larraz, VAMPYRES, pushed the concept of Adult Horror well Further than claimed by British privateers tolerated in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes of his original British release. It is not difficult to see why! Using his Gothic theme as a pretext for nudity, sex and bloodshed that the short film will allow, Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements to serve as backdrop to a languid meditation. about life, death, and sexual or other impulses that affirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a quaint country house in the fall of 1973, Harry Hämman creates in a haunting cinematography a dark atmosphere of dark presentiment, in which the desolate countryside - both dark and beautiful - seems foreshadowing an impending horror whirlwind (Larraz shot a similar turn earlier in the same year with SYMPTOMS, a discreet thriller that bursts into a violent frenzy during the final reel). However, despite its claims, the plot of VAMPYRES and its approximate production values ​​will divide the audience from the beginning. Although the two protagonists are as charismatic and attractive as one might wish, the male lead role (Brown, at the time of shooting) is unfortunately misinterpreted in a role that should have been attributed to a very handsome twenty-year-old male. Article not to be missed for moviegoers, curious curiosity for all the others, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Beware of the superstar of the silent era Bessie Love in a brief appearance at the end of the film.
