If this guy can make a movie, then I can do one too. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more nude women. This film did not have one. I think the class B horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the woman's body. I would not want to drop my audience. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from doing too many scenes where the hero wakes up to discover that it is only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, considering that the film only lasted an hour, the ratio of the duration of the film to the film was quite high. And if I decide to make a sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not rip any movie like Star Wars or Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to hide my contempt for big budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references to their subject in mine <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned him into an evil monster before the screen exploded or something like that. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinary.
