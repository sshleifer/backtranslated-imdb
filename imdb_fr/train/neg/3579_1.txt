Immediately after renting and watching this film several years ago, a friend and I decided that he was defining absolute zero on the scale of the film. Nothing in the film could have been worse than it was. To this day, we still evaluate the movies, even the worst ones, how much better they are than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the scripts for, among others, "Last Summer" and "The Diary of a Crazy Housewife" and she said that she was asked to write a screenplay for Harold Robbins' book The Lonely Lady. She said that she had sent a treatment that had been rejected because they did not think she understood the difficulties of a female writer in Hollywood. She then said, "I think they asked someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the release of the film. She died in 1981 and I bet the first thing she did when she arrived in heaven was to personally thank God for saving her from her involvement in the result.
