Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Ugly script and direction not too good either. My main problem was that I was not just dealing with these people. Not the killer, not the victims. The settings were pretty dull. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I did not care when the end came. He found his child. Big deal! I wanted to get my money back.
