It's as if a bad TV show from the '80s was gone and was trying to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god was it bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was nothing to say. Something about a stalker, I suppose. In the end he shoots himself? It's not really clear, but there is still a volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was there, and they ended up wanting to move quickly through the scenes with him, which were barely observable. Thank goodness, I did not spend money on that, but I want to find that time of my life.
