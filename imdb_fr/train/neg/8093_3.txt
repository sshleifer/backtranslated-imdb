Based on Tom Wolfe's satirical novel that has been hailed by everyone (I have not read it yet), Tom Hanks plays the role of a wall-mounted streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while he is lost in a bad part of New York. The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire, there are not many laughs either. is to see if her breasts change in size during the different parts of the film..This will avoid you other things like lack of script or humor .. On a scale of one to ten.3
