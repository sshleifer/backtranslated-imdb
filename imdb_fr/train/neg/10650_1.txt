This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen. And that says a lot, since I've already seen fucking ghosts like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which comes second). However, I like bad horror movies, and as you can see under my username, this one is really visible. There is sometimes nothing more entertaining than a slasher movie done badly. Regarding this film, the opening scene in which a woman is frying in a tanning booth seems to have no impact on the film, especially since the film does not tell you that the event s is produced 2 years before the rest of the film. The acting game is non-existent, and most of the shots are areas of women retracted in spandex. The policeman was the most monotonous, stone-faced actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this movie, however, must be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin ?! What were they thinking? Who is the killer? An employee "Huggies" dissatisfied? I should give this movie a total of zero, but damn if I did not have fun watching it
