PPV has just that. I do not want to waste too much time on this, because most of the posters here say it better than I could do it, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which was more funny: Redgrave chasing tiny moths and stumbling on his nurse; Close groans that her "precious" boy (whom she and the M had decided they were a drunken loser) was turned into a roadkill; that Ann, deaf and deaf, moved with Peggy Lee; or the horrible summary image of the guardian of the crypt, Annie, who looks at her younger! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danish as the young Redgrave. I also did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she'd better ask Mom to give her some lessons! I did not know why a girl (or boyfriend) ridiculed herself over the stupid Harris day stud! Ann's girls are as sibilant and thoughtless as she is, Luc is a lazy slacker on crack and I did not give any rot about them! The evening gives a bad name to Chick Flicks!
