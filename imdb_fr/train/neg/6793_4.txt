Filmmaker Richard Brooks, a wealthy and dusty westerner, seems totally engrossed in the genre while keeping intact all the usual clich√©s. The horse race of the early 1900s attracts a discreet cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave player (James Coburn), an arrogant kid (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMELLE (a surprisingly Candice Bergen game). Once the preliminaries are over (with the predictable arguments about whether or not a woman should participate), it becomes a pretty captivating entry, although it does not break any new ground (it looks more like something from the the time of Gary Cooper). Beautiful appearance, if the piece of great length has a macho verve and a beautiful cast, the mechanisms of the plot become tedious however. ** from ****
