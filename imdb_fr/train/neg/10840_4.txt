I happened to love the series growing up, with millions of others. So I watched this movie, thinking that if it was not good, it could be at least a little dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> FALSE! I just have to wonder, at the end of this, were Charlie's angels really so boring? I do not seem to remember it as such. But this film, as bad as films of this type may be, did not resemble the excitement of this period and this show. I saw everything, despite the inconveniences, it was not unassailable. But it was very bland, which I have nothing to reproach the performers, especially the women who played the angels as they really like them. The movie was just not interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is too fiery, we are the "good girl", we are in her husband ...), all the characters have been portrayed with a main characteristic defining them and little depth beyond the stereotypes. The excitement of the show was absent and the dialogue was ... dialogue. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But ratable.
