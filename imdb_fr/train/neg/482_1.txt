This is a French film, LOL, which focuses on girls with much older men. Why are the French so obsessed with this kind of thing? When the age difference is so great, she becomes really perverse! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she looks a lot like Olivia Hussey, of Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet in 1968, which takes place in a similar period), but she is about 15 years old and the actor who plays Tassi, her painting teacher, has the air ... well 50 is KIND. <br /> <br /> Other posters explained the historical narrative (exceptionally detailed in this case) of the true Artemisia, a great artist and one of the oldest painters of this period (17th century). Her story tells us about modern times, especially because of the age-old accusation that "all great artists were men" - she refutes almost all of this - and because the story of her rape trial is poignant. Not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because at that time, marriage to your abuser was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a serial rapist and had probably killed his wife and his child. <Br/> <br /> The film does a disservice in reversing this real-life story that is truly fascinating and remarkable - very dramatic and does not have to be "spicy" - because Somehow weird and frenetic, it is "hotter" to have an over-expressed teenager who draws male sex organs and has a love affair with a man old enough to be his grandfather. It's "sexy" - the truth is boring and seems too feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that this is ONLY Artemisia's life, considered interesting enough to be filmed. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of Judith decapitating Holfernes was painted AFTER, not before the rape), that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she then had children ... oh boring thing. After all, this is a middle-aged woman and they are not "hot" like teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is very creative to make a film (or a book) of a true historical character. You must create a dialogue, have subplots, create a dramatic structure. Some details may be sacrificed - it does not matter if the dates are moved a few years or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her own self-portraits that she was a brunette ... and a big one , not a skinny one), or something like that. But turning her story on her and raping a romance is actually sick and disturbing. It's even worse because the director is a woman. She should be horribly ashamed of herself! <br /> <br /> If you like that (and I know that some people make fun of the real female artist and just like the costumes and the hot sex), you will probably like "Dangerous Beauty" with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack. Similarly, based on a story strongly rewritten, with many breasts and goblets encrusted with jewels: Bon app√©tit!
