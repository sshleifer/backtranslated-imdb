I copy this on VHS, I think they (television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. In order not to forget what was and not to make the same mistakes. It's like putting people in the director's chair, where they do not belong. This film Rappin 'is like a vaudevillienne musical, for those who can not sing or play. This film is as much fun as trying to teach the "blind" to drive a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) has just been released from prison and is heading to the old neighborhood. By serving time for a ruthless crime out of necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by dogs, old ladies and peers as they dance and sing along the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if I was sentimental, or if in truth someone was smoking a pot of medication prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Anyway, it's a satire of life in the ghettos with the mischievous "hood", scripted, interpreted and even produced (I never thought I'd be sitting that way). Although I think the most classy part of the story, through gang fight sequences and dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to prevent the ghetto from being demolished and cleaned up. <br /> <br /> Forget about Sonny, Mario could have won an Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap. Oh, well, if you want to make fun of yourself and three quarters embarrassed, drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, look responsibly. (No stars, best luck next time!)
