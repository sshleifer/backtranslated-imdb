SWING! is an important film because it is one of the last films produced and performed by Black in the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated to the point of becoming unbearable, but this one is in pretty good shape. It's also a good opportunity to see many talented black artists from the period just after the heyday of the former Cotton Club - a period virtually forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is historically important. and has great performance, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the time - including a prima donna that will ruin the series and the unknown surprise that appears out of nowhere to save the day. However, the writing is just awful and a little trashy at times - and projects images of Black America that some might find a little humiliating. Indeed, before the plot really begins, you are treated like a tramp without a living account of his hard-working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is trapped (who, by the way , totally overlays this role), they have a fight that looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And a lady wants to cut the other lady with a razor, a trashy scene! Later in the film, when the prima donna behaves abominably, her husband hits her face and everyone applauds! It seems that the film sometimes wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator of the public, PLUS, they can not even do it well - with some of the worst actors I've seen for a long time. <Br/> <br /> Anyway, if you can look beyond a lousy production in almost every way (with trashy characters, misinterpretation and direction and poor writing), that It would be worth to be thrown to allow you to see excellent songs and taps ... as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's really, really bad!
