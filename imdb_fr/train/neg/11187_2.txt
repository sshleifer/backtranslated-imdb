Example two: At some point, priests need an answer to a question and only a demon (or something that now cares to have it) could provide it. How? Why, you must ask a dying man!

"Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "It's not nice!" would have been more realistic than their answer. They never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact, the closest reaction they get is a slight annoyance. They ask their question and leave. <br /> <br /> I had to shut up at that time, my brain was starting to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one out of four stars) <br /> <br />
