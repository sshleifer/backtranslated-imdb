The script was VERY weak, without enough arcs of characters so that you were interested a little in the characters or what happens to them. The script is far too talkative and not enough gore or action to call it even at a slow pace. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so they do not have to listen to them talk about this very mute and stiff dialogue. On a technical level, the mix of music is too high and it is difficult to understand what is being said most of the time. Again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have been better told in a short film of less than 30 minutes. The homage to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been nice if they had been more subtle, but here they look more like a bald-faced scam. Come on, what kind of budget 35mm and THIS is the best that could be done? Nevertheless, the cinematography, the lighting design and the plans were very well done.
