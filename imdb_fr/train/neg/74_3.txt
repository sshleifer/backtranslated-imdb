They built this one as a kind of fantasy. Man from Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and Sundance's kid. Just for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe play with high-class talent, bored young women of rich and older. OK, there are a lot of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well-documented facts, leaving room for artistic creativity to produce a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, nor the Arthurian legends, nor Beowulf, nor a person whose life is so enveloped by the haze of many past centuries that any recreation of their life and times is a 99% guess. There are only a few lives. My own grandparents were already old enough to go to school when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous to think that this movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The Real Story of the Kelly Group", I was looking forward to it being in the same vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's well-mocked Kelly of 1970 was probably much closer to reality and a better film as a whole, which does not mean much to him. <br /> <br /> Happy it only cost me two dollars to rent the DVD! I'll give you 3/10, and that's only because some of the beautiful pictures of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
