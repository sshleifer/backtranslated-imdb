Too bad neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy have anything to say that is worth telling. this movie is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's film? Well, if you try to get them to take a nap, then maybe. It's only about 90 minutes of insignificant animals in the animal lips and biting jokes that are not funny. And the synchronization of the lips makes that the old films of Godzilla seem brilliantly made by comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy continues with a discreet and suppressed childbirth that is painful to live. Apparently, he's trying to change his old maniac, but what? In short, all the magic and wonders of the original 1967 version are lost in this reinvention, or anything else. A city wants to intimidate some creatures in the forest and blame them for doing bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things chained with stale jokes to an insipid conclusion without surprises without surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the movie '67. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
