That night, I was surprised by Showtime and was amazed at how much a film with such an interesting premise could become so terribly horrible. WHO IS YOUR DAD? stars Brandon Davis as Chris Hughes, an adopted high school student, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire bequeathed to him by his biological parents. Although the film may seem like a lot of fun, it's ruined by Andy Fickman's inept staging, a clich√© and predictable scenario, as well as a behavior that's even bad in terms video conference. Even the funny Count Charlie Talbert presents himself as a best friend in a surprisingly dreary performance. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and not funny rascal. 1/10
