I am so disappointed. This film left me with the feeling of wasting my time and my mental energy. This is Woody Allen's film par excellence: the neurotics of the upper class Manhattanites discuss whether they will cheat with their spouse. Woody, I have already seen these characters, I have already seen the scenario of you ten times. Where did your creativity go ??? You must open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are even more interesting and fun scenarios to which you can apply your brand of anxiety and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project, he does not do anything for me - because now I was expecting his old reserve man: the couple who gets tired and ends up cheat. Depressing and always the same, always the same. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win back his fans, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not insulted.
