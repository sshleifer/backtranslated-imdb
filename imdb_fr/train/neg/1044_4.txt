"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those clear and familiar movies that you can watch and do the crosswords of the N.Y. Times at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you do not have to "pause" the DVD. Forget it, because you will not miss anything important. No twists, turns or tensions. It's not really an ethnic film, it's a film about a family of poor and struggling immigrants who happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It makes very little difference. I have seen everything zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish, Italian, Black or Irish family. The accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was called Bush or Clinton and was Presbyterian, the movie would have been a movie of sum. <br /> <br /> It is funny to note that the critics could not specify the locale. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some from the Bronx and another from Brooklyn. As a New Yorker forever, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family had never met anyone other than Latinos. They lived in a small isolated / isolated enclave. Some interactions with non-Latin Americans may have generated some enthusiasm, interest or tension. Do you remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now, let's move on to cinematography, so often criticized. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the shots inside seemed to me very orange. The apartment, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What was it supposed to mean? And the apt. looked pretty cramped for me. Someone here mentioned that the old apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What the owners have done is divide a large apartment into two or three very small apartments and bring in as many immigrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And another boring thing ... This is the second family film I saw and criticized this week featuring a "wobbly" teenager. Is this private sexual act necessary for us? Please spare me! What's new with these administrators? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice to see the young Latin American actors being given a break and a chance to show off their talents, which they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat and unspectacular script. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "fast forward" button.
