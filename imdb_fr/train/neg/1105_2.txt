Oh my. How can they make films of such beauty, but which are terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do shit like that. There is not even the slightest idea of ​​a decent story, multilayer characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of useless chatter together to make a "movie". I guess only children under the age of 3 can enjoy it, because the world is so small and the story is so inconsistent that any older person would be embarrassed. But again, it's far too scary for the under 6s, that there is probably no one who should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and stay away, far away from this film. Your little girl can make a better screenplay, and although she may not be able to draw such pretty pictures, her stories are worth listening to. And please, in the name of whoever you believe, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I'll give you 2 out of 10, and this is exclusively for graphics, because the character's story and development are so horrible that they would deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to look at it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
