"Magnolia" is an absurd and confusing dramatic showcase that does very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a series of episodes without aim, without any concern of coherence. The camera scrolls through the corridors and corridors, catching sight of sad characters. Where is the reason to take care of these people? The common theme seems to be that of people who scream a lot, who can not care for others (with the exception of the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and are self-destructive jerks that fall apart or fall apart. die. I remembered how much I did not like "Shine" because of the irremediable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive and unattractive characters here, why would we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> That said, nothing prevents us from talking about "Magnolia". Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed on his canvas. There are two ideas in particular this bomb. Both occur in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One with the camera rocking from one character to another as everyone sings one of Aimee Mann's folk songs. Sweet, but ineffective because we do not see what binds them all together. The other idea I am referring to can not be revealed otherwise than to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a lot of talent for acting. In particular Tom Cruise unleashed a performance that I did not know he had in him. And John C. Reilly is perhaps the most decent and the best cop of all time. But all that does not matter. When an unexpected and secret event occurred, a girl behind me in the theater could no longer hold him back and said, "That's stupid!" My feeling is that the majority of moviegoers will agree.
