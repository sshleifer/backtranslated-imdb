SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's as simple as that. There is not a quality that redeems about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite delicate - they actually lead you to think that this film will be shocking and that it will put you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes beating yourself while watching stolen and ill-done scenes unfold without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their advanced teleporting powers, for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake (drunk), then finds himself on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon has presented a pitiful performance in the role of Kate, aggravated by the break-off dialogue between the space-time continuum that seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth leveler. An example of this would be when she said, "flashlight!" in such a stupid way that it shows how much a human body can shake before breaking in two. Finally, the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and the most horrible I have ever seen. It was as if the cameramen were a group of chimpanzees to whom scientists had given camcorders. An example of this would be when we suddenly have a close-up on the headlight of Alex's car. I bet that the editing of this film was not long. The end was absolutely pathetic. The authors were obviously trying to create a kind of mysterious plot that would force the viewer to say, "Oh yes!" Instead, we still have to see a silly painting of a spider that fits into the story. Unfortunately, there is not a single prospect among millions of people who could save this film from dirt. <br /> <br /> I give him a .5 out of 10, the. that this film was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book.
