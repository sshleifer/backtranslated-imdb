This film must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD! The scenario might have clicked if the film had more funds and writers who would cut the absurd scenes and sickly on which I strongly warn parents .... But the scenario is like a cowardly cannon. If there had been such a thing as a film reader, it would have come out. It reminded me a lot of the fast-paced movies that were staged in the 1960s, poor writing and screenplay. <br /> <br /> The only sensitive characters in the whole film are the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the film could easily have been made by college students. I give this movie a rating of 1, because it is really awful and leaves all my family with the feeling of being cheated. My advice: do not look at it !!!
