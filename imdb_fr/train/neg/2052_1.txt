This waste of time is a totally useless remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added except Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary meaning of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. The precise soundtrack of Quincy Jones, which added a lot to the original film, is also sorely lacking. I can not understand the best grades for that at all. It's bad enough. Why is someone wasting time or money doing shit like this and why did I waste time watching it?
