It's an interesting idea that went wrong. The hidden meanings in art left in the form of clues by a serial killer seem intriguing, but the execution of "Anamorph" is extremely slow and of little interest. There is no other way to describe the film if it's not boring. Death cues are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". All that connects them is tedious. As an investigator, Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance, but he has little to do with a scenario too tense. Several actors of secondary characters are lost, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a medical examiner, and notably Deborah Harry, who is on the back of the DVD some lines spoken through a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
