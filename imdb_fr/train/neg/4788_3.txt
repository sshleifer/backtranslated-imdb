In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue the hunt for Tall Man, assisted by a 9-year-old boy with easy trigger, a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, because black comedy and gore is much less inspired and exciting than in Phantasm II. I had the impression that the focus was simply on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his acting talent. The humor of the previous movie was much drier and oppressed, which is better suited to a story like this one. In addition, the settings are not as macabre here, and the constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious ?? There is still a lot of gore but not as satisfying this time. By the way, beware of the very small version as it displays the most delicious murders on the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the work of Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes to date - the fifth being in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror treat of gore and violence and the rest can be easily ignored. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros has described his character in Phantasm II much better.
