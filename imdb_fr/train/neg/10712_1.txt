This is without a doubt one of the worst movies of my life, I insisted, I never did. Worse, my old Dolph hero is in the movie and stars it. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good but the way it unfolded hurt even my body. The fight scenes for beginners are about as choreographed as the fight between two drunks struggling in the gutter. The actors, except Dolph who fears a little too, play so badly that one can not help wondering if the reason for their presence is that they are all friends of the director, who also had to be absent most, all the time. That's $ 12 million unimaginably spent, because the effects and the landscape, the cost can not be more than $ 1,000.
