This film was particularly good for me because it had such a good principle: the friendship of three women, one of whom had fallen in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all attracted by extreme caricature, do not really support each other and conspire and manage to be dropped. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do nothing wrong in my book before seeing this, but here they are given a lamentable scenario and asked to balance the action between slapstick and screwball , which does not work very well when women are all well-known professionals in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for smart women spend a lot of time lamenting the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I thought a lot more could have been done with a decent scenario and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those women who smoked / drank (all three in their forties ???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - See the baby, give me a cigarette! Yes. As I said, it's a shame. 4 out of 10
