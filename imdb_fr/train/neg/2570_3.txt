I read that "There is a girl in my soup" came out during Peter Sellers' low period. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Apparently, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film. it's not. The whole movie seems to have turned randomly what happened without writing anything in a script. I may not have seen all the movies about middle-aged to elderly people trying to become hippies, but this one gives them a bad name. much better movies than this, so do not waste your time on it. Pretty worthless.
