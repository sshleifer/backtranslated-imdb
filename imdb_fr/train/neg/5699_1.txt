WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I do not have to pay money to see this horrible film. it was as if a story went from a frenzy of coke! The glimpses of it looked decent but it was REALLY bad I'll say the idea seemed decent, but come on. it was really bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would also realize that it was unrealistic. Come back in the day, you think they had all this equipment to work. It was not like Ben Franklin had sat down one day and made a fucking riddle. it was completely ridiculous, and if you want to see a bad movie, then go see this one. All the movie HORRIBLE, it could actually be on my top 10 of the worst movies of my life.
