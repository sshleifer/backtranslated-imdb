Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in girls' costumes from space. <br /> <br /> I like 50 sci-fi movies and even 50s fiction movie movies, but this movie is really, really bad. And not in the way of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Practically unassailable while two bozos make their best impression of Abott & Costello's "trendy cat". <br /> <br /> A cheese cake usually saves fi cheese, as in "Cat Women On The Moon" but that can not be in this case. This film requires a mute button and a fast forward function. <br /> <br /> That said, I could watch Gloria and Dolores wander the space ship for about an hour or so.
