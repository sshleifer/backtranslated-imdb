"The man in the attic" is a movie taking place in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, this story really does not need to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people responsible for the packaging of the film did their best to make this film look hot and erotic. They use terms such as "unlawful passion", "forbidden connection" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (Little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a rifle! <br /> <br /> The story is about Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unfortunately married to a man who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's business. Krista and Edward eventually fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The so-called "shocking" part of the film is as follows: Krista's husband discovers the affair and forbids them to see each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up making Edward live in their attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. And so on. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not cover any new territory. This is an original image of Showtime, which explains why the stars are two actors in list B and they both appear briefly in the belly. <br /> <br />
