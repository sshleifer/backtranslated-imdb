I just did not like this movie. But then, I loved Babe, a pig in the city, and I was spoiled by talking animal movies that are exceptionally well done in every respect. The animals were not friendly. They were all annoying, especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but what can I expect is Chris Rock. I think I have smiled once or twice at a few pretty lines, but that's all.
