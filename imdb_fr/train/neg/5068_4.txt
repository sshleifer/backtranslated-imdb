I am stunned to discover the number of fans of this show. Did not say that Friends was, at best, an "average" sitcom, and not as great as others. Let's face it, if there had not been the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows if this show would have lasted as long as he did. I highly doubt it. Although the series is progressing, Friends has become progressively more predictable, lame and boring than I mocked the characters, who are the most overrated in the history of television, nor their plight, nor who slept with whom . And this has gone from being funny during the first four seasons to sometimes becoming funny. And even when there were all those Hollywood stars in the film world, I still did not bother to listen. The writing in Friends became obsolete and I lost interest in this show from the sixth season to the end. The least we can say is that it was predictable. <br /> <br /> What was annoying was that it lasted ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons for example and were eventually canceled. removed from the air for good. The series should have stopped immediately when the casting wanted higher wages. In truth, as long as the series has weakened, it is the series that has been bigger than the actors themselves, and not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. We are now talking about a reunion show with friends on our TV screens very soon. And yet, for my part, I will not wait any longer.
