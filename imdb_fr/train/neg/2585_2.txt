It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does this have almost nothing to do with other American Pie movies, but the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> The girls are nice though, but spending your time looking at a cheap cheap porn might be better than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex ad, made for an audience under 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I have never been to an American college, but I seriously doubt that anyone who does it can really laugh at the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save time, do something else.
