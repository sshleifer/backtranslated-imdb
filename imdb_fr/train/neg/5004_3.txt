Wow, it's ironic since this movie has been out for some time now, I think someone else just JUST examined it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie just because it has Nick Stahl, for recording. <The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me crazy, they were so clichÃ© and STEREOTYPED. This film had the worst dialogue I have ever heard. There were too many twists in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is ONE scene in the movie that is worth seeing, but this one: "Heart warm, cold weapon" where Nick Stahl kills the unpleasant girl in the shower. (In fact, they were all odious.) But his role in this scene was excellent. The look on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie, treat yourself and do not look at it.
