Hanna-Barbera aspires the life of another famous property. The violence is diluted, the stories are stereotyped, the animation is bad, the music is odious and repetitive, and frankly, the show is just not funny. <br /> <br /> At the time, HB has staged everything from his series through the same situations of clich√©s, whether or not the world of cartoon. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and Flinstones are popular - assemble them and you can not miss them!"). In addition, in an apparent scam of "Soldier Benjamin", Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that presents them as new recruits to the army. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> The public service announcements of each episode (common practice at the time for cartoons, but still boring) add to the annoyance factor. Popeye explains to his nephews how to cross the street safely, recycle it and - are you ready for it? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I'm not inventing anything.) <br /> <br /> The only remaining charm of the original caricatures is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's early voice, continues the role here. <BR /> <br /> It's worth checking once to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
