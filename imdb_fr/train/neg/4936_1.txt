I lost my time and gave this show a chance. It must be one of the worst new shows. If they have given a prize to the shows that fear, this one should sweep the category. The acting is mediocre and the scenario is artificial. Now, the dinosaurs were a bit strange but at least it was fun. This show lasted three seasons and was finally removed. This new show, based on insurance company advertising, is not funny and has nothing to envy. Perhaps the original ads and the number of times they have been repeated are still what is wrong with this show. It just happened on TV and we are already tired of seeing the characters of the "caveman".
