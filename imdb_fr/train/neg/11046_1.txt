It's probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad game, bad effects, bad plot, all bad. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg-friendly cat is presented, blurring everything. Malcom MacDowell had to make a payment at home, otherwise he should have sold himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how we can go from Clockwork Orange to that shit and be able to look in the mirror every morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity. The publisher must have been asleep or the drug is so bad. To act. Do they have to smoke to be bad ?? The gun fires blue flames or bullets, you decide. The wicked girl and the other girl in the movie are so alike that it's confusing Whay is called Seadly Wake 2013. It has nothing to do with the movie
