Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent far too much time creating the Hovis atmosphere and laughing Catholic demands. Then very quickly, the fascists and the socialists are fighting over the family's attention and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> My wife always thought Liam was cute.
