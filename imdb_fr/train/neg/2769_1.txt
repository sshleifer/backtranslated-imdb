This film is a timely warning for anyone who thinks they can write and make their own film. Look at it, you can not. Because in this way, no one can tell you that when you chop big holes in your plot, that you have insignificant transitions, banal and immutable dialogues, and that you manage to turn a pretty cool Korean legend into a jumble of celluloid. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, I really liked it; I like a lot of crappy movies. But once I was forced to ask myself what hell has just happened and why, God, why? more than a few times, I can not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I wish someone could explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
