Parasomnia has interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The actors are unconvincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who has played major roles in such films as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in his sleep (which is a little what he does here) The main problem is that the actions of the characters have no meaning. The story is rather boring and predictable with inexpensive computer effects mixed with bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better, I do not get good reviews about it. It's below average really.
