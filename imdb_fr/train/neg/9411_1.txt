It's interesting to note that everyone who (until now) seemed to like this movie had no expectations - I guess that's the thing. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations and it was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the camera was to faces, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateurish director - it's always a sign from them, they think it's artistic effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches from the actors. The actors in this film, however, each had only one facial expression. <br /> <br /> If the closed camera was not enough, the lack of light in the film had killed him. The film seemed entirely shot in the dark. We now know that the director of photography was also a lover of rank. "Ooh ooh, let's light the scene with a flashlight! It will make everything seem intimate!" No, it gave the impression that all this was invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to the serious technical problems, there was absolutely no story beyond the slightest hint of ideas ever developed, and nothing new to this type of relationship was illuminated. (This may be a new type of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won several film festival awards n ' does not indicate the quality of the film. film, but taint the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film will not win anything in the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film, it seemed like it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the filmmaker's "total darkness" technique ). But when the film shuddered, the audience groaned. And once the film was finished, DID was over, it was clear that it did not matter if the movie ended at one of the two previous moments. An earlier end would have saved the public from even more monotonous scenes of domestic life (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we understood that the life of the lonely old man was boring - but we had imagined it at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend to the public to miss out on this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated viewers.
