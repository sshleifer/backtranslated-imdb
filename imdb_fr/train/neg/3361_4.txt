This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made ,,,, it had everything to make a great movie. An incredible acting game, awesome special effects ...... oh, wait, I have to think of a good movie. Well, it was not one of them, it was just nil. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I voted, there were 206, there, god knows what happens in their head. Now, like any other vote, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie so good to give it a 10? I know it's the same 206 who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme was a great dramatic actor.
