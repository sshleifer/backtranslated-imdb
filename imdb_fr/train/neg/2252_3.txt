So I learned from a few people that this film made them cry at the theater. As I watched it for the first time, I was expecting another romantic and heartbreaking film by Barbra Streisand; Something like the way we were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to attach to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. The character of Streisand fell in love with an alcoholic addict who could not sing a single note without making me want to press the button fast forward. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about an unstoppable rock star and a woman who seems unable to realize it until her death. Parts of the movie seemed to be dragging along, and I was always wondering when it was going to end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was totally predictable. At the beginning of the film, his irresponsible behavior was quite obvious and at his death I felt no emotion. It was not a tragic accident, it was actually an idiot. Not to mention the length of the film, his hideous beard distracted me. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this film that are worth seeing are Streisand's songs. The end of the film when she sings "With another look at you / Watch carefully now" was the reason why I gave this film a huge 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the film where I felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.
