Of course, he had some of the qualities of a good movie. The scenario is good, even if it's a bit bland and the acting is enough but I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the United States. My biggest problem, though, was with the wardrobe. I know that, as a rule, the average American is considered a badly fussed dresser by any self-respecting European, but it went beyond that. Anna's color schemes were really horrible !! And that sad, bag-shaped excuse for a coat she wore all through the movie made me burst into hives. I guess the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many teachers to walk around Prada?), But simple does not mean absolute lack of taste. A word for the wise ...
