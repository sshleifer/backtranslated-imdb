Expecting a combination of science fiction and vintage films on Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computer science, etc., I was disappointed by this senseless pseudoscience of the film and its mix of real and fabulous story. This gives the impression that her writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of mathematics, technology, or story making up the subject of the film, but instead works from some sort of print fuzzy artistic. It strikes me a lot because I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glean and terribly abuse scientific terms and ideas to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "The waves of information have a half life, "Ada:" I'm not at all certain that a half-life is better than no life at all. " <br /> <br /> This film is worse than not entertaining - it disinforms itself. The only value that redeems me, I can imagine, is that it could attract the viewer on the subject that it distorts so much. I think it is more likely to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology indicating that a degree of advancement is indistinguishable from magic.
