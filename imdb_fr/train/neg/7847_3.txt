Just recently, I was so obsessed and anticipated by this film that I almost had to see it. Well, having seen it today, the score of 5.8 is quite understandable. I think if you anticipate something so much that it becomes an urgent need, it turns out not to be worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its highlights. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that fits well with the product itself, but it's all so complaisant that it becomes so hard to follow. And if there had not been Wes Craven's production on this film, it would not have anything to do with The Original Remake. <br /> <br /> But all of this makes you say, "Is it supposed to be horror or comedy?" because there are a lot of ridiculous, randomly placed jumping moments and dumb linings ("There's a hand in the sh! uh!" or "You, my dad, uh! I'll kill you all those damn son of b ** chess! ") and the acting game (God does not even remember how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, beware! ) The film starts with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!), Then the screen goes black with the title of the film and a monologue, then we go to this office where there are veteran mannequins We find that it is for this scientist who keeps track For those who are looking for mutants, the box for monitoring audio streams has disappeared and everyone dies! After this opening, you expect more. <br /> <br /> We then move to this team of army recruits training in Baghdad while the captain introduces them "A good job at stupidity", their last day of training is spent in New Mexico, the desert where the family was left to use they were stuck. During training, things finally go bad, people die and ... should I tell you more? Because at the moment, I have the attention of a goldfish that forces me to sit here typing this. <br /> <br /> The problem with THHE2 is that it simply does not work. No flashback here, and the end is pretty safe ... but with a twist! A stupid one is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will illustrate all its alternatives, but for the moment, I'm not sure I care. <br /> <br /> So by all means, if you loved the first THHE so much, it's almost a sin not to see it, then to see it. But otherwise, then, avoid at all costs. It's for your good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
