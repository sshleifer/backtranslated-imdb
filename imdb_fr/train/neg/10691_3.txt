I quarreled with myself about whether to rent this or not. I'm always afraid to praise something I have never heard of (I do not remember being in theaters). Big distribution ... that's what made the difference. After 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching him. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It only gets worse after that. The authors of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to improve their film a bit more. Or they could just try to write something a bit believable. I give him a 3 ... a 1 for writing (only because there are words) and a 2 to be able to get as many good actors that they agree to make this movie despite reading the script. Oh my god, this movie is bad.
