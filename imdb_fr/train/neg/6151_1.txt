... and by no means as clean, logical and understandable as on the picture in this pathetic sum of tired Hollywood clichés. <br /> <br /> I'm 27 years old and I've spent 16 years battling delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character of the film, I was successful mainly because of the logic: because I thought constantly to move away illusions from reality and to know what was happening and what was not happening . In the end, I really did it because of the drugs, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before taking a medicine the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> Then, I feel entitled to tell you that this film is a total fraud. Not only does this deceive with the story of the main character (who was not loyal to his wife, who was bisexual - something very important here), but most importantly, he shows a comforting and tamed vision of the schizophrenia - which totally misses the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not * a "normal man with a disease", he is a man who sees and feels things differently from most people: for him, things like time, space and people's personalities are not solid things. He thinks it can be curved, that it can change, that it can mutate and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world, to which "normal" people do not expect - but he is trapped because he can not communicate with most people, and his world becomes poorer and poorer until he has ended in an empty and illusory stalemate. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is described in this ridiculous "cure", a heartbreaking film. This should be violently scary. People other than the main character must look strange, strange and absurd, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead," for example. There should be some really impressive hallucinations, strange and gross, because that is what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look at "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read PK "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik" from Dick, look at "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", " Dark City ", or play" American McGee's Alice "on PC, and you may have a vague idea of ​​what it is. . Do not watch this month's "Do It Right" movie, with mundane situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid stuff. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and inner coherence - he's violent, strange, confusing and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, schizophrenia is not about more details, it's not a neat and tamed trick. It jumps you in the face and will not let you go: the walls collapse, people transform themselves into strange hostile creatures, you have the impression to go back in time, you are not sure of who you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is more than what this soap melodrama describes
