I saw this film in the middle of the night, as I ran through the channels and there was nothing else to watch. It's one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after about twenty minutes that you can not turn it off, no matter how serious the situation. One of those movies that's somewhere in between is so good and it's so bad, it's just BAD, it's worth seeing, just to experience the confusion of realizing that is both! Excellent mid-night rate, if only for the fabulous tennis trail. Do not even worry about why no one can say that Chad Lowe is such an obvious man, because logic does not apply.
