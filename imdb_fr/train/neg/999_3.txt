I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a huge disappointment. Disappointed because the scenario was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate film was exciting and, being a fan (it sounds perverted, I'm not!) From movies of 'rape / revenge' years 70, I was very curious to see this movie. My conclusion: stick to classics! Yes, the scenario has potential but the dialogues are flat, the actors unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it's a fair representation of the academic world in the United States, that the emptiness of the characters makes sense and all that jazz, but that it makes the whole film without substance. Just like the scene where Dawson is raped: it is seriously lacking intensity! I did not expect anything irreversible, but are not we supposed to feel compassion for her? I did not have a minute, she was so lame until the end ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, that's good, but nothing innovative either. I have to admit that the screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something, but at the end of the film, I could not help thinking, "I want to look at new "Inferno" Argento. lol. More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully filmed and all, but I had the bitter feeling of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the foul bar near the Canada-US border in "Twin Peaks" - Lynch's' Fire Walk 'with Me' ... the raw red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the lascivious / decadent general atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie. Pity.
