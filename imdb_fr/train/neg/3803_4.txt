The film seems disjointed and globally poorly written. The scenario goes as if 10 different people had written it and none of them were communicating with each other. Apparently, they wanted to take a page of a Miracle movie on 34th Street (the original), but it's done so poorly that the film falls apart. This movie is for only the very young, and even they will see the fact that whoever scriptures it knows little or nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels are in the last row, the owner does not seem to care and he is not disturbed by the fact that his manager has just argued with his pitcher. On the word ?? or that he hit the team's game as an advertiser on live television. However, when the team is at a division victory game, it is distorted by a story (told by a 6 year old child) that the manager receives help from a child who claims to see real angels . What seems worse? A losing and out of control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or a winning coach at the edge of the playoffs who acts a bit eccentric and helps children in foster care? The owner's reaction is meaningless. And he was led to change his mind by Maggie and his speech "straight out of a clich√©" at a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The Angels are expected to play for the Division in the last weekend series against the White Sox, but at the end of the match, the announcer continues to say that the Angels won the pennant. "The pennant is not decided before someone wins the league championship, not the division title of the regular season. <br /> <br /> - Whitt Bass, the stupid pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the losing streak of the Angels (??) when it is the starting pitcher DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is declared in the ninth round to have played 156 shots, In a low-scoring game, in low-scoring games, the number of throws is MUCH lower than this, usually around 80 to 90 pitches. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL", declares the angel at the end "The championships must be won individually", even though he and his angels have handled and repaired throughout the dry season wave half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, because there are MANY other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years old), this movie can be fun. Too bad ?? well done it could have been a classic. It hurts like that and it's a forgettable mess that will live forever like a UHF / cable washout on Saturday morning.
