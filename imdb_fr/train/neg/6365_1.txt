Wow, I knew this movie was going to be bad but not so bad. Spoileric comments ensue. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a clumsy retired policeman (a cliché!). His adoptive son returns from the "Special Ops" of the armed forces and because he "saw things" - he is represented by gritting his teeth if someone says something of the past. It's time to clean the streets of another guy who has already known Piper and his dead son (whom the bad boy has killed) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love is a pretty young woman who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the old type of army. This happens in about 2 minutes of a scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this film, but it's even worse than the script and acting. Everything has been done before, everything has been done much better (Ong-Bak is a great example). It's the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Uh, the movie is called HONOR (spelled badly for Americans) and the slogan is "from the producers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - check out director David Worths and you'll quickly understand why they have put these two movies there, even if they are over 10 years old. Classics such as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - really says it all. <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you're not going to see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Excuse yourself for not knowing the names of the characters, but tell you something.
