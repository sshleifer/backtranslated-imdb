I did not expect anything other than being entertained for 90 minutes and that's exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's campy, of course, some dialogues were not perfect, of course, the special effects "were a little hokey.That's exactly why I liked it so much This is a perfect choice for this kind of horror classic from the 70s. <br /> <br /> Talent must start somewhere, for actors and crew, and what better material to sharpen your skills that. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another film from these producers and directors.
