Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the intrigues are only getting worse. The scenario was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, he is sometimes stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the most idiotic character in the series. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter-in-law, but it was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first shows were a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do an excellent job. I do not know how these shows play so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored like me and have nothing else to watch, I'd advise you to watch this.
