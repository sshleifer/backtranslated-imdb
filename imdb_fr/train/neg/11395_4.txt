Not quite a new story, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) continue to meet by chance and wonder if they are made for each other. Although both are promised to others ... oddly enough, they always feel that their soul mate is somewhere. A little sullen in some places, but lived the love. Being romantic, I almost have to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The final is almost too sweet, but the most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but which, in hell, could not be hit by Beckinsale. Outstanding support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role in which I have ever seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Look at this with your soul mate.
