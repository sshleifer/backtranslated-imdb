What can I say about this movie other than "do not see it". I waited and waited and EXPECTED that something is happening (or anything) and it just does not come. Watch incredibly two people stroll while setting the record for most screen filling times in a single movie. What are they doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they gathering clues? It may be difficult to say. At the end of the film, after the decoding of a large number of radio signals (illegibly on a kind of PET monitor) and the presentation of lectures, the plot is finally revealed and discarded as quickly as possible. Some extraterrestrials want to find the utopia of their home world and are so happy that they want to blow the earth (I guess they do not like to share the wealth). I guess they finished shooting and saw their work or their 35-minute piece of art (garbage!) And decided to let the editing crew turn it into an 88-minute feature film. Look at your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
