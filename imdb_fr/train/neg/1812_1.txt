Go right now and rent this movie. It will be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered with dust. Nobody will have touched it for years. It can even be a $ 50 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many movies that can be compared to that - the celluloid version of this sticky substance that forms in a garbage can after a few years. Yes, I gave him a '1', but he really deserves a lot lower. Scales 1-10 have not been designed with this in mind.
