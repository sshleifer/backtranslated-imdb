There are movies that are awful, and there are some that are so horrible that they are considered long forgotten and unstoppable. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just cheese stuff, you know what I mean) also add to the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such torrid content? Why, "Final Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this movie. Joel and the Bots performed it in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now, this time, while Mike takes Joel's place in the Satellite of Love (but with the same robots), this trio must make fun of MST3K's second movie, Joe Don Baker, "Final Justice". Of course, a lot of the naughty stuff I mentioned was removed for broadcast on TV, but I still want to watch this episode (and "Mitchell" too), because what does Joe Don hate? " most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check this store for the uncut strip! LOL It happened to another user!
