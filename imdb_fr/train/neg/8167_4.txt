The Forest is not just your usual cannibal menu of slasher / backwoods, it also contains an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story tells the story of two couples who go hiking in the forest. A troglodyte dwelling, cannibalistic loggers and the ghosts of his deceased wife and two children quickly terrorize them. There is something you do not see all the slasher. The director Don Jones gets an "A" for the effort although the film itself falls flat pretty much at all levels, the acting is simply average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead woodcutter's wife (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). <Br/> <br /> The film begins with some beautiful shots of a couple walking in a valley and in a forest. They realize too late that someone is harassing them. They are both shipped in the typical slasher fare. Our murderer uses a faithful hunting knife throughout the film, except during a flashback when he uses a hand saw, a fork and a rusty saw blade to send the lover of his wife unfaithful . <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story, but the movie just does not work with it. I found it rather boring with a simply rotten acting game. 4/10
