It was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've seen. It did not stand out at all, really. Regarding the cards, I thought it would be very good, but each match seemed to fail. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the best games. Benoit wore it. I just did not think MVP was that good, but Benoit saved that game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys do not get along well. Or maybe Khali and any other living person do not get along well. Terrible match. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley I'm not a fan of women's wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst match of the MITB to date. Just a major disappointment, for many people in the ring at the same time. It just did not live up to it. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker It was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good to change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really think this game deserved to be the last. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm getting tired of seeing Cena win every game. It's getting a little old. Now I have to say, I think this match is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs' Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the evening and most other games were short.
