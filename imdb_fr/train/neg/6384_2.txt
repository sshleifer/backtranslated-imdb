I was recently online watching a site that featured public domain films. This film was part of their long list of films and I thought I had to hallucinate in an offensive title and premise. But no, that's really what it was. And since the film only lasts about 27 minutes, I decided to try it. If it turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team attempted, with a budget of around $ 49, to shoot a Star Trek-style film on a team of very gay men traveling across the galaxy, eliminating the oppression of women by killing all women - as they had done before. Earth! And in any case, they were greeted by the applause and thanks of the now homosexual men on the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, this is not the case. With some of the most obscene and juvenile character names I've ever heard, I do not even think I can write them on IMDb without my comment being deleted! However, despite the fright of all this, he was strangely observable and deserved a glance. But, as I already mentioned, because of the rudeness of the names and the strange object (but not nudity), it is an adult movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions about WHO would do that, WHY do it and WHO was the target audience ?! It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the most bizarre and perhaps the most shocking!
