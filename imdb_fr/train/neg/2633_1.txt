I saw the movie trailer several times at the theater and I got excited. It looked like a classic thriller like in the 1990s. It also reminded me of the Fugitive movies, a cat-and-mouse hunt between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see it, a lot of people say it sounds like a TV movie. Not exactly. First, there are many more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies can sometimes be very funny, but this movie is the opposite of a good time. It's not stylish at all visually and most importantly, the tone of the movie is unattractive. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consisting of a chase and a clash. Plus, these are not big action scenes, but the worst is that these action scenes are very tasteless, just like the movie. The love story between Douglas and Bassinger was very useless. In addition, the assassination plot against the president is the most clich√©d story of its kind, but they insist on this point. And it's not a movie about the cat and the mouse as it is supposed to be. Although Douglas is very old, he still has the potential to play in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a bad choice either, because it seems to look at Jack Bauer and his character is one of the reasons that make the film look like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course, it is too passive or directly in this movie because she is a soap opera star. The movie was not fun, even a second for me, so I could not stop for a moment.
