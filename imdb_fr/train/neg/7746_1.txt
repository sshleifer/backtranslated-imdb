All aspects of this low-budget science-fiction film literally fall into categories that have been classified for its predecessors, contemporaries and followers. Bad special effects, a weak story, ridiculous amounts of blood and blood, boring and useless characters, everything you can expect. "Attack of the Sabretooth" is about a new resort where owners are genetically building Smilodon cats to attract them. The cats escape and start killing people, the show manager wants to save them and not warn unsuspecting visitors about them. <br /> From the point of view of special effects, the film is an average achievement given its budget. The saber teeth are represented through a poor synthetic image. Surprisingly, however, cats look more realistic in a close-up and detailed rather than in longer and more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are insensibly bloody and unpleasant. As you can imagine, they attack, tear arms and legs and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film sinks into poor schlock. <br /> <br /> The plot and the characters are just as horrible. We have college students who come to the island and plan a treasure hunt. And take it very, VERY seriously. Even to the point of encroaching on private property, tampering with security systems and stealing. Why do they take a simple game so seriously? Have I missed something? Was there money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, I could hardly follow the movie. But it seemed to me that they were only doing it for the pleasure of doing it. Despite this, they went too far for normal. <br /> <br /> "Attack of Sabretose" is a very bad movie. Even for a low-budget science fiction movie, it's a very poor and inexpensive example. This will appeal to most viewers, could be attractive to some and will make you laugh and laugh all the way through. And keep in mind, it's not a comedy, it's a cheap horror movie, so it's not supposed to be comic.
