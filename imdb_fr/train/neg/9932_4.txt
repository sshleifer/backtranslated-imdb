Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent film B actor who made a lot of black look-alikes in the 1940s, can not do much with this one. when he is condemned to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with the help of the husband of the deceased wife. After a dazzling first shot, the film quickly settles into the B-movie formula. That sounds good, but the twist finish is colorless and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a little stiff. Based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich, and passable for a single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
