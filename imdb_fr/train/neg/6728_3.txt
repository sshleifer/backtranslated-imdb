This film is hardly good, not great at all. Some memorable scenes and the unlucky choice to associate Norma Jean with an actress. Jane Russell has all this work for her, the least Marilyn woman and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of his lame career. 3/10
