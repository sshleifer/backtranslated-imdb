Let me be really clear about this movie. I did not watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for the delirious sex scenes. That being said, this film is so horrible that I switch between the sheer joy of seeing Traci's divine body (Mandy Schaffer) and uncovering the disaster of a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The The first scene of the movie had already made me shudder .. you see a woman paint something on the lake, in a pure and serene happiness, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if she could paint next to her. When they are both finished, they show what they did ... and the woman painted a vineyard when she faced the infrared lake. What kind of director of Screwball would make this kind of mistake ?? And in another scene, Traci has to kill the lover of his teacher by breaking him with the sailing stick, then she swims and none of the policemen of the city has suspected him once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DOES NOT HAVE A GLOVE? His fingerprints are everywhere on God's boat! After that, the situation gets worse, whenever Mandy is present, there is a "chilling" sound effect that looks like a cat in shape. It's also a shame that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I'm really sorry for her to have to play in this super-economical soft porn. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to play in this film. In total, 2/10.
