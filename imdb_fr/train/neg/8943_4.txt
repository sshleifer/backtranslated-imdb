John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in Indian territory and Martha Scott's attention in Republic Pictures from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting western because of its characters and its more modern setting, with Wayne & Dekker playing old and new factions of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-wrote the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell conducts in the most professional way that suits his career. A rather mundane story is actually saved by his last third, where fortunately the action resumes and we are treated to something that looks like a pulse. The light approach of romanticism is not quite right, and a glorious fight in the fist between the two protagonists is ruined by the impossibility of disguising the stuntmen who do the work. But hey, the stuntmen still deserve their hour of glory. George 'Gabby' Hayes is a strong supporter. Wayne, as usual, has a lot of charisma on the screen, especially when triggering his gun. But despite its budget better than usual, it remains an interesting movie only for fans of Wayne 1940. 4/10
