I do not particularly like remakes, nor to steal the modern jargon "stories", but this movie really pissed me off. The original Prom Night, although, in my humble opinion, was not a masterpiece, he still realized what it was ... the horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspense is crucial to maintaining public interest. Sorry people, but a white knuckle movie it was not! The alarms were not expensive and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of fear that has been done to clich√© an excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon after, but now an unexpected appearance of the villain of the movie). This movie did not succeed, so how could I expect it to respect one of the horror movie conventions? There must be a hero or a friendly heroine. This film does not have one. The person I identified most with was the detective in chief. His calm demeanor, but his unobtrusive approach to a murderer's escape was what more films of this kind should have. Common sense approach to the events that occur. (If you escape from an Ax branding psychopath, you head for the sprint in the opposite direction.) Do not jog, look back three seconds at observing the killer's progress, stumble on each limb and object inanimate on your path.) If your friend disappears, you do not seek him alone. And if you suspect a crime, you talk to someone, do not investigate yourself. These shots are tired and overjoyed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.
