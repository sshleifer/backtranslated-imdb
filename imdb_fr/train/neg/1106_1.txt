Do not waste your time on this mess. As described, the characters have no value that redeems and watching them interact is a real torture. "Gothic" was at least an entertainment, it's shit. If you like to watch pretentious and spoiled poets trying to outdo each other, this may be right for you. Lord Byron is described as a complete fool and it is truly astounding to know why others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character to have a spine, but even she comes out of this ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another top movie based on the same subject, but I did not understand the title. I was hoping that was it, but no luck. Not recommended.
