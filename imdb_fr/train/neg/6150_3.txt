I saw this movie with the intention of not loving it. I'm sure that it's not the case. This is one of those films that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music throughout the film in almost every shot, almost no profanation, unfolding in a bygone era, sepia color images, pretentious title, NO SEX and A genius who explains everything he thinks and concludes in SFX / CGI so that we (the stupid public) get it. One thing that amused me though was the fact that they spelled the NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (named after a person named Alfred Nobel) "the noble prize". Jesus! How can one make such an error in such a big production, supposedly based on a true story. What a sham! What did you and others think about RON?
