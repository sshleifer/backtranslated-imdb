Ten minutes of history lasted about two hours. When nothing important had happened mid-way, I should have left. But, still optimistic, I stayed. And left with a sense of guilt for having lost time. Playing was ok, but the scenario is so transparent and so weak. The scenario is about as lame as possible, but again, extending the ten-minute scenario leaves little room for a good dialogue.
