What is the most heartbreaking film ever made? The gynecological nightmare of 'Cries and Whispers'? Fassbinder acidic psychodrames? The disconcerting black comedy of "Last House on left"? I'm sure for this part of the movie-loving public that attaches its poles to the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer: none of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what has troubled me the most in this film - the grounding of Keaton's complex and expansive physical art to make it ridiculous; the painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with the dialogue - not that he does not have a beautiful comic voice, or that he can not make the dialogue funny; it's just that the studio does not seem to have given him enough shots, so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before playing, which only makes him - Keaton, not his character, silly; or is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton trapped in a riotous sexual joke while delivering some of the richest stories of romantic frustration to the movies? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was most disturbing: watch Buster Keaton, the greatest comedian in the movies, sit next to watch Jimmy Durante playing his role. These are horrors such as this one that causes Dantes to compose your hell. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have had the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to sound was to transform him into a Brother Marx, with verbal pedanticism, elaborate, tedious 'clowning', shambolic slapstick, theatrical scenery, triumph in chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton was just not that kind of comic book, and where Groucho's malicious language and merry opportunism might well have allowed this plot to work, Buster's socially inept teacher can not, he's too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to allow the experiment, like Lang in M, or Ren√© Clair; he would never have tried to hold the tide like Chaplin. When we refer to a movie like "The General" - playing with trains - the loss becomes even more obvious. <br /> <br /> And the problem is that, at times, the film is not so bad: there is an excellent jolt when a camera in the bus leaves Keaton alone in a station; and the denouement, hardly original, is at least more alive than it was before. There is something almost endearing in the way Keaton slows down a path that requires all the zip he can have. <br /> <br /> There is a film here about loneliness, the emotionally paralyzing order, the distressing effects of education, etc., which is struggling to come out. The best way to enjoy this film is not to look at Professor TZ Post's story, but at the emasculated Buster Keaton genius, trapped in a prison of mediocrity, baffled by new technologies, flouted by a malicious fate (here the studio), retaining a stoic grace. Looked like that, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
