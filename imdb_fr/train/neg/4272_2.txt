This kind of movies where a psychopath of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate completely) a naive person to take control of his life. The fatal attraction, Pacific Heights, the cradle hand, the white single woman, and a thousand television movies are just a few examples. But if a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, can offer at least some extremely paranoid and suspenseful characters or some twists, the illegal entry plays everything for the book. And without the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film would sink in mediocrity faster than a miniseries Danielle Steele. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessant, naive guy who calls two officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he discreetly avoids his anger with the bad cop (Ray Liotta), a typical psychopathic villain with no limit to his power. At first, sympathetic to Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops want Carr to get involved, destroying the lives of all types (which is pretty easy when you're a cop and when you're the cop who installed the guy's security system in his house) ) in order to take charge and probably, get his wife. It seems less focused on the end, and rather than the cop just wants to prove his power. In other words, the wife looks more like a trophy than an end. And since the story is played entirely in the book, you can probably predict each event before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main and naive character realizes that he is the victim of a credit card fraud (perpetrated by the evil psychopath) until the U-turn final - he is not really dead.
