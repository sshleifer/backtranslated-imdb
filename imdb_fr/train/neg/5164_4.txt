The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A woman does things big and returns to her alma mater to be worshiped. But, despite the good interpretation of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is messy. Joan Crawford or the director, or both, are responsible because his performance is simply horrible. Instead of being a real person, she miraculously imitates a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she looks in space and has an expression "damn it, I'm so stunned". After only a few minutes, it became really annoying for me. Now, it's certainly not the only Crawford movie that I do not like for her performance, as she did more than her share of exaggerated films - in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as that BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - there was certainly better.
