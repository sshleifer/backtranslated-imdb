"Surviving Christmas" is a great time that is almost worth it: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel over the stupid head of Ben Affleck. <br /> <br /> This film is another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini He is a great actor while robbing his career by playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Young and wealthy executive, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has been inculcated into believing that one must never be alone at Christmas. (And there, from the beginning, arises the fundamental problem of our suspension of disbelief in this silly film: how many people of the social status of Drew, in 2004, really care in one way or another that Christmas spent alone or with half of the family or with a prostitute at fifty dollars?) Storyline finds Drew buying a family to spend Christmas, provided they claim to be his, insensibly ignoring all the clues of the family. contrary, that his money did not buy the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), his suburban truck driver, and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to become Drew's ad hoc family, against the protests from them. his son Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and his daughter Alicia (a very concentrated Christina Applegate). Drew then passes the rest of the film to replenish his youth or something like that. The messages in this film are as distorted and illogical as his dry-mouth scenario. Struck with obvious psychoses, Drew has a fake smile on his face and remains blindly in denial against every bashing he allegedly bought from the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> What raises the question: If Drew is paying people to find a semblance of joyous family emotion, how psychotic must it be to claim happiness among their ardor and mental anguish of his presence? It's not true that the Valco family is hiding its true feelings and pretending to be happy as it rubs shoulders with Drew - three of the four members make it clear that they despise him. Is he so incognizant that he can not see that his money does not buy him the "family" atmosphere in which he was instilled in believing it was a truth in the first place? As with all such opprobrious films, one wonders how * four * writers could be so entangled in their own narcissistic dreams to appear in a sequence of credits that they will forget any semblance of plausibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, head of * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - stops there. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara manage to shine in one way or another, proving their courage in this mess. Christina Applegate is elegant, sweet, blonde and spirited in the right places. She cut Drew into thin strips of carcass for most of the film, then turned around and fell in love with him because the script told him to do it. And I would not go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider would do better to look over his shoulder. There is a whole new level of talent desperately looking for talent in the city.
