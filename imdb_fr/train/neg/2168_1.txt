Having read another review, I thought this movie would be really good. I like movies "B", but it can not even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only decent thing in the movie. But the writing left a lot to be desired. It was very hectic and staccato. Whoever chose the music and the sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, especially something atmospheric or decorative. If the game had been better, they could have removed the movie. Unfortunately, I saw better play in porn movies. If you want to see a vampire movie "B", take a look at "Bloody Links". You will be much more entertained.
