I missed the beginning, but I saw the essence. A friend got it on DVD in FYE's cheap room. <br /> <br /> The sketches are very short, but most of them are still too long. The majority of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something funny! A lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, stereotype-based sketches, or skits that use racist terms for people. and I have problems ... The Tunnel Vision Network logo is a one-eyed mouth in which there is an eyeball. The mouth opens and closes on the eye like eyelids. A little scary. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors have gone ahead, and it is fortunate that this bomb did not hold them back.
