I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least they try to be) and it must be the worst if not the second worst movie I have ever had to try to miss. I have never known the depths of Masacism before renting this piece of moldy cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I would have hoped for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for a minute and a half. the credits rolled and I had not seen what the pain was like. There may be viewers who have appreciated that and who can point me in the right direction, but again, I know viewers who understand if it's not to remind me, especially when we had to turn off the video and that is just not over with our monitoring (we had to make an exception of course). <br /> <br /> If this were to be done for a remake, I would give it a chance as long as they incorporate at most 1% of the original. That's all.
