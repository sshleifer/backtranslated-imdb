Revolution is a terrible movie. No matter if you are a history teacher, news writer, Al Pacino fan, it's impossible for this film to earn a legitimate "10". <br /> <br /> The key Tom Dobb (Al) seeks money through a note he received for radical patriots taking his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom's son joins the army to catch the bill, forcing Tom to join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later, the war is over and they can finally return the note for their boat. . The End. <br /> <br /> There were some battle scenes and they were mediocre at best. The transistions between the scenes were used "five months later" and magically trained the characters in a famous historical battle. The love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is hard to follow. So save your "Notes" and watch the Patriot instead.
