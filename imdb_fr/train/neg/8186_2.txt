Has anyone read the script? It must be one of the worst scripts and staging of the year. Three big players, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson failed to release this one. About two-thirds of the time, it seemed that Giamatti's eyes were saying: I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's really on the list of Christmas movies. Not enough lines, but what more? Okay, the movie does not move with Vaughn's dialogue, his character is just a scary guy that you can not pass. It was just a dull walk through which no one seemed to be able to enter.
