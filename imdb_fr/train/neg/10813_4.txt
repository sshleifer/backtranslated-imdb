The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I saw all versions of Jane Eyre ever created). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. Then, it was like someone saying, "Oh, oh, it's going on too long," and shredded the rest of the story. The main scenes, when included, are silenced, combined and put out of order so as to completely change the scenario. There was so little transition or even stage development that it would be difficult for anyone who was not even familiar with the story itself to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, then the end destroyed it.
