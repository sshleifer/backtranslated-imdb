I gave this film a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. It's little more than a black-and-white excuse to annoy the public even though the egotist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" with a ton of hams in his early days. A lot of adolescent sex shots come out of this movie, such as Making the Professor's wife, Helplessness, Making the naughty prostitute (which is very awkwardly turned and prevents things from stopping completely, not that things were really going 'anywhere' anyway. . <br /> <br /> I guess this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sexual nonsense, for me it was just annoying. I was much more concerned with cleaning my nails than looking at this mess.
