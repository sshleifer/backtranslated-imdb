If there was a strange festival at the Oscars reversed, this film would win everything. He possesses all the gods, an excellent plot, extreme special effects associated with very good acting skills and of course, there is a superstar of celebrities in all roles. Well, that could be the scenario if the world was reversed, but that's not the case. Instead, it's the worst horror film ever, not only the bad actors who seem to read the scripts of a teletypewriter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely weak in special effects. For example, the devil's costume (which is a must-see) is one of the most hilarious I have ever seen. Whenever I saw what was called a red-black monster on the screen, I could not hold back my laughter. And besides, it seems that the funny creature was transported by a treadmill. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. While watching IMDB, since the film was released in 2003, it had less than five voices and thought: - "It's worth it, it can not be so bad". <br /> <br /> Yes, it is possible. <BR /> <br /> I will not even lose more words on this movie.
