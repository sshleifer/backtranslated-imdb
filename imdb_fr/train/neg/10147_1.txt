In general, I do not comment anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one, I have to comment ... I was convinced to watch this movie by worlds like the action, the F-117 and other high-tech objects. , but it's only a few minutes and I changed my mind ... Nasty action game, deplorable scenario and great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not bother ... <br /> < br /> And one more thing, before any film, I usually check the comments of users and their ranking on this site ... 3.7 points and I give This film is an essay, now I wonder who evaluate this film in giving him more than 2 points ??????????
