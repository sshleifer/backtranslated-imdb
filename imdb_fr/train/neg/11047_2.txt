There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie. One reason is that some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) are working, who have tried to play at their usually good acting level. However, on many scenes, they were blocked by the wrong script. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the good idea of ​​the Cyborg, very different from most other roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as possible. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it seemed to be the first movie of all the actors. It could have been an interesting story, but they completely failed.
