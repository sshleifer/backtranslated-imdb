We have reached the threshold of improbability with this film. Basically, the dinosaurs board this ship piloted by a strange old pet named Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of the children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of the children that the dinosaurs are brought in modern times to be seen by all by an unscrupulous exploitation. Dinosaurs eat things that make them smarter (pity the writers do not have it). By the way, does it seem strange to you that, despite ALL the wishes of the children of the world, Neweyes fulfills the wish to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant the wishes of children to stop famine? Disease? War? I mean come! Neweyes has nothing better to do with all that power he has ??? Finally, when dinosaurs arrive in modern times, they begin to sing, dance, and wreak havoc (that kind of thing you might see on a bad trip with LSD, I mean, where would you go? do you see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a Spider-man balloon?). They find themselves in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) forces children who have made friends with dinosaurs to sign a blank contract. Why? Why would children sign a blank contract? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some ... "Brain-Drain" To let the kids go. The dinosaurs instead of tearing the evil member of Screweyes, give in and accept his conditions. What?! It's stupid! They could have just threatened him, made him cancel the contract, eat it and go away with the children. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that the violence was bad, which is a dubious point when the dinosaurs eventually escape and a bunch of crows surround Screweyes and eat it apparently completely. Oh yes, it's not violent at all! We're back makes no sense, it's not fun, it's awkward, it's silly, poorly written and contains some of the biggest holes in the plot ever engaged in the movie. Even for a children's movie ... it's bad.
