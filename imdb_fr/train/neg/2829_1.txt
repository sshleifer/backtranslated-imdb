The worst, and packed with people who really should know better (the actors have six Oscars between them). It takes place in a "contemporary" Africa (it was made in 1979) and concerns the slave trade. He is horribly scripted and acted (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden are at a low level in this career) and completely lacking in excitement, regardless of any moral concerns. It's also ridiculously drawn. You do not believe for a moment that none of the characters would behave as he does under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer runs but it seems like it was over the phone. It's as bad as possible.
