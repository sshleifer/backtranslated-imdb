At the end of "Dragon Heat", all I could think of was why I was bored during the whole session. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting, and that's what attracted me, as did Maggie Q. to the movie in the first place. But I was never disappointed. Screenwriter-director Daniel Lee can not hold the candle to John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This movie must be one of the most upset movies I have ever seen. Lee is so attached to his visual style - and I use this incredibly bad phrase - that he fills the film with totally useless still images in black and white, frozen images, slow motion, fast motion, and other visual nonsense. . I guess he did all of this to make up for the lack of a good story or a dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and unfold like a music video jumped up. There is little to worry about any of the characters - including two so-called professional snipers who could not hit the wide side of a barn from the inside! - who are then charged with the most cheesy dialogue I've seen in any of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of twists - since the initial editing, everything is in predictable - and Lee feels the need to constantly remind us of the stories of the characters in case we have not had it several times. It's a terribly amateurish writing and filmmaking that ruins the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although, to be honest, it's hard for me to remember that Biehn is in a good movie that was not made by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood to be a big actor in Hong Kong, you'd better stick to some of the basic stuff: "The Killer" by John Woo (1989) ) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992), "City on Fire" by Ringo Lam (1987) - that Quentin Tarantino flew for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his remake of "Point Blank" (1967), " Full Contact "(1992). Or check out Yuen's (2002) movie "So Close", an extremely entertaining yet absurd popcorn movie. And there is always the formidable actor of the French police, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> Of course, most, if not all, are a little exaggerated, but they were movies that remain exciting, exciting and even suspensful. They have characters we care about and amazing action sequences. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad action movie, he made a dull one.
