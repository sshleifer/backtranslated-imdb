** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) on the basis of the subsequent effort of the director Alejandro Amenabar "The Others". Based on what was this film that was brilliantly measured and horribly effective, I assumed that his first efforts would be of a similar quality and that I was in the mood to do a good horror. Instead, I ended up with the most tedious and absurd excuse of a lame-slasher movie I've seen since the German movie "Anatomy" (which reminded me a little). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential but it is thrown in the first 20 minutes. It revolves around the thesis of Angela (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer), psychology student, innocent and pretty on the theme of violence in films. In circumstances that are far too foolish to enter here, she finds herself in possession of a "snuff ribbon" on which two men torture, maim and kill a girl for the camera. Angela and her horrified friend, Chema (Fele Martinez) are shocked but intrigued by the video and decide to get to the bottom of things to determine who is responsible. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never really give the reason why they want to find the killers of the girl (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout the events that unfold, even when their life is in danger) and the mystery itself is as soft as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one "clue" (the type of camera used to discover killers) is a) very weak and b) released in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "denouement" occurs simply by chance, by more and more ridiculous twists and sadness of terrible red herrings, transparent and totally useless, that we throw simply to dismiss the race time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may be aware of his stories about ghosts, but it is clear that he has never read a detective book of his life. The key to a good thriller is to have a large group of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with intelligent deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving on to the last step. In "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD *, amateur detectives correctly assimilate the identity of the killer, then we get 100 minutes of the writer who tries faintly to reject the smell until he lacks ideas, throw his hands up and say "OK, you got me, it was after all"! As for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no luck. You watch the bad movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The only thing that hangs out "Tesis" far from being an idiotic and badly written thriller is the way it is actually trying to make a ridiculous and confusing "point" about violence in movies. I do not know at all which position he tries to adopt, but he seems determined to get into a ton of misguided and confused psychobabbles, between the rest of the gibberish and say "look at me! I am political!". The final scenes, in which the film's "point" is supposed to be home, are so absurd and puerile that one can not help wondering if Amenabar is feeling embarrassed now when he looks at this. If he does not, he should definitely. It's a total "amateur evening at the slasher house". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not believe I lost two full hours (at least six hours) about it, in the hope that something would happen. The urban legend of "snuff films" (and that's about all they are, despite the way this movie tries to suggest that they are some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) a domain that can be exploited so temptingly in good horrors movies ("Videodrome", you like?), but it is so easy to move on in childhood "it would not be cool if!" territory with it (ie "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" reaches a record level for the genre "snuff film". At all levels, it is better to leave this one dead and buried. I'll give it a 1 in 10, for good lighting, but that's all it takes.
