Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad acting, hard scripts, wooden lines, improbable situations, and so on. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work at so many levels. For all the reasons listed above and many others. This includes the absurd and blatant use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to the male genitals, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely due to ineptitude. As opposed to an attempt to do something really different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, just can not maintain the level of congruence and focus required by the modern audience. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. Unfortunately, it had to happen, as we saw on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can express is that the image at the end was beautiful. If it had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, the film could have taken off at the end of 2001 ... <br /> <br /> Too bad they did not try that instead. I just do not understand what was so important in this movie that it even had to be done. Was it the plot? This surely could not be. Was it the characters? I doubt; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was this the dialogue? Categorically no. The music? Perhaps, but more likely, the unglazed ego of the main ones to cuddle. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts have come to the level of the cutting room.
