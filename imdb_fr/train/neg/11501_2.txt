A romanticized and totally false "vision" of unemployment from a middle-class "artist" to a comfortable education ... It is clear that the author-director has never suffered directly from unemployment and has not certainly no personal experience. If you had to believe this story absolutely ridiculous, unemployed people of all ages behave like teenagers, feel no anger, no fear, no frustration, and so on. All the characters live day by day doing jokes, child jokes. They never seek work, almost never meet rejection, anxiety, etc. Living unemployed is almost like a summer vacation ... ridiculous. Especially if you compare it to contemporary masterpieces by Ken Loach, etc.
