This film reminds me of how university students were protesting the Vietnam War. As if, after hearing some kids do without cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the president would immediately change the entire foreign policy of the United States. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the concept of politics, although dangerous, on the basis if the USSR and the US went to war, it could mean the end of the world, worked . The United States and the USSR never went to war. <br /> <br /> If we had only had conventional weapons, the idea of ​​another war, a "winnable" war, in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. This should be seen by film students as a wonderful example of "How NOT to make a film." <br /> <br /> This should be 0 star or maybe black holes ...
