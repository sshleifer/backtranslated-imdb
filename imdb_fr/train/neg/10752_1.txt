This movie was so disappointing. According to the press release that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why do we call it that?), I was expecting something arty and thoughtful with beautiful pictures. There were interesting pictures, but these often seemed random and meaningless. In fact, they seemed to have been inserted to fill the time. In the end, the effect was apathetic. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was supposed to be atmospheric, but it just was not. The absence of a coherent plot did not help things. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent, without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot did not attract me enough to worry about her situation. Without looking at the list of actors, I would not have known that you saw the main character as a child. The film has very little context for the time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but the scenes of sex (there were several) seemed useless and confused me, I recognized Lulu but I did not know if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or if she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered that the hairy back was supposed to belong to her lover. This film managed to make what should have been shocking (dream sequences featuring Lulu's mother) a little boring. <br /> <br /> The nail ranking made more sense as it gave an indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors because they did not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was due to ineptitude or pretension. but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I do not bother to talk about it anymore.
