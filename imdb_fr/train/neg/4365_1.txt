Ariauna Albright is a very good actress, but the reason she participated in this bad parody is a mystery. What could have been fun ends up becoming a classic boredom. Ariauna's unique feature is that she can play as well as look sexy, unlike her partner Lilith Stabs who looks good, but it's obvious she spent the money for a theater school at the spa or a beautician. It's a production that calls for T & A and with an imaginative screenwriter who could have reached it by the thread of things. However, Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances and saves her reputation to a certain extent. The Tempe company must know that when you dress up two pretty women in skinny cop uniforms, viewers expect a fetish piece, said T & A. Nough.
