To make a good movie, you need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. We have none in this eye of the needle. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. He did not have to do much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he absolutely can not be the main actor of a film. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he does not appear more than 15 minutes. I would say for example that Sutherland was excellent in Oliver Stone's JFK when he spoke to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without stopping, not even catching his breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland is not good as a major actor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? It is probably good for television series. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I could not even appreciate the landscape of Storm Island because of the poor quality of the photography. <br /> <br /> Ken Follett's story was good, but it's a pity she made it an uninteresting movie.
