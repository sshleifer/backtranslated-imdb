I have seen a lot of stupid intrigues in my time, but this one is among the worst. After catching an illness in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. He then goes on a rampage and kills people (which is beyond me, I look at them, I can not explain them.) This is the kind of movie that should not have been done in the first place.
