The head of a New York family, Jane Gail (under the name of Mary Barton), works with her younger sister, Ethel Grandin (under the name of Loma Barton) at "Smyrner's Candy Store". After Ms. Grandin was abducted by traffickers who buy and sell women as prostituted slaves, Ms. Gail and her police boyfriend Matt Moore (under the name of Larry Burke) must help the young woman threatened with virtue . <br /> <br /> "Traffic in Souls" has a hard-to-defend reputation - it is not remarkably well done and shows nothing of the "virtue" of a young woman being threatened by sex traders . Perhaps it could be considered a film dealing with the subject with a length greater than usual (claimed to have ten reels originally). The scenes of New York City are the main attraction after all these years. The view of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, as nothing seems to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> **** Trafficking in Souls (24/11/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
