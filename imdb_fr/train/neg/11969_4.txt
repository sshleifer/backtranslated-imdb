If you like to entertain, do not go see this movie. If you like to see the heroes of the war, do not go see this movie. If you like to see good acting and an excellent storyline, do not go see this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war movies that end just in time to make a politically charged appeal to the public about the grandeur and glory of war, GO TO THIS FILM. Otherwise, do not waste your time. War films always interest me because I think that if they are well done, they can TEACH us about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of guys running through the countryside, saying great clich√© lines, doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same force and brutality as those given to the oppressed. This film is a shame for the cinema and the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe, Africa or any other country and looking at it, being told that this is the way Americans are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, do not waste your time on this piece of junk; if you must, wait and praise it. 4/10
