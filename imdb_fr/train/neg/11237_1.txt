I went to see this film with few expectations, but hoping to be charmed seeing my hometown film. Unfortunately, that's about all I have. The story covers a familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is complicated and a supernatural element does not add much to this well-used theme. Although the quality of the game is good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was flagrant - women are apparently not happy if they are not married, procreative or both (although this has been portrayed as a post-feminist choice). Worse still, racism - the sharp Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if we think that these characters represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo and that writers should be taken aback to have brought to the screen such wide and cruel stereotypes.
