This is the least scary movie I have ever seen. How the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film. The blob moves so slowly that an O.a.p in a zimmerframe might escape. The drop is very likely to fall on a typical woman of the horror film who, instead of running away, remains motionless for half an hour to be eaten. If you have not seen this movie that I recommend, it's way too funny to be taken seriously.
