With a cast of British characters and a nice photograph of 1950s Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck in the trap for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how horrible it was. I must have watched thousands of old movies and I'm always ready to make them products of their time, but it was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, a major problem is' seems not to know what he wants to be: a sweet romantic comedy, a burlesque comedy or a musical comedy. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly burst into the song about 15 minutes! It's not believable at any level, neither the story nor the fact that Daisy never seems to have an ounce of threat in her at any time. Among the other aspects that defy all credibility are the choice of Donald Sinden as songwriter (a songwriter for the love of God!), The fact that he has Diana Dors for fianc√©e and does not seem to have the least interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in the office of a song editor. The thing is ridiculous in the worst case. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the one from the beginning with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after which everything fell out of order way.
