It starts badly, with the three women acting like idiots of high school girls sitting around their gin, endless cigarettes and a feast of caramel chocolate for the one that tells the best man story, then it gets worse - = - spoiler alert = - = with Andie's character who falls for the young organ player who was his pupil at the age of 14 (she is the director of an English school, believe it or not ), only to destroy it thanks to his bitch-in-hell 'girlfriend'. And then from there, it is a trap at once unassailable: she forgives her "friend" and makes love the child of the organ player and the 3 women find themselves as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws caramel chocolates into the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have pity.
