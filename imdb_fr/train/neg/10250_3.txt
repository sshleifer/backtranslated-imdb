Dirty and cheap science-fiction thriller made with almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from space is handled by one man and is VERY poorly guarded at night), and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his performances "I am here only for the money". (* 1/2)
