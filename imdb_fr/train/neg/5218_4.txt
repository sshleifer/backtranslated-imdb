All the elements for a bad night at the cinema are in place: a jostling dialogue of techno-babbling biological, chintzy decorations, balsa-wood playing, horrible Casio score of the late 80s, and overall appearance that foreshadows anything either of the scenario. Programming of Fi Channel, circa 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with many promises, the film reveals a bland idiocy and a cheese at the MST3K in the role of Clark Kent, the "Doctor" Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) who makes pressure him to spread information about his secret projects. But when he tests his vague experience with himself, he becomes a vaguely defined creature (more like a "Dr. Freudstein" of "House by the Cemetery"). The work on currency effects is good enough for so obviously low-budget production (although I suppose most is left in the shadows for a reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad Retro aftertaste in your guts, despite his hopes to influence us otherwise. I can not help but agree with the final remark of a character: "(It was) a nightmare ... of the past!"
