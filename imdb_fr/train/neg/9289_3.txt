for those of you who were desperate to know what happened to Twitch in the original movie, here's your chance, then come back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hid the gold in the first film told Twitch, so he's transferred to another prison, where the wrestling champions hang around looking at the convent. Twitch plans to get out of prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot. The film turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is in the thick of things, so he's going to meet her with Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the acting is below normal, it has a lot of rap music and badly edited fight scenes. On the positive side, there is this Hispanic guy, who plays in all the prisons / actions / thrillers ever made, and he closes the door there. <br /> <br /> It's not very hectic, but at least it's harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were an unconditional fan of the original, that's fine, good stuff. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you have been warned.
