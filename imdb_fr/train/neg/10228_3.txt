To be honest, I had heard that it was rather serious before deciding to watch it, but I never let others influence my views. In fact, I'm more likely to look at something by challenge! Bullwhip still had something for me before the show, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were inside me immediately interested. The photo is not very good, and is actually very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shaky in one form or another, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, it's fine if the surrounding movie can do it justice to a group of despicable people and create a chilly climax tense chart. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and as the final fills you with sugar, you can not help but shout that you've been cheated to watch a very bad movie. No one in the cast comes out with any credit, with the lead role Guy Madison. The wood to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Even the lovely Rhonda can not recommend me to anyone, 3/10
