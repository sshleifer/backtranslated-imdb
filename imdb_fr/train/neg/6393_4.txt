I will admit that I did not give much luck to this film. I decided early on that it was not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it has an excellent appearance in terms of cinematography. The scenes of the early 70s in Manhattan are very beautiful, just like the main actress. This is a very sharp black and white, which could almost give the impression that the film is undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques employed by filmmakers draw this perspective to the bottom. The disjointed montage is very late sixties, between surrealism and the new wave. The story also gives the impression that it comes from a very special moment, between idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film follows a girl from the city looking for a man with whom she had an anonymous phone. sex with. When she meets other strange characters, she reveals her quirks and theirs. The film seems to be conceived as an unthinking comedy and offbeat, but adds an avant-garde atmosphere. I would expect if you like Andy Warhol's movies, you're very happy to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: Near the end of the film, a character tells a ragged anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes ?? - brutal to sit down. In addition, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found rude and juvenile that serves as a climax to the film. I burst out laughing four or five times and I liked the end (minus the disgusting animation). And when the film went to color for the final sequence "phone booth at night", I actually enjoyed the rendering even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt that I would have really liked it if it was a little different. But that's what the filmmakers gave us. It's dark, artistic, and very much to the left of the dial, but it's not a reason to recommend it alone. I did not find him unique or creative, but forced and pretentious.
