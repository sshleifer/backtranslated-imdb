Absolutely ridiculous film. I live in London and the plot is so poorly documented that it's ridiculous. Nobody could be terrorized on the London Underground. Shortly after each night, maintenance crews check the tracks, do the repairs, and so on. It is equally unlikely that homeless people will live there. Or that it is even possible to get stuck and not have access to a mobile phone at this time ... <br /> <br /> The worst that could happen if someone was there after the last train is that they could receive graffiti on them. Although this has been mastered because of the large number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the back of the story. (Remember that throughout London, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it had been installed in a city I do not know not good, I might have been able to enjoy it out of ignorance, but it's not a high-quality movie, I simply could not bring myself to suspend my disbelief and take advantage of it for the banal story he is. <br /> <br /> I would have given 0/10 if such a rating existed! Perhaps the most disappointing movie I thought I would like.
