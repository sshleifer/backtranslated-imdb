Let Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven offer an unnecessarily shabby and juvenile version of the story of INVISIBLE MAN. If he made a film about Pokemon, I'm sure he would make a huge orgy. I do not pay attention to the sex or even the film (see my other reviews) on the film, but frankly, it is obvious that the director has only one spirit on a track and that he does not see the interesting aspects of an invisible man scenario that its perverse implications. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film had not spent so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon groping women. <br /> <br /> Actors of the game do what he can with the monochrome cheese scenario, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally ruined here. <br /> <br /> But then what could I expect from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, in fact, is much more entertaining than this raised and bad movie.
