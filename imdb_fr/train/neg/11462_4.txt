I like monster movies, in general. Even if they are implausible and stupid. But it's hard to love this movie when it's so improbable and ridiculous AND tries to take it seriously all at once. As if the idea was factual, as orcas are known to kill great white sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can not help but see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff. Especially this scene where a building exploded because of the Orca ... and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and I had the impression to watch a show at Sea World with a fire of artifice. Plus, they kill a lot of scary moments before they even say they're going to happen. In addition to that, it takes some jabs to JAWS. It's like "hey, look, we're factual and we can find BETTER reasons why the Orca attacks." . But JAWS had one thing that your movie does not do. It's scary. Yes, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's a bit outrageous. But frankly, whether factual or not, a Killer Shark is not as scary as the Great White. And the poor attempt to develop character and writing hurts him more. Even JAWS the Revenge is more scary than that.
