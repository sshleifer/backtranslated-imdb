I had the opportunity to see a preview of this film and I hope they will have time to modify it in any way possible to improve it before its release on August 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live as "Hot" Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his dead father. When we meet him, he jumps on a van on his truck, yes, a truck, and almost succeeds. It would be worthy of a Jackass movie if he did not honestly try to do that. Isla Fisher plays the girl next door slightly older and much more mature, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his "crew". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays her half-brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. She remarried with Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real tough guy who likes to beat Rod in real fights. It is clear that Rod will not deserve Frank's respect before he can beat him. We discover that Frank needs $ 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise funds to "fight the ass" once cured and proven. A long fall in a mountain convinced Rod to "do the big thing" during a waterfall. Rod is looking for seed money by charging stunts that would make you cringe if you see them in real life. Like the human torch - at a child's birthday party. There were those in the show who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. At the moment when all hope and money are lost, a sponsor comes to save the situation by buying the 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. He earns exclusive broadcast rights and establishes phone lines to collect donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real bike. The whole city ends and the world listens. Does it make the jump? Does he have the girl? Do they collect the $ 50,000? Is Frank being beaten by Rod? Wait for this 90-minute film to appear on video to find out.
