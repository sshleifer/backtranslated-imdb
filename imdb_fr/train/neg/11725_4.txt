STAR: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) hides on his ranch in Montana after failed to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he is approached again by the agency to go to London and try his luck. His target was apprehended there and is under heavy police protection - but they do not want him to simply capture their man - they want him taken away. All goes well, but then the mission is sloppy and when a senior police officer, Windsor (Charles Dance), is killed, the blame falls at the feet of Dial. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a neighboring house and befriends a girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett), who is struggling with his own problem and becomes his unintentional companion at the time of making himself understood and to find out who betrayed him. This last DVD Snipes getaway came out of nowhere, with minimal advertising, even for something as short a time (I do not remember seeing any commercials or for that nowhere.) With that in mind and after the Snipes DVD story, it might have seemed like something Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop as it's hot. But I felt compelled to try anyway. It is not one of the worst, but does not meet the standards of some of its best (The Detonator, 7 seconds, says it all, really), either. <br /> <br /> At best, it's a little suspenseful, with a minimum of action, a kind of cool dialogue and Snipes not really at its best in the lead role. Similarly, in a main role, it is clear that Dance was only presented for the paycheck, and this is usually an event that no cast member will scream for the hill about his CV. <br /> <br /> That says a lot about the fact that, in the end, the only "deal" that might interest you is where Snipes will end Sony and end all action movies under-DVD. **
