I went to see this a few days ago and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a laugh at the theater (maybe for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was sometimes difficult to understand what they were saying. They just talk fast and do not open enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I found myself saying that after a supposedly funny phrase "what, what did he say", and I'm French. I do not like to say that, considering that I think good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who will see the film (if ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are deeply sorry for this cr @ p. 2/10
