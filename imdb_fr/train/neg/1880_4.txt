Even though I'm a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it was only about 6 years ago that I saw "Follow the Fleet" for the first time. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but I did not know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as long as the songs are catchy and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny I just can not like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to catch up with his longtime partner, he is continually sabotaging his career. His character does not have the usual humor and enthusiasm of Astaire's characters from other films. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching for Ginger Rogers' songs and great taping routine.
