This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it is an intriguing and compelling argument that the story of Jesus, as is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after having prepared for it, the film changes completely and becomes little more than an incessant attack on Christianity, and focuses primarily on easy targets. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter / director clearly has some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his form of liberation. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes longer, but overall, the film is disappointing.
