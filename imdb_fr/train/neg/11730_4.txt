Investigative journalist Darren McGavin (Carl Kolchak) is back; this time he is after "The Night Strangler". Once again, the police and other journalists do not believe or want to hide the supernatural angle. Producer and director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", with naturally less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis assembles a fun cast and includes the alumni of "Dark Shadows", George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (under the name of Louise Harper) runs a sexy collection of belly dancers. And, although I've never seen it mentioned anywhere else, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's meal companion in an early scene, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Strangler of the Night (16/01/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
