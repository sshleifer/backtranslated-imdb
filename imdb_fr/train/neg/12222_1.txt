(Honestly, Barbra, I know you're the one who slams all the "NO" of my exam 22 times ?? How many people did you have to teach to help you here? You have nothing better to do, How do you look in the mirror all day? <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra it was "the best movie I've seen since" Citizen Kane "". It says a lot about everything and serves as a terrible warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients of a sure film disaster that will haunt you without letting you forget tears of laughter? and the pain? The ingredients: the face of Barbra Streisand, a musical, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, the direction of Barbra Streisand and an ultra-corny / idiot principle. In fact, almost everyone ?? by definition ?? must be an Egyptian in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For the "art"?!? Well, how stupid are you to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews ?? And Streisand has the biggest ego of all! It's a success. To be surrounded by narcissistic idiots and succeed in surpassing them all? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film, like all his projects "solo", is a journey in the ego, straight out of hell. Each Streisand scene is automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But as that was not enough, she sings a lot of Streisandy songs ?? you know, the kind that has helped the Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious waves for decades. Just for that, she deserves not one, but 100 episodes of South Park that make fun of her. <br /> <br /> The principle, Streisand disguised as a man to study to become a rabbi, looks like a ZAZ crazy comedy. Outside the clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman or a man. In fact, I'm not even sure she's human. The way she looks in this movie, well? it can not be described in words. E.T. looks like a high school jock in comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015. She looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shudder. Especially "Daddy can you hear me Squeel like a mad walrus in heat?" and "Tomorrow evening, I will prepare the continuation, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand was planning to make a nose early in her career, but changed her mind when they told her that her voice might change? Can you believe that? She should have done it! To kill two flies at once, that's what it would have been. <br /> <br /> If you want to read my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email. <br /> <br /> Should BARBRA STREISAND COME IN RETIREMENT? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
