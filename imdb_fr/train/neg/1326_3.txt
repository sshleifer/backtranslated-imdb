Dribble stupid on the second coming of Christ in the form of a Sandra Locke in search of a hippie and an albino. You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song "Suzanne" which is played throughout the movie until "The Second Coming of Suzanne" is over, you already know it very loud, no matter how difficult to forget. all. <br /> <br /> Jared Martin, director of the movie filmmaker Logan, is ready to make the film of the century, but is so rude and hateful that no one in the banking world wants to finance his project. He plans to leave on his side and then spots the couple in a caf√© by the sea. He is fascinated by the young woman Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ . <br /> <br /> With Richard Dreyfuss, Logan's assistant and musician Clavius, getting some sort of $ 740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece. He begins to work on Suzanne by flattering her with her talent as an actress in order to interest her more in her film. This leads Suzanne to leave not only her boyfriend Simon, Paul Sand, but later, Simon being so depressed and feeling lonely, takes a gun in his mouth and wounds his brain. <br /> <br /> The film also has two somewhat independent subplots that concern a Dorothy autistic girl, Kari Avalos, who cured her autism by Suzanne after everyone, at the psychiatric hospital in which she had engaged, failed. Suzanne did not really know what she was doing at the hospital, but she appeared to be some sort of prescription or volunteer there; Was it supposed to show us in the audience that she could, like Jesus, heal the sick miraculously? <br /> <br /> There is also this press columnist and great businessman, Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical vision that has changed his life forever. Sinclair sought to understand the meaning of life and all that was in the film and wanted to know why there was all this suffering in the world, like this movie in which he is, and seemed to have found the answer when he had made her look at Suzanne. Sinclair was also dizzy when his private driver David, Mark Rasmusser, who got tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, almost ran him down a cliff into a kamikaze, as well as down the coast. Peaceful. <br /> The film "Suzanne's Second Coming" continues with a number of unrelated sequences, probably to be completed or completed sometime by her director and film editor, and then moves on to her final scene in a crucifixion worthy of Christ a hill like Logan has all the cameras that roll. It turns out that the mad Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to reproduce, on the impotent and tied up Suzanne, the true crucifixion of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago . <br /> <br /> It's hard to sit down "It's almost impossible to follow" "Suzanne's second coming" exposes you to the same torture as that inflicted on Suzanne by Logan and the directors of the film. The film tries to be a little arty, but it's just an excuse to hide its brainless and non-existent scenario and, worse, for the terrible and amateur actor of everyone.
