There were difficult times in my life when I was stunned and depressed. This is one of them who sits through Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were present. No first (even the stars did not want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat during the movie was hoping to make up for my sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film has been explained. The narration was silly. I applauded at one point when the film seemed to have been shot, and then, in the face of growing desperation, it was revealed that it had not really been shot, which lessened my joy. I sincerely hope that all the actors of the film are hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mostly unintentional moments of humor. For example, the scene in which the main character feels, for some unknown reason, the need to relieve themselves manually in a washroom, while asking the person in the next room to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel and I will conclude this way. <br /> <br /> Rancid aluminum: for sadists, lunatics and regressives only those who want to torture themselves.
