The opening scenes move as easily as frozen Velveeta. The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me want to better control the rapid control. Vampires are usually described as disgusting, sexy and intelligent creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. I usually count a count, so there was a cat (who does not count), a girl who falls from the sky with a sword (anything else), and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting the apple for a vampire biting a victim is simply ridiculous. I loved Warlock, but this movie smelled so bad that we turned it off and it was so forgettable that we rented it a year later to turn it off again.
