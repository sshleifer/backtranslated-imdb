A pile of cow manure steaming. It's amazing to me that this film was even shot. Hip-hop and old westerns do not seem to mix. What target audience did these people think of when planning this sinking? <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and the plot a joke, but the acting game is excruciating the film makes their career a laughing stock. Clueless's daughter should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any dignity left to her. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she should have asked one of her friends to play this sick joke. After some research, I actually found a list of actors who transmitted this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, I'd rather stare at a blank television than watch this movie again.
