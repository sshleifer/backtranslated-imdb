The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars has not been touched on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is rather the mystery that explains the persistence of this persistent disappointment in terms of ranking. This week marked the beginning of a week for Veronica Mars: she ranked 146th on 146 shows in the big 6 (soon the Big 5). Yes, you read correctly. Veronica Mars has been beaten at every show of the late WB and every show on UPN. He was beaten by all Fox shows and, of course, by all ABC, CBS and NBC broadcasts. <br /> <br /> Now the hypophytes of the hip will say: but it was a recovery. But everything that was broadcast on television that week was rather reviewed! Why did CW choose this disappointment of proven odds is one of the few shows she saved from the UPN? <br /> <br /> It is clear that something is going on behind the scenes. Favors are exchanged and an influence peddled. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead now that she had two years to settle and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's the influence and weight of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm lost why would anyone choose to spend his influence on a bad show that none audience does not look. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a very unfavorable beginning for CW.
