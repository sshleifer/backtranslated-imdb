It is difficult to rent this movie a lot. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but it lacked a suitable model for light and shadows. In addition, the same images are used to infinity, showing the dragon stomping in the hallways, which becomes a little tedious. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the credits, wondering what ex-Roman emperor Empire was playing in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg", it must be a pseudonym, and can we blame him for using one if he appears in this sniffer. <br /> <br /> The story might be interesting, but the acting is flat and the direction tedious. If you MUST watch this movie, go to your friend's house and drink while doing it, so it will be nice.
