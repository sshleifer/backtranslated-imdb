David Lynch's movie about South Park presents a nightmare of troubling clich√©s about suburban middle-class families. The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a huge, circular mouth where the most horrible guttural noises are uttered; the son and mother are constantly horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are featured throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for her comedies (ie On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I do not particularly like comedies in general. . However, there were some scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some intelligent elements of animated cinematography - where Lynch conveys a wide range of reactions in his characters via a syntactic arrangement of shots rather than facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch was really trying to give his audience a simple, but disturbing, animated comedy here. It is interesting to note that he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low humor (that is, most of Will Farrell's films) while adding elements of perverse social criticism, of classic comic book violence and rude humor. Although the mix does not really work well here, it's nothing but the lynchian. <br /> <br /> Must see by Lynch fans.
