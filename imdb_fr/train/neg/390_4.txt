I liked the apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now, with season 5? (or is it 6?) things just get too tired. <br /> <br /> I loved the show, but it became Donald Trumps ego party. Granted his sound that you will work for, but go! some things say "you're FIRED" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or otherwise. It's just that the show is unrealistic and the way it handles things makes me uncomfortable. Good entertainment? YES, but tiring as stabbed in the back gets so tiring .. it's not a team job, it's not personal, it's just a bargain. watch your catch.
