This is perhaps the worst attempt of a zombie movie that I have ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any criticism found on this site is obviously the work of the filmmaker, the family of filmmakers or a friend of the filmmaker. How is this film nil? Let us count the means ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam the effects / gore because I understand it's a small budget. But was there even a zombie who was not obese? Let's go there! And for a film taking place in Rhode Island, why did this truck carry a Massachusetts plaque? Continuity, find it. <br /> <br /> The girl dances while the soldier is "listening". Please, do not put your old girlfriend or your boyfriend's sister in your nude movie. It was an ugly film full of ugly people, and nothing says that Romero is covering. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not do it.
