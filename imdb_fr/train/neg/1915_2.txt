This is a very good cast, but the film has no resemblance to the grace of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street" Anyone looking for an entertaining caper movie should visit the original. William Macy is perhaps one of our greatest living actors, but here he is little used. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel a little sorry for him to try to fill these shoes. As much to try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured but adds nothing to the story, the extra elements added to the story feel totally useless and the things they carry are missing. Even starting this way seems oddly free and takes the surprise off the original. Sam Rockwell has its strange and awesome charm and Luis Guzman has his strange charisma, but the love story part of the movie just looks awkward and flat. It's unfortunate that no one understood how to make this film as well as it was shot, but it's still a pity that we live in a culture where we feel we have to do some amazing things instead of learn to savor the originals.
