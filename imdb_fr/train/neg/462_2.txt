This must be considered one of the worst movies of all time. Bad acting, terrible scenario ... and these were the good points One to miss absolutely! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to minimize the fact that her acting is as plastic! I sat ready to give it a chance, hoping that it would improve, which was not the case, alas! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle for a good read! I love Denise Richards, that's why I tried this film, but why she let herself sink in this film exceeds me!
