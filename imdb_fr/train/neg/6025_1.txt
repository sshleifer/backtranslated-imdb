Left Behind is the kind of movie "we know what we know because we know it" which Christians (and most naive ones) need to help them feel like what they "think" and "believe" (and not right) But at the same time, I feel bad for the little guys, because it's not a well-made movie, it does not help in ANY message, I work in a video store and I KNOW THAT THE ONLY reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was. EVERYONE on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, to unless they think they know they do not know, I've had enough (but only after having too many) of those people who are wandering their noses thinking that a film starring a half-talented TV actor means more than me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you'll stay away. I refuse to go into the details of this movie (not because I did not see it (because I saw it), B-it was too shocking for my self-atheist to handle (because this was not the case), or really donate I have nothing to reproach about it (because I do). The reason (which is a word that nobody helped to make this film understand) is that I want this film to come out of my head, I want it to be made of my head, I want to see everything with open mind, I want the message that Kirk gives so proudly and if coach at the end of the film, I only want everything that was in my head BEFORE watching this movie there, all that is directly related to this movie floating in my head GET OUT! I'm sorry someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie that could happen in the future (but will not do it) when they could have donated only Seven Dollars Plus to any number of Human charities , Animal or Rainforest. that then they could not "believe" in the fact that it is real, they might have to do what is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (on ****)
