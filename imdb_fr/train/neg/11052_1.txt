The Deadly Wake is THE IDEAL MOVIE for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the team ruin in this movie? The worst mix of music The worst editing The worst scenario THE REALITY OF THE REALIZATION The worst choreography The worst choreography The worst cinematography The worst of accessories The worst scenery The worst lighting etc. ... it would still be awful. All the scenes are dark (people call it "black"), often the score choked the winding dialogues, which was OK because no one ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses. The "evil" robot was hilarious ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I guess it was supposed to work tactically or something. I'm sure it scared the hearts ... poor publishers. And how do you edit so much waste footage? Not possible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you splice it. How was anyone able to do this through the daily newspapers? <br /> <br /> In summary, I could not stand watching more than 15 minutes of footage, it was so bad ... but I saw it all (with lots of breaks) just to see if there were good parties in all. NOPE! NO! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a film ... to see absolutely for all students in serious cinema !!!
