Well, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about flies swimming aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did it. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give the artists accessories to do their homework on the material. As far as I know, the rockets and launching material exploded. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me shivers, as always does a good rocket launcher (the blood from the gearhead of my Popular Mechanics aircraft is still so powerful) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG was not Pixar quality, but it was generally good. The flies were a bit anthropomorphic mediocre, with some half-lost characters from the late 60's inserted for color (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the worms looked more like baby worms (<br /> <br /> The writers have certainly not done their job by relying on offensive and outdated clich√©s (gender policy of the 60s including female characters mostly useless , racial stereotypes, bad Russians, big fly that just wants to eat, rude second-grade humor.) In a film for IMAX, they left a great opportunity to slip into educational content about physics and travel in space - they did not get the desired results (zero-g in the lunar module when landed burnt? PLEASE.) t even not worth reading the tra original radio announcements between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which looks like shit. <br /> <br /> But we liked maggots. <br /> <br /> They have a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Um yes. 1.5 / 5.
