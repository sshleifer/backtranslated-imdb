Wow, this movie was just horrible. SO, in fact, that even though I did not pay to see it, I still wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> The film does not speak of anything intelligible. It's a mix of sci-fi clich√©s that have been better done by much more skilled filmmakers. Performance, particularly from the leaders, was exacerbated in a less attractive way by Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too taciturn, with no hint of irony or humor. In addition, it makes no sense, any more than the plot or the plot. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are correct, but not enough to say "oh wow, that's cool" and they just seem to be cast for "being cool" rather than being a good plot device . <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another hodgepodge of things that never really created a mood. Again, it seemed that the director was introducing songs into the film in an effort to "be cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my last point. Maybe if the director was more concerned with plot, story and dialogue than trying to be cool, he would not have done a dorky snapshot of a short film . <br /> <br />
