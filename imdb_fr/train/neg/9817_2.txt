Wow ... just brilliant. <br /> <br /> Transform a thriller / suspense / horror into comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I have never laughed so much about a horror movie before ... A ridiculous plot with 3 characters that have been incredibly developed - either not written in depth or too deep. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie absolutely written with a stupid dialogue, a damn plot, unnecessary scenes, lost characters, bad sound and ugly development overall, it's the choice to watch <br /> <br /> Make sure to stay focused on the classic scene of the "food processor" and the totally incompetent police investigation scenes. /> <br /> This is a new record for screen and writing performance. Staying on it for the duration of your life makes you stupid, daring or brave.
