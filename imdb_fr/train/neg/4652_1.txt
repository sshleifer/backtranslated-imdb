It was a painful example of an inexpensive, boring, non-original program produced by Australian television stations to meet local content quotas. The writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are the ones responsible for Australia's worst recent memory film, the Honorable Senator Wally Norman. slightly amusing. It was just tired and BAD and, worse, I thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very worrying about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there was not much) and it's impossible. Or crazy. There are loaves of bread more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and, if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laughs that deserved were unintentional.
