The box for "To Die For" sucked me in - a hunky shirtless guy and the promise of some laughs and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is sweet to the eyes, but who does not laugh and does not show much evil. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, would have been together for several years, but none of the characters are interesting. enough to care, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The fault seems to be in the script, not in the performances; both actors do their best with what they receive. <br /> <br /> The end is sullen and ineffective (well, not totally without effect, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun movie about homosexual relationships and AIDS, "Look" is much better.
