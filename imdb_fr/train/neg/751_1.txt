Honestly, I believe that anyone planning to shoot a movie will fall victim to this bewildering failure. Like the "movies" of Edward Wood, Jr. in the '60s and' 70s, this film is a shining example of why filmmakers spend so much energy rewriting scripts, reissuing their films and reworking their effects special look right. This film is also a decent argument for the pre-selection process of studios. If Mr. Hines were forced to undergo the honest reactions of an impartial audience, he might have cut 75% of the walking / running / walking scenes and edited this film for a more bearable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should see this film as an example of the real danger of thinking that their work is "good enough". Every performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, and even every image of the video expresses the danger of seeking mediocrity. A beginner filmmaker may be tempted from time to time to think "At least I accomplished something" or "I just finished, it will be an achievement in itself". This film will help them understand how badly a movie can go. <br /> <br /> It would also be beneficial for critics to see this film before qualifying the latest summer entertainment as "the worst movie of all time". <br /> <br /> Beginning authors can learn from this film the importance of rewriting and perhaps understand the need to rewrite it. In addition, beginning filmmakers can learn the importance of a good script and a certain respect for the difficulty of writing a screenplay that forces the audience to feel emotionally constrained during the course of the story. Authors and directors who watch bad movies of the week and think "I can do better than CE" can see how this film makes it difficult to produce poor results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as a teaching tool for beginner filmmakers. Especially those who enter the craft industry in the current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environments. There is a reason why filmmakers like these are praised for their ability with special effects. The war of the worlds clearly shows that not everyone can do it. Some can not even come close.
