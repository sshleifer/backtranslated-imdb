Knowing how old a movie is is to prepare the viewer for a few things and, with these ideas in mind, maybe the movie will be more tolerable. So that was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies. It is to be expected that much reliance will be placed on tedious dialogue and vague movements, as well as the primitiveness (or absence) of special effects at that time. The viewer's imagination demands a lot - maybe too much, in this case. And the plot is not easy to follow: some Southeast Asian soldiers who lost their zombie during the First World War had very admirable performances. Although skeptical as to why, if true, the explanation should remain in the wrong hands, then, a group embarks on an archaeological investigation. A member of the expedition learns the key to long-distance hypnosis, which uses it to temporarily do without the son-in-law of the girl he loves. To prove her love for her, he gives up on everyone, which he should not have done because, once they are all dead, many want to kill him so he does not control them anymore. never. Below average, even with a little caution. Recommended for very patients.
