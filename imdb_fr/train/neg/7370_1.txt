I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most are not great or good, this flaming stack has lowered the bar for bad movies. <br /> <br /> The plot: not really sure. Something about a medicine that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good and the bad? Hard to say. Most of the film is composed of scenes cut between people in dark rooms to complain about the quality of Mashall's character ",,,,,,, What was with the horrible voice that overlapped ?! Could they find someone who looks less like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong would have made the voice, which could have been at least entertaining at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid, avoid it at all costs !!!!
