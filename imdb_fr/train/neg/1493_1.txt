I really do not understand how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more disconcerting are those who watched this film without feeling stolen after 88 minutes of valuable activity, such as cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, they would surely have been able to find real Irish and some pretty women able to deliver their replicas better than porn stars haggard and washed throughout the film. Certainly, the gore works - but strangely enough, it's not as disturbing as you might think to see organs being pulled out of tense (formerly) tight bodies of pornstars left and right. This is probably because after their horrible inhuman game, you just want them to die in pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not care at all about the following: <br /> - play (seriously, everyone is afraid.I have never witnessed this before, everyone fears). <br /> <br /> the film only makes sense if you are as badly treated as the writers were obviously). <br /> <br /> - theme (Nothing to learn from this film, nothing to fear in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or to grasp, nor to explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (shit, shit, shit, music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /> <br /> - scenery (It could have been the grace of this film, but nothing ... nothing nice here ... Even the rocks are fake). <br /> <br /> So, yes. If you do not care about this, and you're just an excited teenager with a bad taste for music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography sometimes, wasted on the other elements. Gore very realistic; again, wasted. But the scene of the intestines is classic. I agree with mutilation - de-stamping solves the problem of false accent.
