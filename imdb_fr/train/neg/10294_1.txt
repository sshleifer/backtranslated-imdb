Nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> Then the characters without personality do not develop. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning or middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not made beautiful because they are not even allowed, because this film is not even there. There is no "is" in this film because there is no plot, characters, themes, ideas, symbolism, discussion, dialogue or subject. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: he has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the film itself is such that the viewing is not even worth your time. If you are really interested, I would advise you to buy the soundtrack or something. This film will give you all you can without fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
