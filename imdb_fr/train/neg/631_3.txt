Unbelievable. That's what you would say if you were sitting through this movie. Incredibly, just amazing. In fact, it is so amazing that anyone who was stupid enough to invest money in making this monstrosity simply can not believe what you see. Here, my friends, is what is really scary about this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazingly original story: a high school student (who at times looked like a college student) has a prostitute for a mom, lives in a trailer park and is an "artist" "ridiculed for his" being all different. " Well, of course, this poor boy ridiculed is finally killed and here is the original part, his soul lives a scarecrow (below which he is killed by the last client of his slutty mom). Then he goes around with the standard slaughter of all the people who made him hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - An incredibly funny movie - even if it's not what the filmmakers clearly wanted drunk. <br /> <br /> --This is the result of a $ 5.00 Wal-Mart record - so it's a little too expensive. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt him, I did not do it Help: <br /> <br /> --Violence and violence are somehow inferior to the norm A person is stabbed with an ear of corn. <br /> <br /> - It looks like they put a little effort in the music - but it does not really fit the film "and it's not so good. <BR /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - A terrific and terrifying acting game. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher dropped with sexy women ?? none of them undressing. When did this stop being a staple of low-eyebrow slashers? <br /> <br /> --Laughing history. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow vomits trollers who would make freddy kruger and Arnold Swartzenegger blushes. <br /> <br /> - A standard underlying love story is not going anywhere, and is poorly done. <br /> <br /> - Some people killed seem to have been chosen at random ?? we never really know who someone is and then they are killed. And you just suppose they must have seen it happen. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - An extremely average slasher price, just with a deadly scarecrow instead of ?? Well, all this other shit. <br /> <br /> - Now as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, who are all better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> - The worst dialogue I have ever heard in my life. The scenario is laden with a delay that I would have never imagined possible. I am serious here ?? it is a step forward terrible. Do not get me wrong, it's funny, but I've never heard more silly jokes, even in "Slumber Party Massacre III". This film makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes the scarecrow: the worst wig of all time. Dial to match. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> --The place where young people from the elementary school vomit their own spiritual dialogue: "Hey, let's find little animals to torture." Huh huh . "<br /> <br /> Actor: 3/10 History: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1 / 10 (No nudity, a mom is a whore, girls do not wear bra) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Poor quality, mediocre) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, flagrant, excessive and painfully This is my first note for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Playfulness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> < Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another for people like me who like to look at pure shit. Or slasher film finishers. It's not a good movie at all. Dialogues and ludicrous characters keep him from being really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
