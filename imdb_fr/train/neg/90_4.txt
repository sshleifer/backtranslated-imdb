: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the joy that reigns in love. It was a long time since I waited and I finally had the opportunity to repeat it Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three movies "Love", but this one did not look like what I thought. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were a lot of blunders and the editing was very mediocre - many scenes out of context. I also think that little Kathy's death came very soon and that the appearance of Clarks in the movie did not seem to correspond to reality. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there - they all lacked emotion. There did not seem to be any interaction between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the writers should have gone further in the book. It seems that all the films made so far are moving away more and more from the writings of Janette Oke. I mean in the movie, they never talked about the mine and both boys or Clark were injured because of that. And I think that Missie and Willies' reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than simply being heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I must say that love is a lasting joy is my least favorite. I hope that with the next four films, more book is tracked and if the Clarks character is in these, I hope he has a bigger role and I hope his role is not so bland. I also hope there's more Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the writers will have in reserve.
