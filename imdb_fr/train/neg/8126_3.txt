I did not think it was as horrible as some people apparently. This is one of those nerdy horror movies with which you could waste time in the middle of the night when you can not sleep, although it is true that it is not of better quality than that . It's true that the acting is not great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, seemed completely without passion - but the main problem is that many aspects of the plot did not really meaningful. The Becks make a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part of the work and part of the honeymoon they never had (now it's romantic!). The work part has something to do with the caves on tour, which in itself seems strange is a group of visitors in a cave related to anyone's work?) But it gets more and more weird when we learn that he is a doctor who is doing research in the field of preventive medicine (eh? This link has completely lost me.) In the cave, it starts to turn into what I assumed was supposed to be a hybrid human-bat (although when we finally see it made up, it looks much more like a monkey-man) and a killing begins. Here is another problem. The first murder is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks that his death is an accident. The second murder is that of a girl who cut her throat. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) tells us that his death was similar to that of the nurse (which means that his throat was torn off?) - How could anyone think it was an accident? what about the sheriff? It seems like a nonsense up to the stage in Cathy's hotel room where he takes a sip of alcohol and almost rapes her, after which everything seems to return to normal. It comes up against an end that has left almost everything unresolved, as well as one of the most irritating theme songs I've ever heard in a movie. Still, there was something here that made me look. Sometimes pure cheesiness can make you spend an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as bad as some people say.
