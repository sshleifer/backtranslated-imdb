This is one of the most insipid films, without brilliance, without originality and without goal never realized! It almost seems like everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an attractive movie. This is nothing more than the continuation of a series of tedious films that attempt to capitalize on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which, in my opinion, is the best of all. When it comes to the waste of dandruff, Burt Reynolds is wandering through the movie, Jim Nabors is lost, the other actors do not have much to do, the car races are obviously archival footage, Humor does not lack inspiration, and many scenes are duller and lifeless than watching a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous movie that has nothing special about it.
