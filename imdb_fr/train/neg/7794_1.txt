This film is awful. Not a quality to this movie. You might think that the gore would be good but it sucks badly. The effects are worse and playing if you can call it is the worst I have ever seen. This film was obviously shot on a camcorder and probably works with a budget of about $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie, watch Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shot in video, Zombie movie like this one, but much better than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It's unassailable and useless. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid film.
