A handful of critics attributed positive comments to this movie. I do not want to challenge their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing this film with other films, especially with the late master Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, without the title of the movie, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original game of death (except that it shares the same character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see how Game of Death 2 was similar to Enter the Dragon. The plots have striking similarities: Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo both have a mission to avenge a member of their family. The two places are similar, in which they are very isolated and surrounded by thousands of black belts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent to the guest rooms of both films). Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's henchman both have a missing hand. Believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a cat in Enter the Dragon, the director has used his imagination to reward Lewis for a domestic monkey! The list continues. <br /> <br /> Regarding the other aspects of the film, such as the screenplay and the acting, I felt it was very mediocre. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to play in the film and pray that they could play. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although combat sequences contain strong elements of acrobatics, they are nonetheless skilfully executed. However, as the plot is insufficient, I could not identify with the characters, so the fight sequences were more exhibitions than to make sense for the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this film is recommended to all martial arts fans, but for those who love a solid action movie, with a good script and strong characters, I do not would not recommend it seriously. . My opinions on this film may seem very biased and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film failed to respect these standards. On the contrary, they imitated a really brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of glory. <br /> <br /> Regarding my evaluation, assigning this film a very severe rating 1 out of 10, the film is viewable on barley and must be grateful for the fight sequences it has made.
