It's not one of the best movies in Arbuckle or Keaton, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all her binge drinking, so she takes him to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed treatment! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and has surgery. Then he escapes and is chased to where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the fact that the employees pursue them, they escape and it becomes obvious that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is quickly taken again. However, he wakes up and everything after the operation is a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton was not as incompetent as he seemed in his dream. <br /> <br /> A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Of course, making fun of people with mental illness is quite low, but at the time it was guaranteed to laugh. I laugh too if there was something funny to answer! A lot of energy and that's all. <br /> <br /> FYI - During one of the chase sequences, Fatty embarks on a men's race of over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances of that?). And shortly after, he returns to a post on which the number 5 has just been painted. As a result, the five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular attendee. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD have appeared upside down on Fatty's shirt but came out of the limelight - a mistake, as they should have realized that the inverted image would have been a back 5.
