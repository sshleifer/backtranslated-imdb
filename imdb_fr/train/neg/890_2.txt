I saw this pile of vignettes regurgitated tonight during a preview screening and I was immediately blown away by the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film almost displays its blind spots. There are no New Yorkers black or gay in love? Or who, for example, knows whites who are involved alone in love? I know this is not the affair of inclusive inclusion, but you can not claim to have a film New York without these fairly widespread members of society. Besides, you know that the people who produced this album thought that Crash deserved this Oscar with his bare hands, so where is everyone? <br /> <br /> Perhaps worse than the bizarre and voluntary socio-economic ignorance were the offending chapters (do you remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs? Neither do I). This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. Bad acting, bad writing, bad mise-en-sc√®ne - all this covers all the possible genres to concern wealthy whites who smoke cigarettes outside chic restaurants. <br /> <br /> But, thank God, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson have finally assembled their teams for the Jumper meeting. And, side note, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged. This, of course, is one thing in terms of its appearance, but has added an incredibly scary horrible vibe to its terribly scripted scene, in front of the poor and charming Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I I had a terrible time choosing my The least favorite scene for the end-of-the-film questionnaire, but it must be Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby's lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like these two actors. I do not consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was mock and look around with disgust, like a 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> The second place in this extremely tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf's dull tone of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not want to say the opposite, I mean against. Against is the only explanation. I realize now that the first sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. HIGHLIGHT. Please keep this in mind when your brain starts flowing from your ear shortly after the opening credits, which seems to be a nod to the first Real World in New York. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and ultimately completely divorced from any real New York idea. <br /> <br /> (The extra star corresponds to the sequence of Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach, because it is actually quite sweet, but it's only a bright spot in what looks like hours of unnecessary torment, masturbatory.)
