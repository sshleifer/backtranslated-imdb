I could not wait to see this movie for a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise", which I found gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was the unpredictable end which, I think, was partly stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was waiting too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman have been fantastic in their roles. Although I do not like the character of Danes, I find it at first very boring. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic in the film. It could have been done so much better, for example, the focus could be more on the conditions of detention and the horror itself. It was a movie too cheerful to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" ending. I could not predict that. But at that moment, I really did not care what had happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
