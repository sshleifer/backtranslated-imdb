<br /> <br /> This film is void. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is in all respects an even poorer film. <br /> <br /> Alida Valli is the only actress in the cast. Alida is one of the great ladies in the history of European cinema. I loved his manic looks in "Suspiria" and "hell" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
