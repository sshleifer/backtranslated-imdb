Mundane dialogue and conspiracy (the same kind of stuff we saw throughout the 1980s fantasy movies), hokey music, and number-painted characters make this game out of the ordinary for all but the most hardcore fans . <BR /> <br /> What saves this movie from the heap of junk is Bakshi's beautiful crutch, rotoscopy, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught drawing artists like him . It's Frazetta ... moving. The violence is spectacular and the artistic direction and animation are unlike any other sword and witch film of this period. <br /> <br /> I like to watch this without sound, playing the soundtrack of Conan's first film.
