Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House, is an atmospheric tale of terror that conveys supernatural phenomena in an old home. The atmosphere is well defined and the chills are well organized. A haunting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 cooler, "The Haunting", stays close to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, they are very few and the terror of the book and shivers are even better on the screen. Black and white photography only adds to the goosebumps of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then, Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, The Haunting's remake hit cinemas - if you could call it a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 film is a mystery in itself, but for now, let's look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> It starts moderately, as most horror movies do. The decor used for Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious. For a few minutes, it seems that the film will actually be a fairly honest story. And then, the first fright comes: a loose harpsichord wire hurts a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). It's hilarious, and to tell the truth, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> From that moment, the film turns spiral. As the film progresses, the acting seems to become a little woody, Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when beheaded by the fireplace). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this film practically, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly tacky and look very old-fashioned. The examples are numerous, so I will not bother to list them. <br /> <br /> In summary, I highly recommend, along with hundreds of others, that you watch the original or alternative cooler, buy the Shirley Jackson novel. But please, stay away from that. And, if you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (as many channels like to watch this movie, not the original one) or rent it cheaply, but please do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final score: 4/10
