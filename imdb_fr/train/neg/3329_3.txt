Take your Frankenstein base film, inject Reanimator (but not the good sides) and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Of course, this has obviously been inspired by the aforementioned films, but it never materializes as a separate thing. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, the film takes place in one night while trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut parts of the body of some women who are blocked and decides, coincidentally, to spend the night at home. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that the acting is bad, nor the direction. Everything here is too standard. Little attempts at humor really work (look at the scene where Hackenstein continues to hide behind his deaf assistant because she would probably be very upset if she saw him squeeze a woman and a needle), but it's barely enough to recommend this film. The music is decent, what blood is decent, and the cast looks pretty good. And for half the time, I was even entertained by this movie. But I never felt it was more than a waste of time. Preventable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
