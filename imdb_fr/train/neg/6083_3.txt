Two types of films we like are (1) westerns and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We should have loved A Man Called Sledge; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this image is unpleasant, embarrassing and stupid from start to finish. Since there is no one in the story (good or bad) to warm up, there is nobody to motivate the suspense necessary for the viewer to remain interested. No camaraderie among the guys who are trying to steal the gold, nor camaraderie among those who try to protect it. Sledge has a pretty girlfriend, but nothing explains why she drool over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this pig without count. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers from an intrusion. Gawdawful musical score, and very bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older films rented at Netflix or Video Vault, this was the bottom of the stone, the only real dud.
