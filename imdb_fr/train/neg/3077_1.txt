Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this movie. He had the genius to produce a film with actors unable to act. On top of that, he chose to write a script based on some kind of bad acid trip that went badly wrong. In summary, you end up with a movie that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suckers and vacuum cleaners. This film was very painful. The pain it provokes is almost equal to that caused by the genitals cut with a spoon, then covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
