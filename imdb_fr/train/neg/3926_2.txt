This Italian film is essentially a soap-opera with a skin. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R", but on the inside band it was "X". The latter has a lot more sense because there is a short scene that was shocking towards the end. Even in the dark, we could see the Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers play completely with this guy - and yes, we could see his penis in his mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "lead actress" had done something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers paraded naked on several scenes but her face was even better than her body. She was beautiful. Unfortunately, the film is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite the looks of Detmers.
