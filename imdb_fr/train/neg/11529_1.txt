Yes, unfortunately, I came across the DVD of this movie and found it incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are void. I mean, let's go, if an orange-haired dork named Orange Sherbert is the best creative idea these guys could find for a character, then they should definitely not be in the filming scene. Bad "costumes", bad "talks", and basically, there is not a "wrestler" on this record with a hint of charisma. <br /> <br /> The "fight" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than that Fools who bounce gently on a trampoline. They also make fun of each other, making this experience a young child's play experience rather than a "deadly fight". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a rather dull Clone of Backyard Wrestling. Only, instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, sneering kids, a terrible sound, and a guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of wrestling, avoid this DVD. It's horrible.
