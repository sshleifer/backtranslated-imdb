The reasons to watch this game ... uh ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It is activated while your channel is surfing and nothing else. - Someone pays you to watch it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and insert the Se7en DVD, rent it, download it on iTunes or put it in your Netflix queue and skip The Flock completely. The flock the same story with some changes. In addition, the editing only criticizes Se7en and ends up getting you out of the story several times. The worst is probably helicopter flying over the desert, with the sound of people chatting on the radio, except that there is no police helicopter flying over it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I call it a flagrant. tear down. If you want to be nice, you can call it a homage movie, go ahead, but watch Se7en.
