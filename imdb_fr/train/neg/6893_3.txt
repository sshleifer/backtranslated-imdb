I had high hopes for this film. The theater monologue is excellent and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge of cinema. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It's quite incredible that 34-year-old actors suddenly play the role of teenagers. The "language games" were hideous and excessive. Nothing in the movie seemed real to me. The end was way too exotic for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think I have lost an hour and a half of my life.
