I went in this movie hoping it would look like The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a plot poorly written and misinterpreted in the movie (with animated cells and CG peptides to boot). However, the film focuses on the "expert" speaking heads who spew a pleasant new age crap between two scenes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is pretty innocent. There is a little real quantum physics at the beginning. He states, for example, that electrons exist both as particle and wave, and that an atom is essentially an empty space. However, the film is a giant leap (and not scientific), claiming that subatomic quantum effects also occur on a large scale. Talking heads go even further. According to them, the following facts are true: <br /> <br /> - Upon the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean, the natives were not able to see his ships because their minds were unable to perceive a something so different. Meditation can reduce the murder rate. -With a positive thought, you can walk on the water. -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was a torture. This film was like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that it was basically that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it could be perceived as a comedy well camped (even if it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not see this movie.
