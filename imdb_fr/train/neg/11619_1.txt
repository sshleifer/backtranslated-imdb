I watched the whole movie, waiting for something to really happen. Maybe it's my fault to wait for evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it strange to tell the Oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and compose a musical theater with him? I did not understand why some elements of the plot were even present: why was the building upstairs, why was there this large stairwell with a perfect place for someone to fall in the back if nobody were going to do it, why have the scenes at all with the father at work, why have such a nice kitchen if you only want to eat to go, why would the boy want to be baptized and should the parents resist instead of the opposite. I see a lot of good reviews for this movie ... was my taste corrupted by going with 70s B-movies and old sci-fi movies?
