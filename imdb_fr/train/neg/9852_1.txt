Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy is inspired by the series "Walking with Dinosuars". Although it is a 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantastic dragons with the T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. In addition to being broadcast on an educational channel instead of saying Science Fiction, it gives an appearance of factual authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> The show alone accounts for about 7.5 out of 10 for entertainment. But the way it is presented, I have to give it a 1/10. Do not get me wrong, I have no problem with fantasy, but their way of expressing it is so wrong. I can really see young children and slow adults believing that they have found a dragon and that this is real. <br /> <br /> I also think that this weakens the big series "Walking with Dinosuars", because we must now see that. with a mind of how fantastic is this mini-series.
