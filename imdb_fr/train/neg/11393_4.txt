Wow, I can not believe that people consider this a "good" movie. I've seen a lot worse, but there are many more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> It's at best a mediocre film. Although the acting is not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were a lot of details that do not show up or are not dealt with. Unfortunately, the main characters appear as complete cowards. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not like the people to whom they are hired. How do we know they are not in love? By the total lack of remorse, the two characters have abandoned their finances. I can think of few more romantic things than the continual escape from the commitment shown by these two. <br /> <br /> The film does not even end with a wedding scene, it is very likely that both will be cold-eyed and will drop other like hot potatoes once a commitment is close. This film actually speaks of two people who can not engage in anything, unlike the previous characters of Cusack, who were more than willing to engage deeply (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this film was the total absence of null turns or interests. At the end of the film, I felt they had not managed to include a climax in the story, which basically corresponds to the whole film: boring. No suspense about whether the two will finish together, no joy when they do, no consequences on their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the mediocrity of this film that they only blame any criticism with "Everyone is too cynical!" The criticism of this film is not cynicism, but simply an impartial examination. There are many other best romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, try these movies, your heart will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Big Blank Point, High Fidelity, Keep Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There's something about Mary (which is a good review of the idealized novel versus today's society).
