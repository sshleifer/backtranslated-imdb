I watched this film very late last night and generally if it is late, I forgive the movies enough. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie, it got worse as the movie progressed. Although I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but I did not find it very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and jaded representation of rural life. If this is your case, the country life is totally different. I must admit that some members of the cast were cute, but the French was really wrong. I must admit that this has tried to draw a good lesson from history, but overall, my recommendation is that no one over 8 years old look at it, it's too boring.
