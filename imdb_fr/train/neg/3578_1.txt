There is absolutely nothing to buy this movie. They took a sordid story, mishandled it, wrote it badly, misunderstood it. He has a bad dialogue misinterpreted in a sinuous and underhanded story. <br /> <br /> As bad as it fails as an art, it fails even more as a trade. Which could have been the target market for this. What age group? Which interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. That I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of bad movies, and this one ranks with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most irreparable of movies I have never seen. All people associated with it should be obliged to converse with VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise. How can you take it and make it worse? I can not think of a meaning.
