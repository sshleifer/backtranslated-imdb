"Dahmer" is an interesting movie although I do not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. It is rather a minor character study that seems strangely sympathetic to the murderer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner describes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film is centered on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well performed by Artel Kayàru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the most interesting character: in love with Dahmer and having once escaped an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is disjointed because it does not really reflect Dahmer's formative years, how events could create the human monster we see on the screen and has no idea of ​​Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims. <br /> <br /> the roles are well played but the story is thin.
