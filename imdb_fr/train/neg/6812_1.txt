From the beginning of this film, you quickly realize that the name of the film has nothing to do with the film itself: watch a naked woman be pursued by very ridiculous masks to servants in the worst garment that I have never seen and all this in subtitles is the kind of movie you should think twice and as the movie goes on, you quickly realize that the vampire is not a vampire, you have to wonder where the title of certain parts of the film comes from. A bit of common sense with Peter and his father, but as the film comes to an end really stupid, you have to think of the end of a movie this way and they have a much better ending if only in their head this is not a movie to look at basically
