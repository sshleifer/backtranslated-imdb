For me, it comes like a soap opera. I suppose that any description of stupid people can be considered as a "social comment". But in the end, I do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters are very friendly or engaging. I did not feel any chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in discomfort. And despite the twisted conclusion provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) reversal of Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, there is not enough history to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology, this story is shady, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly made of wood. This is the least engaging role of Lauren Bacall and one of her worst performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspiring performances, but her character is ugly and her character pathetic. Robert Keith, as a loving and uprooted father of two miscreant adult children, is the friendliest character. The most interesting of all, however, is the severe Robert Wilke in a small role as a bar owner. He is best remembered as an evil hand man in countless westerns, but here he is honest and friendly. <br /> <br /> I take my social comment with an interesting and engaging story and some nice characters, thanks.
