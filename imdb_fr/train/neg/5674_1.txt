My god, what's going on? a film by Uwe Boll and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It is good to note that most of the positive reviews come from beginners to Boll's work. As I have said in previous reviews by Uwe Boll, I only watch his films in the hope that one day he will really succeed in doing something good. I mean ... THIS MUST ARRIVE A DAY! <br /> <br /> Alas, the seed is not that day. I do not really know where to start with the lame attempt of a horror movie that is Seed. The bottom line is that all the sickos in the world are sick because they have watched various illnesses on video or on the network ..... or at least, believes Mr. Boll. I still can not understand why it was necessary to film real abuse and killing of animals in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is sick and likes to watch such things ... but I do not understand why Mr. Boll thought that inserting REAL images into the movie would work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm ..... well, for my part, I'm not afflicted and I can not see anything on film. I DO NOT DO, however, find the use of true animal cruelty images entertaining in the least. If you tried to shock me, it did not work. It reminded me of how confused the world was because of such things and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making movies. This kind of context may have worked for the 70/80 (Cannibal Holocaust) movies, but not for the current market. <br /> <br /> That said, we can move on to the fact that Uwe managed to give the movie a very cheap appearance, like BloodRayne 2. You may find that there was not much money available for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll does not really care about making a decent story while we are being treated for boring shots of police looking at different videos of Seed victims during First 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends with an accelerated decomposition of the victim. It is very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the early childhood scene because it is laughable and is another inexpensive "shock" factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be treated with police officers who are crossing a very dark house to catch the seed. The lighting is horrible and Uwe has the old "I'm not using the camera" fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch the police die even more stupidly until you get caught. This scene is so stupid that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, the cop told Seed that he could have shot him. For some unknown reason, the cop does not shoot him. Since Seed is a sicko who kills children as well as adults, you would have thought at this stage of the script that the meaning would prevail. <br /> <br /> We are now treated in a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops burying Seed alive (and they know he's alive .. why not shoot him in the head ?? ??), followed by Seed out of the ground then kill a random woman with a hammer and then remove it from the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I want you to understand is that it's just STUPID! It's not even a stupid Hollywood horror ... but just idiotic. Uwe Boll can not lead ****. Anyone with an ounce of taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this film and finds it entertaining in any way must look at himself seriously as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again, we are treated like a piece of shit UB misinterpreted, directed, lit, produced.
