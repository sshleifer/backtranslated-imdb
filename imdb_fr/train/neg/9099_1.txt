This review also contains a spoiler from the first movie. Therefore, if you have not seen any movie and you want but do not want spoilers, please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> The film is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first cruel intentions. The actors they represented portray Christian, of Ryan Phillippe, and Kathryn, of Sarah Michelle Gellar, are very bad substitutes. Neither can adopt the rich and snobbish childish attitude that the original actors have adopted. It's absolutely appalling that some dialogues are textual - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen to them enough, you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if it was really Christian and Kathryn's first meeting, then why did Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He was supposed to be in love for the first time with the original movie (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the link with the photograph / comment "You could be a model" at the end was totally lame and did not add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe they made a cruel intention 3.
