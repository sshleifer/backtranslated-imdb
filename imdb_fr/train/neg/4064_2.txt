This film is extremely boring, it tells the story of a woman owning a gas station and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really "kept the reality" and it looks like a camera that follows a woman throughout her life. I had to watch other films from this director during a class, the others were not so boring. This movie was also watched for an assignment ... better to be bored with a good rating !! All in all, unless it's necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not neglect the other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not neglect other films about Africa, they are generally good, especially when made by a Western director.
