****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> Kyser and his mediocre group, host of a radio quiz, are an excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to collect a paycheck in this bland, parody of a haunted house that is sporatically watchable. Lugosi is a mystic whose sessions are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to confuse the fortune of an heiress. Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes false mediums, but it turns out that they are both in a plot with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and her group of "kids" in their thirties are discovering the truth with the least possible humor along the way. Not recommended to all, but to the completeist of absolute horror.
