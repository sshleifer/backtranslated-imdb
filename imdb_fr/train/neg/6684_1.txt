This should be re-titled "The Curious Case of Unscrupulous Filmmakers Who Poorly Introduced a Non-Horror Buzzer Like a Shocking Movie." It's a long and boring story of hazing in a fraternity, a gag so transparent that even Delta House's Flounder could see through. We can forgive Jeff East, actor in contribution phase, to take any work. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who has already played for movie heavyweights like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but, fortunately, not on DVD. Badly represented garbage like this belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
