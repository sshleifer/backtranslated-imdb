This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema !! I could not wait for it to end. To make matters worse, he receives a 12A certificate so that you do not see anyone being shot, just bodies that collapse on the ground, even Babban getting killed has been cut off !!! Too many scenes were cut to attract the youngest viewers, because I think the directors knew that the flop would be catastrophic !! Playing Amitabh was great but this wannabe 'Basanti' and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can not even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not look at this for free anymore and I advise all other readers to read it to do the same thing you were warned !!
