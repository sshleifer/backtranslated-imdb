What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Does he really think he's funny? Well, it's funny to see his confidence in himself being funny. The man has no identity. I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he's really trying to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and it comes out of the passages where he looks a little like Denzel, with that macho-s ** t attitude and then, suddenly, becomes Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy-stupid comic. There is no personal contact with all that, I mean it does not contribute anything to the personality he's trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He is really Mr. Dull-boy in person. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping for Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to get into celebrity, like Don Cheadle for example, but maybe pathetic Jamie represents the generation better who remixes the old.
