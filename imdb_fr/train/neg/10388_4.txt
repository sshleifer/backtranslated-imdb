In reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to be a little disfigured, but I did not think it was SO bad. In fact, I saw a lot worse. <br /> <br /> "The house where the evil habitat" is a ghost story of a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who moves to an old house in Japan . They do not know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and lover, then committed suicide a hundred years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan to replay the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was corny, but I saw worse in my day. The ghost sequences were a bit overexploited, we see translucent blue characters appear randomly around the family and grab their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts of this movie reminded me of the ghosts of Disneyland's haunted merry-go-round. I may be wrong, but after seeing this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this movie had taken it a bit off. The old Japanese house where a brutal murder took place, a ghostly activity, curses inflicted at home, etc. But maybe I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it's a beautiful ghost story. Do not be discouraged, but if you like that kind of thing and it happens on TV, you can try it. 4/10.
