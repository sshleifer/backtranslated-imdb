I found myself very caught in this movie, at least in the beginning, and all the credit that I give to this film is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic !! But that's where it ends. It seems that I know very well who the killer is, and I like when a movie is able to break me completely, but I lied to myself, they lied to me, they always lied to me, they led you in the same direction decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they did not attribute it at all, it was not misleading to write and plan very badly, someone did not think at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the film It would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that directed you, they also seemed to answer nothing, why did Jane (Maria) set fire to the teacher's house . <br /> <br /> It's a shame. as I felt, it started as a relatively good movie.
