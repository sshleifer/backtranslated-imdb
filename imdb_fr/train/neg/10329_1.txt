I try to imagine the terrain for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking about Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, I'm thinking of that girl playing Faith in Angel, dressed in shiny black leather - or a girl like her, leaving this one with us ... Only ... I'm going to do it without intrigue, without dialogue, without character, without decent action or without budget, with just a loud detonation and a hot girl in shiny black leather riding a big, throbbing bike., right? "<br /> <br /> Flashy, superficial, sad, without formula, without passion, tedious, dull, mute, without humor, discouraging, barely competent. Live anime action without any action, or even no life. SF like Joe Fanboy likes it, actually. :(
