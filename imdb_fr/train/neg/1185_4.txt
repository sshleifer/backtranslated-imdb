Another variation and improvisation of the famous and beloved children's tale, La Bete (1975), aka The Beast, tries to imagine (in a very graphic way and what may seem shocking and disturbing but actually rather ridiculous and comic) the beast ? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to deepen this film. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and gloomy exploration of topics such as sexual frustration, nostalgia, fulfillment, or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of a parody of every genre he touches or even mentions, even if some shocking moments in all departments will remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long (far too long) scene between a young aristocratic woman and the so-called horrible but laughable I've ever seen in the movie creature with really impressive ... well anatomy, is tuned to Scarlatti's clavichord music and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed at the laughter about the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is who is the target audience of the film? For an erotic picture, it's too wordy; for an art film - there are too many breathtaking scenes of pure madness and I would say an abrupt end. IMO, the creator of the film did not want it to be a serious drama. Parody of art house / horror / erotic, it's funny and certainly original. Laugh well and try not to look deep. This story of curious beauties and lascivious Beasts is certainly not recommended for co-viewing with children. The opening chain that can shock an unprepared viewer much more than the famous bestiality scene can be used successfully on the Discovery channel for the program "In the Animal World - The Habits and Rituals of Horses".
