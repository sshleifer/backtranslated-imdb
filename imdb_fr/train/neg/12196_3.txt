The actors played their roles very well, especially the mother. However, as the movie progressed, I found that I was watching it more for acting and not because I cared less about people. And, sometimes, I felt irritated by the irresponsible and passive approach of parenting displayed again and again. The girl is a 17-year-old shallow skank whose main ambition is to litter famous men and become a dancing nymph (with many "shakes"). The son is a guy with low self-esteem who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much so that he organizes a drug party late in the movie. Both husband and wife are bored, but rather than putting energy into their obsolete relationship, they would rather seek new partners (although the woman chooses badly, because the man to whom she "throws herself "happens to be gay --- OOPS!). I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had trouble dealing with those shallow jerks. I think the author has tried to demonstrate the total banality and hollow of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are NOT typical of the average western family, it sounds dishonest.
