At first glance, this movie should be a good movie, a great cast, a great storyline, and one of the best Hollywood movies behind the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why another 8 years before Spacey decides to try again to make a film. This film fails on so many levels. In a film where there is not much action and where most of the scenes are shot in several places, it is imperative that the director ensures suspense and continuity. Not so much here, the big distribution is horribly underused, no more than the much regretted John Spencer, the plot is so fucked up and nothing that you have seen in a hundred other movies. There is so little character development that you end up not worrying about any of the protagonists. At least we know that Spacey has a lot of mates and influences in Hollywood studios to get by with such a mediocre film.
