Let me give you a brief overview of the film: a rotten and rude kid named Max falls on a radio containing Kazaam: a hitting genius. Like all geniuses, he grants 3 wishes but, having a good heart, also helps Max in his personal life, because he has to cope with bullying and a father involved in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam rapps from time to time (also highlighting Shaq's lamentable rap skills). <br /> <br /> This film proves what we all know: athletes must stay in the sport. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this movie wastage is horrible. The characters are either unfathomable or stupid, the plot does not even deserve to be mentioned, the dialogue is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Damn, even though Denzel Washington was playing Kazaam, this movie would still be a joke. I know the film only attracted EVERYONE because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. Honestly, I can not think of anything positive about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the necessary time to make this film and practice free throws.
