We are in 1978 and, of course, there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be upset and the 75 000 places will be filled, but there are fewer happy players on the field! This is done for the Super Bowl TV movie. It's not much more, but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors making an appearance (for the moment), probably the most notable is Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, everything that Selleck brings to the screen is quickly overtaken by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's an idiotic story about the Super Bowl bet. PJ Jackson is accused by "New York" (read mafia) for making sure that the game ends in his favor, in this case a bet of 10 000 000 â‚¬ PJ is innocent enough and seems to have trouble buying by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to collapse for him. Another person, Lainie, unsuspected, takes things in hand. For a while, the mystery of the murders is not known with certainty, but it is revealed quite clearly during the last murder that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's watchable. The acting is correct, and the shooting is OK. At least, there were no car chases typical of the 70s (they have no place here). Just keep an open mind about the stereotypes of the past and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
