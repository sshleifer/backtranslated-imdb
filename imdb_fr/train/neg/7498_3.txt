Spike Lee has been in decline since his early success and this mess does not help. I often watched my watch hoping that the film would end or go straight to the point. Lee's first film with an all-white cast is a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose? That Italians swear and love awesome sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go in a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame character of Godfather only adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several of Lee's films, including "Do the Right Thing". This film is a waste of time.
