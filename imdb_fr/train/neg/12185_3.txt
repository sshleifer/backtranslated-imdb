What has ever owned Martin Scorcese to do this movie again? And not only did he redo it, completely destroyed? The foolish decision to transform the character portrayed by Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and that says a lot) as a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of the attitudes of Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese in particular) - attitudes that compel writers think that the best way to make a foolish character is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this film is awful. <br /> <br />
