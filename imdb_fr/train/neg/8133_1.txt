The movie is as much fun as watching the sun.Sheriff Pataki is a retarded person who likes nothing better than sitting on his hindquarters, sounding smoke from his swollen cigar and drinking water. Alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage craves everything called "the Blood" that actually looked like a fruit punch. <br /> <br /> Most of the plot seemed very horrible to call even that piece of shit a movie.The rest of the characters In this movie, the loss of time is total, the end is terrible, the outlines are ridiculous and the scenes are terrible. What more can I say to viewers? My advice would be to get vaccinated against rabies if you've ever watched the movie. This film can give you foam in your mouth if you have not got your last shots.
