This is the worst show. Adult buntch acting like kids no humor anything. Even Sesame Street has a better and more adult humor than friends. "Friends" is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen on TV and I sat in front of the tube watching Friends. It lacks the intelligence of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful ridiculous pomposity that characterizes "Frasier". The characters of "Friends" seem designed to make them repulsive idiots. . <br /> <br /> The unintelligent broadcast is completely devoid of character. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric - well intentionally. writers may be forced to aim lower than their abilities so as not to confuse loyal "Friends" friends.)
