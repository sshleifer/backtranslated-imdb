Trying to compare or represent this "swill" as anything "Hitchcockian" is a frantic attempt to trick Hitchcock fans into wasting $ 7 on this movie ... Low Movie Low History Low Script. <br /> <br /> No real suspense, no chills. You wait throughout the weakness of this film the big gain or even the least benefit ... It only remains for you to think, what was it then. <br /> <br /> And please, leave enough movement to make HIP "alternative lifestyles" and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the acting is? Williams did a better job than Peter Pan and "Mork". But it was MUCH more innocent ...........
