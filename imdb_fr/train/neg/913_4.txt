OK now, let's see. What was funny about the first movie? I know, people with fun accents, people falling into the water, stupid boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie, they twisted the accent part to the maximum, nothing good. Many people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, but not good. Boatcrash, check. Fun comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. In addition, there are also the personalities they can follow in this film. This film should focus on what is happening on the water, not on land. I'm sorry to say that there is too much distance between the funny roles and that the film's sponsors are exploited to the maximum. Not good. In all, I give him four out of ten because it has fun parts.
