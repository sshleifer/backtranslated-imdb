Where to start? How about the wrong synopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the worrisome Weapon X program." /> <br /> Its epic and violent past is exceptionally nonviolent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so obscured that it's hard to understand how they relate. We are projected from a point of the opening scene that shows them as children on the run, a montage of war scenes in which they fought throughout their lives, and finally to the present where they are part. of a hardcore government team of assassins. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that shows their relationship as brothers. Nothing complicated is planned so that we can believe that it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and brutal. We are immersed in a love story so fast that it's over before you can blink. Having introduced the character, Silverfox is killed about fifteen minutes later. We wonder why we should be concerned about it. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For an essential element of this story of revenge, romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Strangely, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves it in the woods to rot when he goes in search of Sabertooth. As a romantic, it's out of character but yet necessary to serve the plot by getting a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Regarding the Weapon X program, let's just say that after the painful disabling Wolverine procedure is operational. He ends up arriving at a couple at once convenient and yet deeply in love. Surprisingly, Kent's mom and dad do not care to find a naked and sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder that fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comics, the main reason why Wolverines' amnesia had tormented him was partly based on the fact that he was viciously naughty and cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and pursue his more positive lifestyle of fighting against the wicked of the world alongside his teammates? <br /> <br /> As stated in X2: X-men United when Stryker revealed some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be upset if he had known about the evil works they did together. This film puts the team in quite a good position, on the condition that they do not do much. No disturbing violence, no ruthless action, they only harass some natives living in foreign countries during the ten or fifteen minutes they spend on screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not at all a perverse man under Stryker. Instead, he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother, Sabertooth, who was therefore the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was. Finally, he simply leaves all together. <br /> <br /> No duality conflict here. <br /> <br /> Idiotically, DELETING this conflict of characters from good and evil DULLED the story. They might as well have given him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were a ton of other mistakes in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the ludicrous Deus Ex Machinas a script. <br /> <br /> Magic bullets that erase memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently, they are the only thing to knock Wolverine down. Yet this was apparently forgotten when agents were sent down with bullets and bombs that would not work at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that he tried to focus on Wolverine. throwing a ton of other mutants who did nothing at all. The interesting characters were simple bandages and did nothing for the story. Most were in the movie for a maximum of 5 to 10 minutes and yet you would like to see more and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (the Blob but not the comic version) can hit a launcher a tank missile with little or no physical damage at all, but a simple impulse from Wolverines is enough for the stun? <br /> <br /> The cyclops optical beams (which instead of being a force of concussion are now more similar to lasers) can burn through buildings, but when they are shot directly at Sabertooth, they simply flip into the ground without even damaging his clothes. Trenches in adamantium cover everyone? <br /> <br /> The mutant Gambit (which defies gravity), instead of using its signature cards, is transformed into a kind of crazy acrobat. In a badly mounted scene, he is knocked out by Wolverine ... then, surprisingly, a few minutes later, he finds himself on a roof turning towards Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, fled a few blocks, climbed into a building, then returned to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a match is a mystery that remains to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some have excused him. The weakness of the film claiming that it was made from a cartoon and should therefore be low on the character and heavy on the flash. The idea that this film is a comic film is fragile and superficial because of this is inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The source material of the cartoon, the REAL origin of Wolverine ... is a story that deserves to be presented on the screen. . He does not cover his past with sugar and does not treat the reader as unscrupulous drug addicts. It's a well-made story, and although picked up again and adjusted over time, it started with Barry Windsor-Smith's WEAPON X. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
