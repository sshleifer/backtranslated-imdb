What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this movie - after seeing the excerpts and thought it might be funny. FALSE! This film lasts about 90 minutes. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can not go out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's naked bottom can buy part of this movie. The special effects ..... are not. I was almost expecting to see the harness and the wires holding Uma in his flight scenes. And when the effects people apparently could not control the fight or flight scenes at a speed faster than the ball, they all covered with a whirlwind swirling screen that hid the terrible effects pretty well. Wilson's boyfriend was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with Uma or his office colleague. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not funny. I guess I was expecting too much of these actors. None of the characters were really nice, so I ended up not worrying about anything anymore. The only memorable shows were the kids who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall, a super stinko movie - I would not even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
