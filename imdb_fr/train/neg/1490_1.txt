First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress of this movie and she is really awful. This film has all the clich√©s of horror movements in the imagination, and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comic jock (not) horny. The cool snob chick. The scary local color guy. The parental type couple. The virgin chick that never surprisingly dies in these movies. The dialogue is terribly awful and comes with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost as if you want them all to die sooner. I saw the rough editing of this movie some time ago, but somehow it was getting worse. Of course, the funniest thing here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but that's not even worth renting this dog. Avoid at all costs.
