It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not do it. Not only did he leave the plot behind him, he invented his! The things he chose to leave inside were so unbelievably incredible that I was happy that he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was fuzzy, incoherent and agitated to say the least. I do not mean anything bad about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but it's pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a Kramer from the middle of the nineteenth century, and the less we said about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 adaptation of the BBC. Regarding the scriptwriter, I think he read the notes of the cliff!
