Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon arrived, there has been much talk of a revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe it. People who are now making movies at HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name that gets his name here, but he spends most of the film just smiles silly and throws a coin. He flips the coin over and over again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays the role of a police officer who chases the pretty boy. But again: who knows why? There is a pretty actress in the female lead who runs a kind of society and she has to pay a ransom or something else, but she seems to prefer to be in a spa or mall than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? We do not care?
