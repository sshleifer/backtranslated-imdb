Why did everyone who saw this film think that it is their responsibility to tell us if they are shooters or not? This point is totally indifferent to any argument to oppose this movie dog. <br /> <br /> I think sports movies fall into two categories; movies well done on the human spirit and competitions, and "By the sword". <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie could never decide what he wanted to be, a moving drama to try to be the best of his life, competitive motivational charge or martial arts movie . In the end, he made none of these attempts convincingly or completely to give me an ounce of care. <br /> <br /> For the record, I am also a fencing instructor (and officially as bad as the rest). But putting a bad fence in a movie does not automatically make it bad. I mean, look at Star Wars (episodes 4 to 6, good movies, bad fencing). I liked these movies. But when you put bad sports in a bad movie for some reason, people think that only purists think it's a lame effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comments on the small problem of fencing. It's just a bad movie. In the end, this film has nothing to offer fencing fans, moviegoers or those who have a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie and I have to think, If only I watched the Mighty Ducks. I know it's time to get around the argument with the theater director to get my money back and see if there's anyone in the lobby who will somehow get me two hours of my life .
