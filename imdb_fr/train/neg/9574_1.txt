It must be one of the most outrageously stupid movies I've ever seen in my life. Just when I think I've seen the most stupid scene in history, an even more silly and weird scene appears. I think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or better yet, for its spoken language ... or maybe the guy who makes the statue of the virgin mother rise on a jeep windshield stuck in her throat . Oh, make decisions ...
