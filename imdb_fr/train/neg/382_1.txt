Hi Bollywood and the directors! <br /> <br /> Really, this is the ultimate limit of the ultimate sacrifice made by an Indian woman! <br /> <br /> See the current state of affairs in India, where women become more vicious day after day and very possessive of their husbands - female filmmakers can also be called Uncle Scars (see movie The Lion King) have come up with a whole new concept of how the guarded woman and her wife can live together to their happiness. after sharing everything between them ... including spermikins !! <br /> <br /> History: A married couple - very happy - but accident happens accidentally and his wife has a miscarriage - lost the fetus with the ability of his life to become a mother! <br /> <br /> From now on in India, step-parents usually hunt the daughter-in-law if she does not give them an heir! Thus, the woman approaches an important plan - the surrogate ... but the scientists intervene - "Of course, artificial insemination" - NO, says the artist (the director actually) - "The neighborhood will learn that his daughter-in-law is sterile, so they will look for a surrogate mother !! <br /> <br /> Neighbors! The society !! Ladies the same who are watching Fashion TV day and night - Watch girls aged 14 to 40 years old ... in bra and panties - well these neighbors are suddenly taking over in family planning and decision making !! <br /> <br /> The woman is sending her husband back to a beer bar where the girls are dancing on the stage - mostly uneducated and illiterate - But men like women who can satisfy their ego! <br /> <br /> He hires the main dancer in the pub - asks him to carry his baby - in exchange for money - she accepts - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and child ari√©e - both coexist in the same house - at the same time, the prostitute also has a taste of household ife - so many caring people around her - she misses them all and cries silently !! Meanwhile - no one in the family knows that the real beautiful girl is walking with a pillow under her petticoat !! - the mother or other elderly people never took her for health exams - and they did not try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!
