As a real fan of Elvis, this film is a real embarrassment and the scenario is a disaster. The film begins with the magnificent son "Stay Away" and the landscapes of the Grand Canyon give the viewer hope for something special. Elvis enters the scene and his talent is a considerable waste of time, especially for the rest of the songs presented. I sat through this movie twice, just to make sure it's a scrap piece !!! 1 of 10 !!!
