In Steven Segal's films, he is at the bottom of the ladder. His best was only fodder for bored teens. He tips the scales, then falls. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can not ruin it by telling you the end. You already know how all of Steven Segal's movies end if you've seen one. Here you are. He is a super-agent of the government who knows how to go out of his way to decide, instead of killing him, to blow his head until he no longer remembers the squat. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is found by his former general who needs his only man on a million experience to recover a stealthy plane that was delivered to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a rogue driver of the Air Force who, surprise surprise, formed Segal. All the heroes, except the character of Segal and his dark girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world at once or falls to the ground. It does not matter. Made with surplus flying film from the Air Force and the Navy. And a lot of boom-boom. Get Popeye cartoons instead.
