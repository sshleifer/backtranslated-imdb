Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi), a university student, is struggling with nightmares of a ghoul living in a cellar in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his hand, spitting a worm, a ghoul tearing his chest and being roasted in the fire. After his friends have seen him levitate "six feet" long on his bed, an attentive and obsessed teacher of the occult (Donna Denton) suggests sneaking to Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course, they leave in the middle of the night when no one is there to help when the situation gets out of hand! <br /> <br /> The group crashes, Alex's brother, Richard (Tom Reilly) becomes possessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil, of "Mickey", appears as the ghost of Sammy Mitchell, singer of the group "Bodybag". She teaches Alex how to levitate out of his body and do a rock dance interspersed with repeated nightmare sequences to smother the time elapsed. All the victims present themselves as phantasmagorical ghosts in the manner of Griffin Dunne's character in AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The screenplay is full of intrigue, nerdy dialogues and lame comedy attempts. A good work on the currencies and a opening credits (both of Ernest D. Farino) are the only points that deserve to be earned. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
