The statistics for this movie have been well documented. There is no doubt about that! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is not surprising that this film has received the praise he has received. Al Gore is definitely an actor. He looks so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there is political information and references to his political career dotted throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only speaks but works. as well as. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he lowered the White House thermostat and warmed up wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we must conserve energy and claim that we create. global warming as he travels in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much pollution does his jet generate? How much energy is needed to heat Gore's pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and making a point of turning off anything that is not used. But if we did, the utility would respond to a 50% reduction in energy by calling it a "50% revenue loss" and recovering its losses by raising rates by 50%. So, "just switch off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled call for Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet Earth.
