** SPOILERS ** A bit ridiculous for the TV movie, sexy and middle-aged Isabelle Collins researcher Susan Tucci numbers all the men she comes in contact with. They first earn their hearts, then their wallets, then, when they are no longer needed, thrown into the wastebasket like a used kleenex tissue. <br /> <br /> The first victim of Isabelle is none other than the violent, preventing Isabelle from plundering her bank account, her husband, Stewart, John O'Hurley. It is later in the film that Isabelle becomes very friendly with the former plumber and yacht salesman Richard Davis, Philip Casnoff, that she has, without telling him, put the contract to Richard, a patient of love, for a contract on the life of her husband, who knew nothing. Daggett, Nicholas Campbell, upon his return from prison, to do the job with Stewart Richard, quickly discovers that he did not receive exactly what he paid, $ 15,000.00 in cash, for. <Br /> <br /> Becoming a little too greedy Daggett not only blew up Stewart's brain, but also took out a solid gold watch that Stewart had offered him to lead his life. The watch was easily attributed to Daggett while he was trying to pledge it at a local jewelery store where he was quickly arrested. While Doggett proved himself and hired him to hit Stewart, he had to wait for the long arm of the law to stop Stewart's, hiring Doggett, the husband of the killer Isabelle, a former plumber and yacht salesman. Richard Davis! Davis's arrest by the police came at the moment when Isabelle and he were giving her wedding vows at a local church! <br /> <br /> Isabelle manipulates everyone, exclusively men who fall head over heels to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work. Always playing the role of the housewife, widow, lover or even the naive client, Isabelle seems to lead a charming life, always a step ahead of the law and the police. Whatever she does, Isabelle covers her up so well that it is almost impossible to pin her down on all the crimes she commits, through them, through a second part in the film. <br /> <br /> After kissing, figuratively and literally, her first husband, Steven, her second husband, for less than ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or Richard's lawyer, the Attorney Gavin Kendrick, Kamar From Los Rey, Isabelle knows that it's only a short time before the police are wise with her. Since the D.A was able to convince Richard and Kendrick to present evidence against him, Isabelle now knows that everything is fast approaching for her last move. By putting everything in order, by transferring all her money abroad, Isabelle and her daughter Ruby, Lauren Collins, aged 10, go to the passport office to obtain authorizations, passports, to leave the country . <br /> <br /> It is then that the small and intelligent Isabelle makes her first, or even her last and fatal mistake in the film. The passport clerk, Don Carrier, tells Isabelle that she will have to wait 48 hours and that Ruby's passport is erased! Just the time the police can find it and stop it! An extravagant ending that goes against almost everything and all the ethics that characterize a film noir or a detective film. An end that will not only surprise your mind but your concept of what is good and what is wrong in the world!
