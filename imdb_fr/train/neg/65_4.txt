I do not quite understand the rating given to Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY nice to give him a 4 out of 10. What could have been a wonderful story with a set of more or less decent actors has become a Total prank my eyes. There are so many clich√©s in this movie that women's hair is horrible and most scenes are more than unrealistic or seem wrong. There is no real passion in this film but a group of actors surpassing all the limits that hurt. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too bad to be really touched, so in my eyes it's just not good. Looking at this, I could not believe how much such a thing was on my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was still OK and it had just been lost in the translation? Who knows. Certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen and it certainly is not in a good way! Sorry.
