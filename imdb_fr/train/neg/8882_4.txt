It would be too ironic to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave, but this is an undeniably indistinct combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) via THE DIABOLICS (1954); Although still observable in itself, it is so clich√© that it causes chuckles instead of expected chills. However, thanks to the disarray of the British film industry at the end of the 1970s, even a scenario as poor as this one could attract 10 stars: Cliff Robertson (the accomplice husband), Jean Simmons main title), Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's half-sister), Simon Ward (as an enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as an infamous physician), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons best friend and wife of Jayston), Flora Robson (the housekeeper), David Tomlinson (the notary reading Simmons' will) and, perhaps most surprisingly, Jack Warner (as gravestone sculptor) - although the most of them have nothing to do, I'm sorry to say!
