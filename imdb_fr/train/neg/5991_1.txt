ba ba ba boring ...... it's next to the battle ground in the drowsiness of science fiction. genie francis (aka laura general hospital) has a small role as a reporter and this should tell you that this movie must be bad .... there is ben kingsley (an award-winning actor in an academy) in this stinker and a few other decent actors. You must be wondering what possessed them to decide to make this movie horrible. The music rises and falls dramatically as a major dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are mediocre too and seem really dated. All actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism in their dialogue. I could go on and on about it being a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's so bad it's funny, but it's just right. Avoid unless you want to fall asleep.
