I went to watch this movie knowing that it was not going to be great. but what I witnessed was too horrible for words. I do not want to be hard, it's just that the movie was terrible. All in all, there were some special, nil effects, the acting was not too bad, but was not good either, and sasquatch itself was like ... well, not sasquatch . In my opinion, the best sasquatch film is Harry and the Henderson. it's not violent nor horror, but it has the best representation of sasquatch. at least it's a costume and not a cgi scam half ass. Do not see this movie unless you are desperate or really like someone in the movie. or go watch boondock saints, it's MUCH better.
