Over the past 10 years, I have worked in 3 independent professional wrestling organizations, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different TV wrestling programs and made voices and commentaries for many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER witnessed the absolute level of amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and poor production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Quoting this as a fight video of ANY type is a pure abuse of the term. Filmed with cheap video cameras, these are basically homemade videos showing kids arguing in backyards. The quality of the sound is bad, the quality of the video is bad and the acting is awful. "Wrestlers" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks. They hit each other with a variety of objects and mimic mid-way wrestling movements. Sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on a trampoline in the backyard. ALL are misinterpreted and executed with a shameless lack of fighting skills. In short, do not bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
