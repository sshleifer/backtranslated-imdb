This is not a bad start for the program, but what a slap for true law enforcement. The worst of the series is that it tries to pretend to be a reality - and is anything but. The men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better than that. What's next, medical school in a minute? Charo performing lipo? Charles Grodin assistant on a hip replacement? Come on ... show a little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are broadcasting the program as planned. Police Academy = High School Gymnasium? Wrong editing (how often can they use Taco Bell car shots in the background?), Cheesy siren effects (the same loop adds nausea to every call, be it code or not), and last but not least - more security issues for agents than you could do. <br /> <br /> If I want to see fabricated police work and fake good cops, I'll look at RENO 911.
