I was delighted to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a film in Cebuano. (This is not a "dialect", as most Filipinos wrongly say, Cebuano and Tagalog are as incomprehensible as French and Spanish for each other.) But I was greatly disappointed when seeing this movie. As a Canadian of Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the resumption of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was also excited that it was not another stupid action movie or melodrama, because Filipinos love this kind of movies. But alas, I have not managed to change. <br /> <br /> The Panaghoy serves as a journey for the ego for Cesar Montano. Montano of course plays the hero of the film. And when I say "hero", I mean in the most stereotypical way. its function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bolon to victory against the Japanese. His character has neither depth nor complexity. It just fits the mold of the hero. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; they all correspond to their role of biscuit cutter. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow / meditative films, but this film was moving slowly. He did not really meditate on anything. It's not because a film has a historical theme, a drama and its slowness that it's a well done movie. <br /> <br /> The American actor Philip Anthony is particularly annoying. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan movie industry, he really should have thought about it. He said he wanted to make films in Visayan that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, and so on. But, in reality, this film would have been booed and hissed at such festivals. To get Visayan films into the mainstream, he would at least have had to make a film that would have attracted an audience, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he did not think about the question of what kind of film was awarded in Cannes. A film intended for the public would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that now Visayan movies will not be produced long because of this movie. If I ever told a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies, of course, I would get an answer like, "The Visayans do not make good movies, did not you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, that's ridiculous because it's an example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example anyone today would be likely to see. <br /> <br /> An example of meditative films, not just slow, are: the film Tagalog Blackout or The Straight Story by David Lynch. I do not like to promote tagalog because it is tirelessly and unfairly promoted and pushed into the throat of Filipinos non-tagalogs, but to be able to call a cat a cat, I say that Blackout is a very good movie. These films are largely based on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Wordsless images are used to convey the story. But I am changing the definition for the sake of these two films in the sense that these films use wordless images to reflect the mood of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take panoramic views of the landscape, they created the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ???
