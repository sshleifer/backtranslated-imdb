No wonder most actors wanted to never have made this film. It's just ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheesy lines while brilliant classic showroom cars constantly surround a restaurant that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. Students fight with the main deranged to prevent them from setting fire to a bronze statue of civil war. The riots of Watts with a cast of ... uh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag as he pretends to be a Mary Hartman lookalike with the most boring smile since "Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan's words to the naughty teacher with a swinging pointer and a very bad facelift. The drunk virgin Rick Schroder sits in a rocket for children on his last night before entering the service. Silly, sneering schoolgirls dress up in leopard stretch pants, walk on the 'Shindig' set, sing horribly and play an important role in the music business. And who wrote this convincing dialogue ?: "I'm going to Burkley's and I'm wearing flowers in my hair" .... "I think I've found someone to buy Woody from Stick!" ... "These people are" animals "!" "These people are my" family "as the Shirelles sing" Mama Said "Oh brother, what a mess It's like a" refrigerator madness "of the 60s except that it's not even funny.
