As for the spaghetti westerns, I would put This Man Can not Die on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the film is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and brilliance of some of the SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma needed to succeed him. With one notable exception, the rest of the distribution is not particularly good. The management is not inspired and offers very few moments that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> The casting exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only asset of this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, his screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page of This Man Can not Die is incorrect Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson is the character of Melin, I do not know how Rosalba Neri could be confused with a certain John Bartha. IMDb credits for the movie.)
