The special charisma of Martin Kosleck brings some credibility to his frustrated artist figure. He imbues his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing person. The character manages to portray himself as a real person and not as a villain typical of movie B. <br /> <br /> The story has nothing to tell and many scenes are dark. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton in Creeper. Kosleck's talkative and philosophical philosophical character contrasts with Hatton's discrete monosyllabic approach. The Creeper character has not evolved much beyond a basic monster level, but Hatton suggests untapped possibilities and puzzles you as to his past. <br /> <br /> This film was often on Shock Theater when I was a child, so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it. Anyway, it's worth a visit once for those who love Forties horror movies.
