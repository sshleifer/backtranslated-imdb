I did not even know this film existed until shortly after I saw Blade: Trinity, I was joking on the Trinity board when I saw a user say that the Wes Craven series is much better than the "shit" from Blade, so I did my quick searches: checked the scores on IMDb and RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere during the search, I discovered that it was a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that the advice of Wes Craven Dracula was very well attended. for this film which is a big contradiction with the scores that I saw. <br /> <br /> Now, let's do a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000 and not having liked it at all, then seeing Dracula's scores: Ascension lowered my expectations again, but I'm the kind of person who really needs to watch the movie myself . (any movie) so that I can make my own opinion. <br /> <br /> A number of things I learned when I started watching this movie was that the budget was low, so because of that, to ignore a lot of v / fx and tell me that it's going to be offset by the story and the acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the actors in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh good God ?? This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it pretty ridiculous, the poor audio synchronization of the re-recording of dialogue in a few scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Of course, they knew all the vampires and some basic things. Luke even had a book about it, but did that prevent them from wanting to be "infected" on purpose? No, it's worse than slasher movies where the girl has to get out of the shower and check the sound she hears with nothing more than a towel. <br /> <br /> I also had to blink at some point, because I do not know how Dracula had clothes on his body, especially since he's very wild and angry and that if I were in this situation, I would not want to be the one who dresses him. <br /> <br /> So, the film ends like any intermediate film of a trilogy ?? that's not the case, it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I now have to wait for the third 'Legacy' installment. Oh, the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
