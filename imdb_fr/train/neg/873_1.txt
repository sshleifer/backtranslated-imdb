An executive, very successful in his professional life but very incapable in his family life, meets a boy with Down syndrome who escaped from a residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and the seemingly less intelligent character will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument, Amelie's atmosphere and sentimental music, I do not did not expect a disgusting moralist film. Anyway, as there were interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes a pretty violent guy) and that the interpretation of the two actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue to watch the movie. French cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that seems a lot to life, unlike the more stereotypical American cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd end, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the family of the executive, the cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of the girls , the guy waving from the sky like Michael Landon ... Really naughty, IMHO.
