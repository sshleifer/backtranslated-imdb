Thanks to Neil Simon's dull, dimensionless screenplay and Robert Moore's dull direction, Chapter Two becomes a showcase for Marsha Mason, who received his third of four Oscars for chapter two, giving the same performance as the one given here in Cinnderella Liberty (73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), but this time, she has no children to hang out. Chapter Two is Moore's third and final feature, having previously directed The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76) by Neil Simon. Caan is an error message, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialogue is too analytical and there is practically no decisive detail. The first half is a less than captivating adventure, which meets a cute and timid love story between a blindfolded Caan and a Mason shredder, and the sad second half makes you eager. The places in New York, as well as Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper, extremely thin, are irrelevant, but they offer at least one welcome distraction. And last but not least, there is a terrible song played during the credits.
