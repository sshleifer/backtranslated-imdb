A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel to his series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box for my birthday and I watched all the suites. The dream child was undoubtedly the worst, I was also surprised because they were doing so well with the last two suites. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with the rest. Alice just got more annoying, she's neither Nancy nor Kirsten, so she could not stand this movie. Freddy is also losing his fear, it just got a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is carrying a child, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is back as well and he's not going to clear it up since she won it so easily in the fourth movie. But anyway, he wants his child and reborn in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy also has parents? Well, that's what a nightmare on Elm Street is about: The dream kid and Alice soon discovers what Freddy's childhood was like, and maybe that's the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> Dream Child is simply a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone can be happy with this sequel. This story was really stupid, it might have worked, but again, it was executed in the wrong way. I know if you want to watch the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch them, but I would not really recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
