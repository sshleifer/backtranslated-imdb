I had the opportunity to watch this film as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my place was the ability to complete the post-screening survey. I felt that the biggest problem of the film was its lack of main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many subplots competing for time spent in front of a screen. As a result, there is not a single character that is developed enough for the audience to create any attachment. What the director and producer have failed to do is show us why we should be concerned about what happens to the characters. In fact, any sub-parcel and the associated characters could have been removed without seriously harming the film. (The time gained would have allowed the necessary development of the sub-plots and the remaining characters.) In summary, the plate of the Hungry Bachelors Club is cluttered with side dishes and appetizers when a choice is desired.
