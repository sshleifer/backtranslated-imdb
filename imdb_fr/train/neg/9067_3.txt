Although I had some hopes for this movie, especially since I like Jason Segel's game (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I must say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. have seen recent memory (Loser and Dr. T and women are also on this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some bursts of laughter, although the film could have been so much better. The premise was not that dishonest crooks who try to deceive their university studies meet their match when they are discovered by someone who offers them. The problem is that all the characters were so pretty that I did not care about any of them. The master singer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was so psychopathic that it was not so funny to watch him - he was not disturbed in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the film was difficult to follow - he kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often difficult to know which one. Only two or three of the gang's scams were actually shown, it was enough to believe that they were crooks - showing their stratagems would have resulted in a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact she was silly, badly written and badly directed. I could talk about the weaknesses of the film, but you see the idea. Not worth the rental of $ 4 or the gas it takes to drive from the movie store to rent!
