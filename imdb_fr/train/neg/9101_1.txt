This film was like "The Disney Channel after Dark". Remove the language and themes "are not we mean" and you end up with devices of dialogue and plot that insult the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "saved by the gong" as a quality television. The ridiculously clich√©d and knowingly dirty dialogue, one might think that the scenario is the product of the confinement of Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room where it is ordered to produce an amalgam of every bad scenario that each one has had. opportunity to create. If that was Roger Kumble's intention, mission accomplished.
