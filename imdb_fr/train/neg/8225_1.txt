DO NOT WATCH THIS EXCUSE SAD FOR A FILM. I lost time and money on this and I am quite surprised. <br /> <br /> The actors play is comparable to that of the high school. The script is shocking. There is no conspiracy. Twenty minutes after the end (and I think I should be rewarded for reaching my goal), I had a headache because of the cries, tears, and crying of the five girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rare for a movie nowadays) suggested rather than represent graphically, but I found the characters so irritating that I wanted to see them, and in fact every person involved in making this piece of film, dies in the most horrible way possible. <br /> <br /> I spend another ten minutes of my life saving you from a very bad hundred minutes. Do not do it.
