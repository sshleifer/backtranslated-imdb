After too many bad memories, I skipped this episode every time he appeared in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it just to remind myself why. I have always considered this to be the worst episode of ST: TNG (with the exception of "Shades of Gray", which hardly counts as an episode). <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the awkward dialogue and thought of the red pencil script written by the author's writing teacher 101: "SHOW, DO NOT SPEAK!" According to Deanna Troi's statement and the constant reminders of all the others about Okona's ravishing and dangerous thug, Guinan's explanation of how funny his droid joke is (this is not the case ), on the careful resolution of the conflict It is a point of conspiracy that is not emphasized nor triple emphasized for our edification, and there is no credible moment in it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too cuddly to be the center of plot machinations. On the other hand, it could be that none other than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") can draw from this reserved space of a role. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, I think Joe Piscopo has stopped being funny in recent years, but he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do here, although Jerry Lewis's bit was so stupidly funny.) <br /> <br /> Have a nice day, maybe think of it as a charming little homage to an episode of the original series. I would prefer to switch to "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
