From time to time, in Indian cinema, a film like Sholay changes the perception of the public by a good movie. And we are content from time to time (with a little luck) to create a Aag RGV ki that exceeds all standards and creates one. A standard so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a mixture of talent and create a dish so stale that you can feel it at a distance. Taking a classic like Sholay and the murder is totally unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called the film RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay contains many elements of folklore, the film has managed to draw on its plot by simply defining the characters so distinctly that they have survived forever. What Aag does is take those characters and mess them up so much that you'll need a contest to pick the worst. Realism is totally absent and the film ends up providing a group of "actors" parading in a plot less and less complex and seemingly unrelated. A star for this film is a ridiculous waste of votes. It is time that RGV becomes aware of the reality of its failure and evokes another plot "different" that can be classified in the cinema category.
