Before I start, I_dove_ Eddie Izzard. I think it's one of the funniest stand-ups of the moment. Maybe that means my expectations are too high, but I have not found Eddie funny in this adventure. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be himself. Everyone knows him as a comic completely out of place, and we all love him for that. But in the circle, it seems to go more for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost me in the places. Most of the topics he talked about that he has already touched on - I think I even recognized some recycled jokes. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD, you'll find a behind-the-scenes look at Eddie's tour. (interesting in places, but not very funny), and a French version of one of his shows. The buffs will like to see Eddie in another language, but the subtitled comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you already have this movie or you're going to do it. buy what I say. If you're just passing by, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With Circle, you will probably do it.
