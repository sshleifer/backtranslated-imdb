I knew this movie was not going to be great, but I thought I could give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought he had potential. Unfortunately, many of the movie's dialogues were very fake and tacky. I think Aquafresh gave money for the production of the film because they were seriously dropping hints. There is a stroke where the Aquafresh sign strikes you that you can not help but notice it. Maybe they should have focused on writing and playing more than the number of times we can drop Aquafresh products into the movie without people getting bored. The film had its moments of glory, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it at the theater.
