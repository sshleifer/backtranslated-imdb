This film is awful. The scenario is bad, the scenario is mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original movie are completely lacking. This film was shot in a dark, dark and monochromatic style (at the "War of the Worlds"), which is really disappointing after the beauty of the original movie. The character of Greg Morrisey displays a facial expression throughout the film The twists and turns of the original plot are sorely lacking here; the few that exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, who has faithfully continued in this sequel, but that's not enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance in which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be created would be if Michael Douglas agreed to join the cast.
