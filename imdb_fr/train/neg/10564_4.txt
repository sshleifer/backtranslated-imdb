The true shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad action, nor in the shallow ignoble plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series she had started, even though she had a main attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a play with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. She has that sarcasm, that spirit, that double-edged personality that's both volatile and kind. Unfortunately, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story involving an assassination. Patricia Tallman - who did not seriously return to the series until much later - luckily improved with age, like Lyta Alexander, who is little more than a mocking telepath. I'll leave you with one last thought: why does Delenn look like a frogman from outer space (even if she is a woman)? Thanks to heaven for the way the Minbari watched later in the show.
