No I'm kidding. It was horrible. <br /> <br /> Last night, I was watching my local science fiction station that airs movies every night on a monthly theme. This month is "Space turkeys, or how I learned to stop worrying and love bombs". Movies so bad, they should never have been made. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is completely horrible with two exceptions, gore makeup (which showed potential) and editing (which has slightly exceeded the rest of the film, in terms of being horrible) . The game is horrible all around, the dialogue is horrible, the script, the direction. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and archive footage of space. I will focus on the gore. Watching this movie, I thought, "What was the motivation behind the making of this film?" People like to do things, of course, but I was hesitant to think that something positive could have happened for everyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was created to increase the number of Demo Reels like Make-up Effects. He (Rick Baker) has actually started a good career. He worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), as well as several other remarkable films. Apart from that, I can not say that I have ever seen a real man melt live - incredible or otherwise - but I must say that it seemed like a fair representation of one of them. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of a bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone speaks on the phone and, in the middle of the stage, the phone jumps on his shoulder, or something similar. This film really serves to emphasize the fact that a bad editing can take many forms. More precisely, scenes that are too long and totally useless. Almost all the scenes last longer than they should have, from a pure air to this long and howling scene with Cleaver Girl. And this head cut in the river, the head is thrown into a river (slow motion), the film continues for a few minutes, then we return to the floating head and watch it fall into a waterfall. Although I'm sure they were all very proud of their cut heads, WHAT THE BELL ?? <br /> <br /> Finally, I will mention the scene of the fat lady turning / idling at the very beginning. The jerky slow motion told me that they did not idle the scene originally, but then decided that it "did not work like this", then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any case, if you see another movie in which a fat hysterical woman walks down a hallway and then through a closed glass door - all in slow motion, notice - remember the INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, because * this * is where it all started <br /> <br /> Movies like this one are best seen at home with a group of friends. This one is a little slow most of the time, but it's simply more time to create your own one-liners. This is not the worst of the worst but it is pretty terrible.
