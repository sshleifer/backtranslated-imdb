The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars into a movie is awesome. But .... too many stories, too short and really meaningless. No connection between scenes. There were 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were about 18. The frame reminded me of "All Invisible Children" - a movie I loved. Compared to that, however, "Paris I Love You" lacks the intriguing novel, which is developing, beginning and coming to an end. And it misses the subject that connects all these children. I do not think Paris is a sufficient subject to link 18 short sketches. Perhaps for people who know Paris, it's interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
