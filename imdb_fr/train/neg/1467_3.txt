No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler's revolutionary biography, who was originally the science consultant for the TV movie, dissociated himself from it. The film is historically too bad. The mistakes begin right away when Hitler's father, Alois, dies at home, when in reality he dies in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, when in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on and on. Hitler's childhood and youth are described in far too short a way, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important people at the beginning of the party, such as Hitler's father friend, Dietrich Eckart, or the party's "philosopher," Alfred Rosenberg, are totally absent. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film, he is described as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The scenario obviously follows the look that Hanfstaengl gave about himself and that he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem of the film is the representation of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly hostile, who has neither charisma nor charm and who constantly commands everyone. After watching the movie, one wonders how such a disgusting person could have followers. Since we all know what criminal evil Hitler is, all writers are naturally tempted to describe it as totally disgusting and incharismatic. But the facts are that, privately, it could be very charming and fun. His comrades were not following him because he was constantly shouting at them, but because they loved this strange man. Beyond all these historical errors, the film is well shot, the actors are first class, the shots and the design of the production give a credible impression of the time.
