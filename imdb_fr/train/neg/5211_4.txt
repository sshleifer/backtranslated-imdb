Ha. no doubt Tommy the bad guy here. I do not know why, but for some reason, little kids in horror movies tend to be like little lacrosse shots. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except the asylum of terror. but these are rare. <br /> <br /> Anyway on the movie. Can not find this movie on DVD? sure you can! All you have to do is buy the Chilling Classics DVD pack! you get not only Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! what a bargain! pff. OKAY. I finished advertising for these nerdy movies. Let's just say that this movie is not worth $ 15 alone. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical scientist. Yeah. because all the chemist's scientists are as handsome as this guy who plays Peter. He tries to find a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. the college in which he works wants to end his project, so he tries it himself. but as it is a horror movie, he sucks it off and starts an incredibly long transformation sequence that takes up about 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To complete the film, he enters into a relationship with a woman. who has a son. and she has never been married! scandalous! But of course, Tommy is one of the most irritating characters ... no. I take it back. HE is the most irritating character. Much worse than the disabled old man who wants to take Peter's job back and watches him while he's in the hospital. That's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the bad guy. <br /> <br /> We see Peter start killing random people whose vision is such that he realizes he is the one who does it and decides to do it. kill everyone on his way back to normal. However, in the end, he ends up becoming a lizard. yes, I know do not ask. The end really does not make sense. And if you hope to get a very good profit, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> It's not a HORRIBLE movie ... it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good pay. If you already have the pack of 50 movies and you're next on your list, you're not ready for a reminder, but you're not for a good movie either. Sit back, relax and eat a lot of snacks. Because this movie is not going to blow your skin anytime soon. <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis has 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.
