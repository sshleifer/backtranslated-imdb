I did not expect much from this movie, but boy, I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock does not show good behavior here, you can not feel that his character is real, I think the film would have been a little better if it was drama or romantic scenes would have been less part of the movie and more / better humor has been involved. The film is as if the filmmakers had a bad hangover. In the "making of", they do not show a single smile. It's a very bad movie! I gave three out of ten because of the few smiles it gave me, but I never laughed!
