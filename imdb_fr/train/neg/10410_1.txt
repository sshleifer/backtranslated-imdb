It is a confused and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogue and monologues. This is not an exaggeration: you must make a considerable effort to try to participate. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to explain why Erwin / Elvira would commit suicide at the end. but instead, in each scene, someone tries to explain: "when he was young, that's what happened ..." and "he just returned from Casablanca and ordered everything cut there ... ", etc. <soon in the film, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse and talks with a prostitute friend (a slaughterhouse is certainly the best place to spend pleasant discussions) and tell him the story of the life of Elvira, Fassbinder shows the massacre of one cow after another. It's hard to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course, we come to the very forced and rude symbolism of "I have suffered a lot in my life and I am about to die". <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments when something happens, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover, it is that after having made a very cheerful choreography with two other guys (as his he was looking for the necessary level of homosexuality), he recognized Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some clich√©s and interesting ideas, I must admit (as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything in the film is wasted because of the indulgence of Fassbinder.
