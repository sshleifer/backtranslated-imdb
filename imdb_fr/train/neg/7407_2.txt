1 watched 18/06/2009 ?? 2 of 10 (Dir- Pete Riski): Weird psychotic film about an autistic girl tested in the hospital, the power wobbles, then hell breaks loose. Honestly, I'm not sure of the intentions of the filmmakers on this. What we have for the next hour and a half (at least, it was not longer) was a horror / twilight / zombiefest / twisted ghost movie that really made no sense, even in the end. Initially, after the power outage, everyone misses the hospital, except for a small group of misfits, including the daughter and her father. There's the typical boring character, a scary old man, and the typical tough guy like a lot of scares to terror and, of course, to the girl to whom the main character is attracted. Random things start happening at different times, such as the appearance of ghosts and monsters, an indication that time has stopped and people are dying as this small group tries to escape its occupation. really hate the way they used the affliction of this girl and hinted that she was the cause and placing him in a hospital where care is provided is really lame. We never really found the answer to what was happening, which is very strange, so avoid this dog. Unless you want to be confused and confused for an hour and a half, it's not for you or for moviegoers. What a waste of time ?? really !!
