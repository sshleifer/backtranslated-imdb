It would have been a * big * silent movie. The acting is really good, at least in a Look Ma, I really do a lot playing! sort of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. Each line is PROFOUND! Every scene is turned upside down by human tragedy! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I wanted to gag. Yet, like any train wreck, I could not tear my eyes. This dialogue may have worked on the stage, even if I doubt it. On screen, it was cluttered, randomly, as usual, and just about every stereotypical negative adjective you could imagine to describe a very bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in huge and huge doses, you * could * enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, though. Despite all this melodrama, this thing is moving at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script must have been very different when the actors involved read it. It just does not work once they are able to present it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The IMDB does us a disservice, sometimes, using its clumsy computer-controlled "weighted score". The curse of the hungry class deserves less than a 1. <br /> <br /> Character-centered fiction is excellent, but when you develop your characters simply by pushing them into hoops without any plausible explanation of their maturation or their evolution, character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * a character development. It's a plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least look at it muted. Maybe all the characters will wave their arms with amusement. <br /> <br /> Oh, and word to the wise - to prove it's really an art film, you see James Woods in all his "man looked, I'm-figuration-and-representation- literal vulnerability of the naked man "glory. <br /> <br /> Do not say you have not been warned.
