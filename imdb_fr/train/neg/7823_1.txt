This movie was extremely poorly designed from all angles, except technological. I got up and looked at everyone coming out of the theater, their faces emptying as if their lives were shining in front of their eyes - eyes wandering towards their neighbor, wondering if it was just them. I mean, how could the movie really be bad. Nobody will admit it, it is a classic case of the emperor does not wear clothes. "Who am I to interrogate a movie containing a guy who stops an airliner?" But the fact remains, every member of the audience is thinking about what I'm writing right now. In fact, I plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lois is only excited by the power, she will not even have a cup of coffee with the spectacled Superman who does not stop the jet-liner. It can not be the look in "his" eyes deep in his soul or anything of the kind. In the old Supermans, she had some level of connection with him, he was not the number one priority, of course, but it reinforced her character that she was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Law before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite makes Superman what to eat at McDonalds is average. nobody. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his father from the Earth, then finds his real grandfather, the story is captivating every step of the way. He is human, he has relationships with people and he feels love for people, he has relationships with high school students, he has relationships with people who feel different. He tells. Superman Returns Superman Returns seems to concern only the super-people and it seems that he "does a job" when he saves people. There is something that Clark likes in Clark's style: she is really in love with him inside but can admit it, and when he comes in as a Superman, it throws a veil on love on the spot. Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark (at least that's what the movie says, whether it's the intent or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a bunch of dummies for Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just watch it again. When I was a child, I "thought" that I appreciated the action, but now, I know that HISTORY was holding me back too, watching it again and again. If I saw Superman coming back as a child, I would have hated him too, I think. <br /> <br /> There is so much heart and soul and super power in this movie, it is sick. Superman abandons his powers for love while a global plot continues and in the meantime, meanwhile, Lex Luther has something fantastic in his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE Now, there's a love affair between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and Clark's inner nature beats Superman's power, because when his nature SUPERmorale disappears and he is SuperHUMAN (who does human things with his super powers), she sees that it is not the power of Superman of which she is in love, it is not the case. SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman whom she loves - and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark that she "prefers" him to Superman, he is delighted, he has again established a human connection. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO LACK SUPERMAN RETURN. <br /> <br /> Clark super-sneezes to help the child to have a strike - humanity again. Moreover, it is an INERESTING use of super powers. He does not use only brute force. <br /> <br /> He crushes the charcoal diamond for his wife because she has to sell his, love is the only thing that pushes him to use his powers other than to save. <br /> <br /> It seems that nothing is at stake in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the nemesis's conspiracy of world domination .. we see the suffering, we see how it affects Pryor and the others and the people in the middle of it .. there no damage, in particular. emotional plot of Lex to sink the United States. We see a crystal globe thrown into space. Superman had to be very creative in the first three Supermans to put an end to the plot against him, he could not simply "access" his superpowers. In the first, he had to stop two missiles that went in different directions, then break with his universal mandate and erase the story to save the life of Lois ... (it was thirty years ago!) In the second, he had to surpass three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than, but combined with Lex's genius and the immoral tactics of the wicked, Superman's mastery was not enough, he had to work against each other and surpass him. .. In Superman III, again, his superpowers were not enough to win .. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything he saw. He could not use a direct attack on a computer because he calculated it in advance, so he had to use a harmless acid Become fatal to the computer after it reacted to the attack, he discovered this acid earlier when he could not simply use his superpowers to blow a fire because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his super-abilities - he could not wear from the water, so he froze a lake and dropped it On fire .. Now, in Superman Returns, he simply plunges the island into an outdoor space, like a night storm for UPS. He does not need to understand anything, he just uses his "super strength". And Lex Luther showed his talent at the level of the premeditation of a junkie who just missed junk. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw this island into an isolated space after being stabbed with a kyrptonite KNIFE right into the bloodstream AND the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores onto his face, but he turned away from his eyes and nose as if it was not Gray Poupon he was looking at.
