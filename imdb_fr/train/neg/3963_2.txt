How many times do we have to see a ghost scroll in the background and reach the top of a mirror? This has been done in two dozen recent memory films and four dozen times in this jerky and badly done movie. There were only two odd moments to enjoy ... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the Diet Coke in the 64 oz. cup I pulled it out of. Lateral characters could have been drawn from various cartoons of Scooby Doo. There was the nice old sheriff. There was the bizarre weird living in the backcountry with the Alabama sled. Many characters without development. The most disturbing image was that of a child murdered at first. But rather than exploring the murder of the child, which would have been interesting, they simply let us know that she was dead and that her parents had trouble reconciling her death with the community and with each other. When they reach the booth, the scenes rarely take place together ... with flashing images of the dead girl interjected here and there. Oh ... and the strange sounds were also exaggerated. You know what I mean ... cracking doors that open on their own, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. I did not see that before. Once again, you will see the incredible door open in the film again and again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: A scary scene is scary only if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before yelling "it's a wrap!"
