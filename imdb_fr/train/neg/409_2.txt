<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, the wandering looks of women and many heated conversations between characters and pans. <br /> <br /> It's for nothing. Because there is no action at all in this movie. He fakes all his pieces. All actors give the kind of performances form a Verhoeven film. In other words, we strive to act at almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because the characters were in such a macho world. In this, scientists act in the same way. Sorry, Paul, but the soldiers and the scientists are not really of the same state of mind. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of the plot is that after escaping for that night to do evil, the character of Kevin Bacons returns to science. laboratory where we have already spent more time watching these animated mannitens (except Elizabeth Shue) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they follow him if he could be anywhere ??? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. Then take a look at what this movie is doing and see how much the project has been done and designed. <br /> <br /> The Doco on the DVD is even more insulting, because everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of AD Genius. Every second movie is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This film is not remarkable. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
