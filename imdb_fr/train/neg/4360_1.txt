First, let me tell you that I thought a lot about writing a commentary for this movie. The best criticism for this kind of cinema may be just silence. Film addressed to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to appear "authentic" and the characters must be supposed "real people". An Italian could never think that the characters could be "real": they are only "discrete" stereotypes. This gives a very confused view of what life is like in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (intrigue? What plot?) And humor does not laugh anyone over 12 years.
