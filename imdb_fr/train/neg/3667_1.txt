The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "immune" against "the tainted man". Too bad, that does not explain anything else: how did he get what he "caught" / what was / why does it work so fast? Then we go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the first game past or future? It turns out to be a thing of the past, of course, but for a minute, it seems equally likely that the film will be moved at the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention, huh? Or maybe it's just badly done. Then there was a lot of confusion about the different jobs he did in related fields, and finally a mention of how he should have died from the original experience he did. Aha! So, the private sector and the private sector came together to poison one of their best men to see the effects? He must have been one of the best guys, he is friends with the director of the chemical society, for the sake of God. Then there is the substance itself: Technically, a poison, but it turns into immune "carriers", so we can have everything we want. a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, very different things in real life. Like magic, it's not contagious from one dying victim to another, but only from the carrier. As is practical. Then there is the basic protocol: they embark on a situation without having any idea of ​​what is preparing or preparing. Did not the producers have enough money to wash after the crew left the scene of an unknown deadly substance? I kept thinking that Hurt was going to die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would prove to be the closest after all.
