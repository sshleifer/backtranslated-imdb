THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Code Il Gatto a Nove) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> < br /> (35mm and 70mm prints) <br /> <br /> A former blind journalist (Karl Malden) hears a blackmail plot in front of a genetic research laboratory and then associates himself with a colleague reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders in the laboratory, involuntarily putting their loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic murderer. <br /> <br /> Entered production following the unexpected global success of his directorial debut, The Bird with Plumage Crystal (1969), Dario Argento designed THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo thriller in the same vein as his predecessor, highlighting the famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh out of his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and the rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which commercials claim to be "nine times more suspensive" than "Bird" - is a disappointing, immaculately photographed and elegantly executed sequel, but too cumbersome and purposeless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are eminently observable in friendly roles, and the director of photography, Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE), uses the wide Cromoscope frame to evoke the world of high technology in which the dark scenario of Argento unfolds, but the secondary plot of the European star Catherine Spaak (LA LIBERTINE) as a romantic interest of Franciscus represents only useless padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-glove assassin at a crowded train station (edited with elegant assurance by the cult film star Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus look for an important clue in a grave in decomposition and fall prey to the sneaky machinations of the killer. But despite these bursts of brilliance, the film goes aimlessly from one scene to another, simmering slowly without ever really boiling. No wonder "Cat" failed to emulate the resounding success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
