Actress Patty Duke has written an insightful, funny and rude book about her acting career, her crazy couch sex life, her depressive manic episodes, and her suicide attempts that almost drove her back for good. With this rich material to draw (and Patty playing herself in the final act), one would think that an awesome television director like Gilbert Cates could put everything together in a movie, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow from Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the fragmentary story (jump in time) does not absorb, we are never allowed to steer with what is happening, and production seems to be hampered by a low budget. The actors are poorly informed, and the fact that Duke herself is finally appearing has no value - the film's false reality is so thick now that Patty can not bring stability to the screenplay. It seems that the producers were sincere enough (and conscious) to steer the film with anxiety towards Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom, but left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
