I thought this movie seemed like a case study on how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I am a filmmaker, I give him a 2 for more consistency. <br /> <br /> The problems persist from beginning to end, the plot being extremely predictable, it uses snippets of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. . The computer-generated graphics looked too much like viewing a point video game and the director did not seem to want to try to add realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he had to work with, but I did not find that information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project was pushing the boundaries of a low-budget film too much, resulting in a production that takes the viewer with the story without his imagination. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
