I do not like this movie very much. If you've read Puzo's books, or at least watched the first two movies (especially the first one), you'll agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga presented after Puzo's novel, the scenario of this film is sometimes even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story comes to nothing, even if it seems to go in the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that the Corleone saga in the 90s is expected at different times. find things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy certain dialogues from other movies, in contexts where they did not fit. Why this? It looks like these poorly done suites that are simply trying to copy the qualities of the original movie. <br /> <br /> What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have united to do that. A man who has directed plays like Apocalypse Now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the cinema until his death. Al Pacino too, to be the actor he is. But Mario Puzo should not have written that. How to come? He damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90s story about the crowd, and it's great. We can never say the same about the plot of the godfather III.
