Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just the release of the DVD that had huge gaps of thirty seconds between scenes? It's good, I went back to sleep watching the first time. Then I fell asleep a second time and a third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I've seen either ... but it's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say it's the worst I've ever seen in my life! Do not try to be mean, but Unhinged could have used more production. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate horror movies, or even that I do not like this movie. I just felt that I laughed a lot more about the movie than laughing with him. The horrible moments were not too badly done, but could have been better done even with a minimal budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, the end of the twists was rather bad and the exhibition took forever. without exposing much. <br /> <br /> I recommend you avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
