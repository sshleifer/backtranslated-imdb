Plot: a couple in love decides to embark on extra-marital journeys in a flashy car. They find themselves stuck (literally) in a compromising position, while the car roams aimlessly around the countryside until the unfortunate couple is saved by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's all. It's the whole movie. There may have been a dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to my mind. It should be obvious now that this movie is not only useless, but physically painful to watch. The fact that it has been interpreted by two of the best emerging actors in the UK (one of which has unfortunately died today) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson has been outstanding in the well deserved Oscar winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Let us remember him for this role and try to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination never happened.
