Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... everything ... all. . . Ok, it'll be ok ... I know it'll be ok in a month or two. I hope soon to be able to get rid of flash backs. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I just can not have the guts to try to keep something to eat for now. Wrong? Yes bad Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, bad does not seem to get the message out the right way. Hmm ... There's no word to describe how awful ... not horrible ... Hmm, horribly cast / played / filmed / directed / written. Now, I do not know what to do, but throw it away. Perhaps you are burning, I would not want it to be found in the depths of an architectural excavation in a thousand years. The worst film since "Hey Happy"
