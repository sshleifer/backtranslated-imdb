this movie is terrible. The characters are completely incredible and extremely incoherent. The plot is horrible and some scenes in the class are worth seeing and make viewing uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and the characteristics would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the total lack of credibility of the school environment would suggest that the writers probably never went to high school . In most cases, the acting was also weak, although most of the time was due to a poor script and scenario, I'm not sure that actors were able to make this movie visible. <br /> <br /> that said, the sound The track was correct and the cinematography was nice in places (even if the editing was poor).
