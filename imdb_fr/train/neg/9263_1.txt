What was the problem with the clothes? They were all dressed as in the late 70s and early 80s. The cars were even outdated. The school was obsolete. The nuns' clothing was obsolete and the hospital looked like something from the 40s, with its parishes, wooden stairs and other objects. Nothing in the whole movie meant that it happened in 1991. My mother was laughing and saying, "Geeeee-od, WHEN was this movie made?" When we pressed the "INFO" button on our remote, we were sure that 1991 should be a typo! Has anyone else noticed that? What I preferred was when the woman spoke on the phone of the cross upside down in the mirror, on the phone, her well-bred husband, and he just replied: you about that later. "This line was just classic, just like a man!" My mother's favorite part was when they gave Rottweiler his own "devil's child." My mother said, "All that the child of the heck ... a Rottweiler. "She also enjoyed the collapse of all the people in the churches, their tight chests.His OTHER favorite element was the guy from the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, driving right in the garbage truck / dump truck / front loader.He had about 20 seconds left to stop the car ... but he kept moving forward, with a really stupid and empty look on his face.I mean, at what speed can you go to a school parking?!?! It does not matter!
