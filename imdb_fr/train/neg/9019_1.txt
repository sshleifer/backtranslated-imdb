Why else would it do that to me? <br /> <br /> It's not that I expect Dean Cain to produce blockbuster movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I know how ... the "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is going to be a cheese movie, and every movie has its own way of doing you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers because you can not ruin this movie more than it already is. <br /> <br /> For starters ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How come a scientist is from Chicago and another scientist is from Los Angeles and none of them can be more Eastern European 'he was trying? How difficult would it have been to find an American actor or simply change the lame state sheet provided by the film to indicate that these people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why are there two occasions when the film gives us a slug line? We get a heliport day, then a messy day later. And that's it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared even when they talked about it, but I guess that's beside the question. <br /> <br /> Does a movie really improve if you are able to watch it on several shared screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can certainly walk in this room ... more and more ... and more and more ... and more ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in the history of cinema? It was straight out of scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... you want dinner? Of course, but not in a Chinese place .... with Dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA !! HAHAHA! I was Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> go to black <br /> <br /> my god, it made me cringe, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But do not be afraid ... even if the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive ... for whatever reason, there is a second lab without staff and inhabited that has survived well, allowing him to make a sequel. Hooray for us all. <br /> <br />
