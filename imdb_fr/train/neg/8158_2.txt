What's the point of creating suites that have absolutely no relevance to the original movie? No point. That's why the Prom Night suites are so embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The original film involved a group of children who hid a dark secret that ended up killing all but one, in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone please explain to me what a queen who died at the end of year ball coming out of the tomb to stun the crown has to do with the first movie then? Prom Night 2 had holes in the plot that left the public constantly wondering how it had happened and why should it happen? But in the end, I guess you could call it one of those movies so bad that you end up laughing at it.
