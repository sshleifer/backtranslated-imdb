Yes, I'm just going to tell you about this one so do not read if you want surprises. I got this one with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD entitled Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this one was not so good. It started interesting enough by looking at the villain (if you can call it that) by looking at the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and kind, but after a while, you look for action and this film gives nothing. You need to develop your character, but it goes too far and you still do not know why the guy breaks. About an hour later, he kills three out of four people while a crowd is terrorized, and the guys he kills are not even his targets, they make fun of him. This is one of the killer's many unsuccessful attempts to hit the bad guy. He then tries to kill this other man and tries to break into his home by slipping into the fireplace. He gets stuck quickly and can barely get out. He then enters the basement and then tries to kill him by choking him in his room. He can not kill the guy this way, so he catches a star from the tree and cuts his throat. What the hell was a tree doing even in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yes, the killer before this killing stopped at a party and had fun too. That's about all but the people of the city who are chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that air he wants to play. What was it? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How does it end, well since I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He gets off the road in his van and proceeds as follows: well, let's say it was bad !!!!!!!!!!!!
