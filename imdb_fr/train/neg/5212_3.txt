Without knowing it, I had this film on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek collection and one night I decided to watch it. but do not expect much. At the beginning of the credits, I am surprised to discover that this film was made under the company Filmirage. Filmirage brought to the world narcotics such as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", which forced me to watch it. <br /> <br /> potential to be decent enough, even if it was without originality. The gore scenes could have been improved if they were prolonged and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the pace started to slow down and I found myself thinking, "Well, it's better for someone to be killed quickly," or "Someone to better mutate." At the beginning of this trail, when I thought, although someone was killed or mutated, however, as indicated, the gore and effects were not very good. What has aggravated things is the confusion of transitional scenes; Example: Dr. Houseman would first be at the zoo, then he would have a flashback on the possibility of killing someone, finally he would wake up in cold sweat in his bed-- asking the audience to ask "was- he dreamed he was at the zoo? " Like the rhythm of the film, these transitions of scenes deteriorated gradually. <br /> <br /> I could say that the development of Dr. Houseman's character was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once I saw what the doctor has metamorphosed. I hope you will laugh - which is really the only reason to see this movie at least once; this film turns involuntarily like a joke all the time. <br /> <br /> The costume of the um, what becomes Dr. Houseman can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "The Quest for the Powerful Sword", which was created in the same year. You must love Filmirage movies, they always use the same things!
