Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was ok but the show seems more real. it just looked like a longer episode of AnimalPlanet with more funny lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for real you know it hurts. and can not they jump high? all catch by the tail. There were two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. When Terry finds this baby joey, she says, "We have to feed them like a baby." Woah! I thought she was going to get up and nurse this kid. that would have made PG-13. While I was on Terry, did anyone notice in the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge about ritual mating? she knows her sex. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want a koala, a dingo and Joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog, Sui, actually has a reason to be in this movie. even if a little one proves useless against the hottie wielding dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else looks at it, try and agree with me to say that the fat stuffed country lady with the flock of dogs was RIGHT shotgunning the fang. he ate his sheep !! I would be crazy too!
