I love Jane Austin's novels. I love the books and movies Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and I'm halfway to Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I left the book after 2 chapters and at the end of the film, I made fun of Emma. She did not seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows (which is excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. Dunno. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dance was awkward compared to Pride and Prejudice by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 because Knightly really beautiful, and although it's a rather uneven performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing.
