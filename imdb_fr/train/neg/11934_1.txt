I watched almost one episode of this series and could not take it anymore. It was as if I had already watched dozens of episodes, then it hit me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard this joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone falling like that on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same scenario, etc. None of the actors are interesting here either! Some have been good at other shows (not here), and others are new to a job they never should have. Avoid that stinky!
