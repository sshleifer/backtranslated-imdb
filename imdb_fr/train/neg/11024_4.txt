I first saw this film in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply mounted by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in a complete form. So what? The plot is incredibly misguided - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of strong, straight and basically stern feminist ladies. Men are now trying to fight it, then a series of extremely stupid clich√©s - a sexual urge, a constant male desire for sex, feminists who present themselves as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not) etc. The very performance of star Jerzy Stuhr is here in wood and strangely bad - he just makes funny faces and repeats saying "I'm in the elevator with a naked girl and I did not do anything to her!" It was supposed to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a tasteless joke, full of predictable jokes and insinuations under the waist. Do not waste your time on it, it's bad.
