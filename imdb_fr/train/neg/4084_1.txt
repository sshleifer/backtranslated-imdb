From time to time, you hear radio DJs inviting listeners to name movies that the listener can not endure or have watched from beginning to end. This is the movie I think ... a few days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a Shakespeare play. Not sure, but I think I shot in this movie some 20 minutes later ... I think I realized that my nails would not tear themselves and that they looked at me implorably to make me cut. <br /> <br /> This film seemed boring and pretentious. <br /> <br /> Even if it's the first movie I've rated so low (which I tried to watch), I would not have wanted I want you to forget the other films of Peter Greenaway, his English director. I remember thinking that his movie "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and His Lover" was a very good British movie, even though its content was sometimes overwhelming - a brilliant film, but I can understand why people are hesitant about it. see. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from Greenaway was "A zed and two Noughts". Again, it contained content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but still intrigued. <br /> <br /> The other film I usually think about too late for such radio shows is "Brazil". Have never managed to look at it since the beginning, without falling asleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you like movies that are important, highly stylized, laboriously punctuated, and difficult to follow, head straight for Prosero's books.
