If you can go through the "classic Meyer" titles / intro, you can browse anything. But would you like? I did not find many things to dig my teeth. I guess if you go with low expectations, you'll be delighted (at Charlie's Angels.) But for my money, I would like a little something more, visual, more moving. More. I have the impression of begging for porridge at the foot of the master. men have the goods. but he just does not want to share.
