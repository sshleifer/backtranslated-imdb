This movie is quite amusing because of Virginia Madsen's excellent performance and the fact that Lindsey Haun is charming. However, the reason the movie is so predictable is that we have seen everything before. I have not read A Mother's Gift, but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears it's completely different from this movie. Unless you consider ending a film with what is essentially a music video as an original idea, the film as a whole evokes the word plagiarized.
