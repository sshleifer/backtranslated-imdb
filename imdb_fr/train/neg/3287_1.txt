If this film were to be renamed, it should be "Les Jackasses de Hazzard". To sum up, this film is nothing more than 88 minutes of two immature country punks that wander around the city and countryside in the city, in the countryside, chasing girls and respecting the law. <br /> <br /> fan of "Dukes" and what tarnishes the film is that the characters are down. The abuse of profanation, sexual references and drug use has made the reputation of "Dukes" a beast of substance. <br /> <br /> Apart from this comparison with the TV show, the acting was horrible. The only actor to have succeeded is the famous 1969 Dodge Charger, named General Lee. Others exaggerated the role of the character who tarnished the film. <br /> <br /> The "Dukes" were another victim of the tragedy of the transition from television and the big screen of the 21st century to Hollywood. Skip this movie and buy the TV show on DVD. <br /> <br /> My note: F
