This film may have low production values, but it's also what makes it so good. The special effects are disgusting and well done. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy, played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as leader of the gang is hilarious, just like the other members. This film actually tries to make a point by saying that the nuclear waste factories are bad. 4/10 Just comedy, disgusting movie.
