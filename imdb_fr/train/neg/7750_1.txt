This film was the worst film on the planet, I like more BARNEY than this film. The graphics are nil, half of the film is animated, the dead are zero, and I was ready to pursue the authors of the film! PLEASE DO NOT WIN VIDEO HOURS. The only good thing was when the movie ******* ended! This film is composed of 50% Jurassic Park, 0.1% Sabretooth and 49.9% DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it.You want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cover was nil, the graphics were nil, the blood looked (I mean, it's) ketchup, people were trying to blow themselves up, the students thought about it and could stand up. I mean, there was a 5-foot tiger running straight to a woman, throwing a spear 100 feet away! Wait until you can actually hit it! The game was horrible too. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and it had to destroy it.
