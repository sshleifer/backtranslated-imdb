First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a qualified actor, barely decent, sometimes just ugly. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole has sunk. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the plot. A Vietnam veterinarian named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as resistant as a leather thong, and still others, what one can believe when he drives a palace of nails between the feet of two guys and the pins on the ground), gets the word that his family was killed and his sister removed. As a result, he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had a little potential, but still thin enough to start. <br /> <br /> Now, the acting game. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that he was one of the worst actors in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. Fools playing Clampets / Deliverance rejections must be tied up and filmed for their so-called insulting performances for actors around the world, especially the talented ones who have never had their big luck! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. The fight is going on pretty much at BEST, and the fight in hand is deplorable. I saw more real fights at the Renaissance Festival (and these were rather fake)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ANY COST! IF THIS WAS THE ONLY FILM IN EXISTENCE, YOU WANT TO STILL ENJOY IT! On behalf of your brain cell count, do NOT monitor this thing!
