What made the idea of ​​seeing this film so appealing is the hope that it will live up to the brilliant classic story of Charlotte Bronte. I was deeply disappointed that this film, which seemed to be hastily written or filmed, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the spirit between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be missing from the screenplay or left out in the editing room. Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which allowed her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph, was also omitted. Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane was fleeing Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame of begging for bread, the threat of dying from the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing and for those who have not read the book, I can not imagine that this story would be the least interesting. The script and the realization did not contribute much to classical history.
