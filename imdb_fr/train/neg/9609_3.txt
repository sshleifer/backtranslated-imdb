I started watching this movie hoping for a horror film barely tolerable for Hammer ... and I was not far away. There is a good amount of gore glimpsed and they threw a lot of nudity, but the last half of the movie has some ironic twists. Holy cow, they actually thought a little about history and did not completely fall into the predictable scenario that was originally expected. And if I dare say it, part of the "free" nudity was not, after all, because it fit perfectly with the story and the setting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's all in all a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a smarter shade than REALLY horrible guts like Mesa's Lost Women and Monster Robot.
