We saw this on the set of the local video store, saw "Coppola" in the credits and were thrilled. It was the one and only time this film was attracting interest. I could never really understand if it was a humorous film attempt that failed miserably, or a serious movie attempt that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish. The sound in particular was absolutely appalling, especially in the scenes shot in the small bar; the dialogue was so cheesy that it was amazing. Very disappointing.
