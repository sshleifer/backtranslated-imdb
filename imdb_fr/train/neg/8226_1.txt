Since many horror movies are based on the fact that one or more of the central characters are doing something stupid at some point in the process, the girls in this movie would win gold, silver and bronze at an Olympic ceremony at the Darwin Awards. A mentally handicapped baboon would have made better choices than he had done and would have shouted much less by doing so. <br /> <br /> If you like films with a grainy image, deliberately camera amateur (my 92 year old grandmother uses a camcorder with better results), an extremely poor sound and no discernable storyline / storytelling , so this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should appreciate the following: women who shout for no reason, women who moan for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "We must find Stephanie" "Yeah I can not believe I was talking to her, like last night" "She called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about a date when she was asked" "WHAT, how is it that she did not tell me"? As we go along, our friend is pursued by a serial killer with a shotgun and a host of gruesome weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me that she was was making a date. <br /> <br /> Well, the budget is low. This does not mean that you have to give the impression that it costs half the budget. The "score" is interesting since all the writers / directors of the film itself have written and interpreted - with the exception of one title -. In fact, it seems that the entire budget was spent when sampling a piece of The Duskfall, a Swedish death metal band. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing end of all the film is the end that remains. we with the possibility of a suite.
