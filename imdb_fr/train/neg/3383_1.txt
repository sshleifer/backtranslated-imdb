The first time I saw the musical at the Denver Performing Arts Center, it was absolutely breathtaking, breathtaking and its continuity in intrigue and dialogue was so fantastic that I loved it a lot more than most musicals that I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you NEVER have to see Zach's face. He was still in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the entire production. When I heard that they were making a film, I was looking forward to it, but when I watched the movie version, I was so disappointed that I was disappointed to feel cheated. The film lacks captivating humor in live production and it never lets you be in close contact with all the characters. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if it were ever to be relaunched, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you do all you can to see it. This will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
