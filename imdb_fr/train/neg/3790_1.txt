I do not really post comments, but I wanted to make sure to warn people about this movie. It's an unfinished student movie with no functionality. From a technical point of view, it's totally amateur - constant unintentional jumps in scenes, dubbed dubbing, and so on. I do not want to be too hard: I did my share of student films, and they were all awful, but there is no reason for this film to be in the world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> Presumption sure - like the cast - positive feedback from filmmakers, friends and family.
