Note: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series approached and we knew it well for six months, while Sci-Fi Channel continued to sprinkle its BG commercials, I admit I felt worse as I learned more. <br /> <br /> As with any cinematographic work of art that has stood the test of time, different people go there to see different things. In this respect, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, it's the chrome warriors with the red light oscillating in their visor. For others, it is the penchant that they kept for special effects quite evolutive for their time. Many forget the state of special effects in the late 70s, especially those of television. For some, memories disappear around the story. Others still remember the relationships that the relationships themselves had put in place to help them overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I come from this last group. The nucleus of Battlestar Galactica was the people who came together to save each other from a diabolical empire. Yes, the bad. The Cylons had to gain only the extermination of the human race and yet they did. As the base stars swirled around, men and women gathered to confront an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they cared about each other and they trusted each other to get to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws and was sometimes winding, but these were people who might interest you. <BR /> <br /> The authors of this current interpretation seemed to never understand this. In a way, he took the least significant part of the original series, the names of the character and an interpretation of the story, to create what they called nothing less than a reinvention of science fiction television. Since this was their goal, they can be judged on how they accomplished it: a failure. It was far from being a reinvention. In fact, it was in many ways one of the longest-running science-fiction attempts of any kind. He borrows generously from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even from Battlefield Earth. I find that unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been contributing to popular science fiction for over a decade and has contributed to the most popular science-fiction television you can hope to see. . One of the difficulties he seems to have had is that there could be no conflict within the Enterprise D & E bridge crew. It was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry's ST: TNG. Like many who have lived by the rules of others who seize every opportunity to break them when they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he had learned under the famous master of science- fiction: Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best possible story, he created a dysfunctional cast as I've never seen it with the intention of creating as many casting conflicts as possible. In addition to being dysfunctional, some of them were not at all credible. Anyone who has ever been part of the army knows that someone who strikes a superior officer without reason would not be trapped for a few days, he could have been executed and would never have left the next day. That would not have happened, especially in times of war. <br /> <br /> The thing I remembered most about Ron Moore's previous work was that he was the one who wrote the death of Captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk and, alas for me, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
