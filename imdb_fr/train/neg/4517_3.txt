There is much to enjoy here: spectacular places and flight sequences; costumes, accessories and period decorations; and competent writing and acting. However, to appreciate a drama, we need at least one principal who has certain qualities that we can love or admire. In this group of catty snobs, we only found one very nice character ?? an unlucky man has engaged in an ephemeral peripheral role as a helpless victim. From the feedback we received, it is clear that we are completely out of sync, but we have not found their malevolent schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining. Even the dog is hateful. We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes. So you have to consider these observations, but what I could find about this mini-series did not allow us to hope for a transformation or a redemption of the characters.
