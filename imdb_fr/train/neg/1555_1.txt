When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, featuring these twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be so serious, as the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has the reputation of creating sordid movies, but well shot. THE BARBARIANS is a remarkably trash action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARE and fails on all levels. The look of the movie is all wrong. Some scenes have been well-filmed, but the schintzy and discarding "disco" tone and look of clothes and hair that people adorn makes no sense, even for a low-budget film like this. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with this ridiculous hairstyle and costume. He is supposed to be threatening, but he presents himself as a jester. And it's fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first film, walking in a skinny bikini. I'm sure she wants this shipwreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbaric twins are acceptable as muscular heroes, but it's almost impossible to build a proper critique of their game because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really badly designed. The film only tries to differentiate a twin from the other by asking one of them to wear a loincloth that covers his ass, while the loincloth of the other twin barely covers his muscular ass. I am not joking! Do not ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to accept this film. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this trashy movie. It's just bad.
