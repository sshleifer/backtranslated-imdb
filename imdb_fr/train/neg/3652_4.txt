I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed by the lack of a menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my original reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. Although amusing to watch, I feel that she has not lived up to the expectations I found in her other films. In fact, I was also happy to see Arkin perform a humorous performance. The other two actors that I did not know very well, so I can not compare their performance, but they were also quite nice. The acting is the only endearing quality of this film in my opinion. The scenario, though some might say slightly convincing, lacked direction. I think the main problem comes from the script and not the direction of this film. If you like one of these actors, I recommend this movie, but otherwise, leave it alone.
