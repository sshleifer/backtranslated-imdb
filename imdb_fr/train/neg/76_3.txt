I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne <br /> <br /> It's superficial, two-dimensional, unattractive and, hard to believe given the subject, boring. The actors are passable, but they did not have much to work given the very painful and unimpressive scenario. For those who feared that Ned Kelly is too intellectualized, rest assured, this narration is totally devoid of literary depth, told entirely on the surface and filled with essential casting standards. However, it does not work either as a popcorn movie. His rhythm is too quirky and his art is too lacking to satisfy even the level of a common actor. <br /> <br /> I doubt very much that Gregor Jordan can sit down and say to himself "this is the best I could have done with the material". <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, as is the national response to him. Perhaps a folk genius, perhaps a class warrior, perhaps a psychopath and probably all of these things, he has dominated Australian mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> That's the life.
