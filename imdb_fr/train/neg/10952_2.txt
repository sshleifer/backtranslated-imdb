I hate the fact that this film has absolutely no creative contribution. I know they are realistic, but to be honest, I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle low production values, but I'm a slacker for low production values, but at least I work with good ideas. The direction is only going to catch a camcorder and walk around a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig that because it makes things a lot more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that the drama was essentially life with dull, dull parties. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not far. We get to see Rosetta walking somewhere, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying sacks of flour, Rosetta returning home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... it's just not fun. There is not really any deeper meaning either. I was so bored that I started looking for reflections on life in this film, but it's simply realism, the most overrated quality of the industry. I guess I'm supposed to like that, but come on, there's nothing in it.
