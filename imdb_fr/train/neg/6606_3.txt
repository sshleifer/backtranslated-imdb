Please, do not hate me but I must be honest, watching this movie, I had fun, <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a cast and some stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Useless songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Holi .... well ... it was OK! Because of the tradition, each movie has one !! Chad Raha hai Nasha No matter ... A stupid and VERY NECESSARY song jee Le ... It sounded like a Playboy song A stupid song ... <br /> <br /> Other than songs. The movie was OK It was Ram Gopal Verma's own adaptation ... If you think so, you'll like this film <br /> <br /> Well, this movie depends only on whoever is watching it and its judgment. the film is total Copy He / She would like to smash her head in the cinema OR IF he / she thinks of the director, he / she would be relaxed and take a look at this film <br /> < I looked at both ways that I would like to congratulate and abuse Ram Gopal for this disaster that he caused ... <br /> <br /> Well Other things that hindered the fact that the CAST was unbelievably bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own film Remake Funny, what did the director think) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veer (Bobby Deol could have been better) Appearance in Mehbooba's song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right, Tabu was right for that role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think ha Deol would have been awesome) Mohanlal Like Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute ... Oops sorry hehehehe, it was OK I could not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The movie would have even FAIRED a Small if the cast was OK <br /> <br /> I was not even exciting, but just to watch <br /> <br /> The overall score <br /> <br /> Scene shot ... I gave him a little credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Scenario ... 3/10 Wrong script songs ... 5/10 Useless in the film, could have been better, Sweet for the ears Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi, a Pakistani, will play an important role in the success of his video game on PC and on iPods and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br />
