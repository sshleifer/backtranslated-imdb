After seeing the movie trailer and discovering that Spike Lee was performing, I was excited to learn about this event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I was expecting more of a history lesson than anything else. What I got is an interesting acting game, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of movie that really have something to do with Sam's Son. I guess the movie was not about Sam's Son, but it was a glance at the summer of 1977. Label me disappointed. <br /> <br />
