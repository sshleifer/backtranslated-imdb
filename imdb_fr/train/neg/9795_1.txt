Come on, what's wrong with this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always thought that the show, which had been imported from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan and became one of the most ridiculous and futile excuses in the history of toy merchandising! This show has absolutely no sense with this show. <br /> <br /> Bad haircuts, bad suits, earrings, etc., show all that was ridiculous in the 90s. From two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to "duhs" , from the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: MAKE ME A BREAK! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan, then from Disney He bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now, the public must have rebroadcasts of this show on the Disney channel, for example. <br /> <br /> All I can say once again is give me a break!
