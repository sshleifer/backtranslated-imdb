This early entry into the Patriotic category has slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the commercials and posters, but you have to wait for a while before you catch a glimpse of it, in a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we had established George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but have to come together in the face of an attack. I saw Sanders as so many nice players that it was fun to see a rare good guy. However, the attraction of Bruce Cabot is a mystery to me - it is low and unusual in comparison, but I always thought he had just emerged, smiling, under a car, covered with grease and a sixth year. Some people like them this way, just like the character of Gene's gypsy queen. It's an adventure game, but as we have been warned about invasion of the local population with rifles, ready to sabotage and attack the British on their territory, there is a final battle in which we have to lose a main character of the good of everything. This feature requires nothing more than your closest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who has improved everything associated with it. It was almost more interesting to identify large retailers and a surprise appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her leading roles. Two or two and a half stars out of five.-MDM
