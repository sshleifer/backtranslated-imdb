First of all ... I never considered myself a Uwe Boll Hater because I never saw one of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a film called "Seed" (which is the name of the serial killer who tells) I am about to join the hate club. This film has absolutely no sense ... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to attract attention by shocking people, 90% of this film is simply boredom. You can summarize this movie as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. A hooded killer watches footage of animals being tortured on TV. These are real images of hen farms and the film begins with the ridiculous reason of "making a statement about humanity" and giving an address to Peta. Since this movie has no message and is the worst form of pornographic exploitation under torture, you already have a reason to hate it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electrocution with a pretext that betrays what will happen later in this film printed on the screen for each delay to receive it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch videos of hungry animals, babies and women decaying in the basement of Seeds, having stupid nightmares and crying their whiskey, because Seed is a bad guy mofo. Although the acting is good, the film plunges every time it tries to incorporate emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. The cops break Seed in his house, act stupidly and make themselves cut in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you hardly see anything other than flashlights. The seed is a super killer who is everywhere at once and all the cops look stupid enough to be killed ... except one who kicks it. <br /> <br /> 5. The seed takes the chair and we see its electrocution as long as the rest of this "film" ... it will not die and we recall the opening statement that it must be released if he survives three electric shocks. Guess what ... they bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. A seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone in another part, then asks the main cop to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman is hit in the head with a hammer in an infinite sequence from a point of view just for the pleasure and shock she has. <br /> <br /> 8. The seed captures the family of cops, pulls him home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself in the head, considering what Seed really wants (it's hard to get into that guy's head because he's not just wearing his mask, even in prison, but never say a word ... the movie has almost no dialogue, so do not mind). <br /> <br /> 9. Boll opts for a nihilistic shock where Seed locks the girl with her dead father rot like the people we saw on the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> That there is ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no decor except a stupid story that Seed was burned child. <br /> <br /> This film is based only on a few key scenes and their shock value. I hardly remember a film so empty of emotion, message or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... I'm ok, some people will appreciate this brazen snuff. But what is really difficult to bear is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well done considering the work of the camera, the effects and even the acting, it's too good for this wasted celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get money to make such "films" as thousands of talented directors work on a tight budget? "Seed" is not just the essence of ridicule, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... Fortunately, Uwe said the German taxpayer was paying a large chunk of this garbage for deductions.
