I am a sucker for a good romance, but it can not be described as good or romance. I had the plot nailed before the credits. With such a mediocre dialogue, plot and character development, I suggest investing your hour and a half elsewhere. For the third time, I had to hurry Serendipity to get rid of the bad taste of it.
