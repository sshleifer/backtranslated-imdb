Jobson seems to have forgotten an important aspect of the film: he has the capacity to tell a story by showing it to you. You do not have to tell the public what to think, because they will see it. The action here is interspersed with one of the heaviest narratives that the public did not suspect - the purple prose of the delicate fifth. And this should be useless, because it is a beautiful cast and some beautifully composed and filmed visuals. Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a little support. And maybe he was right, he lacks a fundamental credibility: Edinburgh in the 70s was not exactly filled with beautiful smart girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a faint for a sociopath who passes. Clothes too neat and new that the character brings to the intellectualism of the cod who tries to bind them, everything is too artificial for my taste.
