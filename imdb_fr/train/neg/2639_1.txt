Let's start with this review with the fact that I signed to write the review and warn people to save their money! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst garbage I've seen since The Hulk. The scenario was the most predictable trash you could possibly find. If you wait 24 years but on the big screen, empty them immediately with the money you would use to buy a ticket. You will get more pleasure this way. The acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (with the so-called "twist" at the end, I have to say this, the end surprised me, I'm not referring to the plot that surprised me but instead the effortless way they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of decent acts throughout the movie, they hastened the end so quickly that I did not even realized that it was over until I saw the credits rolling in. I considered burning the reel of film if I could find a way to get into this projection room. <br /> <br The casting was awful for several reasons: First, they had to have accidentally reversed the assignment of the characters, because Michael Douglas played the role that Keifer Sutherland should have played clearly while Douglas was sneaking around. agents, exchanged telephone lines, hacked and the people who were pursuing him, Sutherland was playing the less capable agent who ad even when things are not going so bad for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his type Jack Bauer we liked 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can best be compared to a remake of the "Fugitive" / "In The Line of Fire" but written by people with a mental disability.
