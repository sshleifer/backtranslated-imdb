or anyone who prayed for Al Cliver's sight fighting a black, tall, black man in a complete nelson, your movie has arrived! The movie star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group that is asking for the $ 6 million ransom to be delivered to their refuge on the island. Peter Weston (Cliver), a veteran from Vietnam, hired by a film producer to save the girl, does not count on them. And what they really did not count on was a local tribe who likes to offer young women to their god cannibal monster with bloodshot eyes. <br /> <br /> The filming is almost identical to that of CANNIBALS, that is a little more fun in terms of entertainment, thanks to a hilarious dub track and an incredibly awkward monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms that they shared ping-pong balls during the disk interview). Franco gets a solid support cast for EuroCult including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most annoying things I've ever seen as a guy totally different from him). The film contains tons of nudity and the gore (variety of Tempra paintings) is there. The highlight for me was the battle of fists in the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Unfortunately, old Jess gave him an amazing hour and 40 minutes (and sometimes dying) when he should have lasted 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the DVD Severin is rather pretty, but some ghost images appear during the darkest scenes. In addition, a long section of dialogue is in Spanish without submarines (they are an option, but only when you listen to the track in French). Franco gives a nice 16-minute interview on the film and has a lot more fun to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star, Sabrina Siani.
