EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, after defeating Freddy at the end of the last movie, is trying now to readjust his life. But his unborn child carries a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to reappear in their world. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note the directors who had their big successes in making Freddy's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Good evening, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But if Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO did something of a podge with this entry, which should be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly stretching as far as possible here, with Freddy ridiculously a father himself and the ridiculous baby demon. Even after about an hour and a half, all of this becomes quite tedious and, of course, not at all scary. <br /> <br /> The slogan "good appetite, slut" is the only memorable point of this other wise entry very forgotten. *
