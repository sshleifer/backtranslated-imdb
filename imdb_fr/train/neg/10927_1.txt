The critics for this film were lukewarm at best, with huge expectations: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a fun idea, and a leading actress that everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's so-called humorous journey into the imaginary world fails to entertain her audience at all (I did not hear a single laugh throughout the presentation). a sign of the magic he wished to have. The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with awkward direction and some good actors are doing their best to become professionals in a function that certainly could not seem such a good idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'Alice Tremblay's Odyssey' is a collage of comic sketches, connected to a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
