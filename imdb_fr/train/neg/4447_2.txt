Yes, there are worse movies out there. Most of them are made for fun, on a tight budget, or as a television. movie of the week, but even if it was the "movie of the week", it would not give more than two stars. It is a mediocre film about a serious subject depicting an abused woman who flees the king slimes to the protective arms of the king of nipples. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her, the man is superfluous for the film and should not be included at all). There is no suspense, no character development, and a heroine who could be thwarted by a red onion. (I think she throws her ring on a boat with an autonomous tank rather than dropping it overboard into the ocean (where her body should be anyway)) and after the husband finds her, demonstrating she's a moron, she continues to do I'm always amazed at the generally high ranking of a film like this and realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work. After laughing at humanity, I cry.
