It's harder to believe how Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie, I thought Manos: The hands of fate was the worst shit I had ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you risk falling asleep, thus saving your eyes from the pain that he will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this film is that the old man who keeps the Hobgoblins "locked up" goes to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
