Wow, here he is finally; the action "film" without action. In a budget environment (do not miss the hilarious flying saucers that fly several times) of a future Seattle, we find a brainless body that seeks to avenge his childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the performance of the actors is matched only stupidly the attempt to steal other films, mainly " Matrix "without having the money to do it properly. Yes, we sometimes see running on walls and slow-motion shots (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are about as cool as this stupid hardbody's attempts to joke about male incompetence from time to time. <br /> <And, yes, we also receive a number of tracks that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the scenario had been thought by the unpublished distribution during the shooting of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, he's as bad as he can. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps I can make sure that some of you do not rent it and save your money.
