This film on paper seemed to be good, after watching it, I realized that this movie was completely terrible !! The plot does not make sense, and I think I counted the best part of the 5,000 cut scenes making each one more annoying and ridiculous. I looked at this black night, no noise at all, just to add to the fear, but the truth is the only thing that scared me is the music, what they call a tragic music , they play opera, I mean to be serious !! This film summarizes all that is wrong with this type of film. To be honestly sick, do not say more, but look at your own risk, this film is a waste, ENJOY!
