I agree with the critics I read here and I have no words to define such a turkey like this, but still, I can always find a reason for such films to exist. Do you remember those happy days when video was a successful business and where many movies were shot for the sole purpose of filling the shelves of video stores? this film comes from this period and I guess that was the only reason it was produced and the same thing happened with many, many, many other stealthies. Do you remember imitations "Rambo"? and so many grade Z slashers ?, I still feel nostalgia for this period.About this movie, I can say that I did not waste my time watching it because I pressed the button. fast forward after the first fifteen minutes, just for Fun scene in which a guy was pushing an ax against exploding heads because, as you'll notice, they were plastic. And towards the end, well, it was so badly filmed that I could not understand what had happened. It's the same, I did not follow the non-existent plot at all. But dude, Video-age was a big age despite movies like this one.
