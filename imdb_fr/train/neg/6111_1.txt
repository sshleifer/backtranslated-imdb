Bo Derek will not stay in the story as a great actress. On the other hand, from the 1980s, true acting talent seemed less and less essential to Hollywood. Bo could very well have embarked on more ambitious projects after Blake Edwards 'big hit in '10.' That's if she had not let her husband, John Derek, take charge of his career. Many Playboy movies and bad movies like this (this one in particular) directed by John have destroyed her momentum and made her the target of many jokes. In the 1980s, it was assumed that one could put a certain personality in a certain film and that it would be the gold of the box office. John thought putting Bo in a movie where she was naked for much of the race time would make people flock to the theater after the hype. Maybe if the movie had been good maybe. This version of Tarzan must be the worst of all time among the many interpretations of Burrough's jungle lord, a slap in the face of the character's book and movie. Tarzan is actually an afterthought, because the film is above all a vehicle for Bo's breasts and Richard Harris' superb rendition (remember, the couple had worked together at Orca). His staging helps you stay awake during boredom and, yes, the movie is rather boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by a trance. Bo's body can only lead you so far. Miles O'Keeffe, who played at least Tarzan, would start a long and enjoyable career in the movie B. Richard Harris could leave him behind after his recent acting success, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two served to show why his career as a director and his acting career have passed away. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan come to Africa?
