America needs the best man to win "The game" so who do they hire? A gymnast (Oh brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas who possesses the necessary skills to win in a game involving ninjas, a village of madmen and Richard Norton to whom Kurt Thomas asks to "keep his gear in his pants". (His exact words) I missed it in theaters and that's a good reason, because I probably would have been expelled because of the laughter that I popped up at regular intervals. The first thing that stuck in my head was how lame these ninjas were if a gymnast could kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 inches and he barely strikes one as "The best man for work" As for Kurt Thomas's acting talent, fine if you can not say something nice ... Seriously , one has to wonder how much cocaine has been used to provide such a stupid idea. Only the decision to give Tara Reid the role of scientist illustrates it here. It's been 18 years that this is the title of the most stupid movie I have ever seen. Not to say that I did not find it unbearable, I laughed so hard that I almost choked. Two times. It was only in the 80s that a film with such a bad idea can be made. For the story, it's the only movie ever to have staged such a lamentable hero that he can not even shoot a stuck sword off the ground. It's the most wimpiest action movie ever, and one of the hilarious ones too. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
