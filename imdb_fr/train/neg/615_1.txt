I must say that I usually like horror movies that I have never seen ... However, this one was too pathetic for my taste gore. I'm used to bloody and heartbreaking guys ... but this movie in particular was nil. The acting was awful (yet the nerdy one-liners were cute). And later, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when he came out for the first time, there was a huge eulogy about it and people liked it. But when films like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, films like these give the impression that films like Scarecrow look childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are tacky. But since it was a low-budget film, I can sort of see where it would go. This will remind you somehow the movie "Children Of The Corn". Independent movies are rock .... most of the time. So, if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with ears of corn, or in the aftermath, two scarecrows, then these movies would be for you.
