Normally, I would not feel qualified to review anything I've seen for half an hour, but I'll make an exception for this one. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some lines of the wrong type: "I feel ... teacher!" "Sorry, Professor, you get an 'F!'" <br /> <br /> A bad guy and a bad girl (just after killing two cops and stealing a pickup truck full of drugs, they get hot and heavy): < Him - "So what do you think of shooting innocent bystanders?" <br /> <br /> Her- (purrs) "You know how to give a girl a good time ..." A generic child who has run for his life instead of helping someone, has to summarize his life and his personality in this line - "I AM A CHICKEN-TWIT!" (It was the USA network version) My old man was right! No wonder he left us ... "Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Not really a spoiler) The bad guy (on fire) yells "Aargh! Fire!"
