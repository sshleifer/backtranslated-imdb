When I started watching this film, I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors, but I soon realized that this movie was talking about people on a train. The interactions between people are similar to the ones you can see every day on the street and when, sometimes, the situation is a bit more interesting, the dialogue becomes frozen and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this film tries to describe the way people interact, it's just that in this film they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze this type of relationship, you'd better go buy a train ticket and watch the people on the train with you. It's realistic, but you would not go to the movies to watch a movie where you would watch the movie.
