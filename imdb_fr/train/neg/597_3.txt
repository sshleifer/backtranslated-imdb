This film is a perfect example of the recent wave of horror movies that are simply not fully realized. In horror movies, there are two ways: either you do not really explain what's happening (or who is the murderer, as in Texas Chainsaw Massacre), or you give the characters a lot of stories and characters for that everything be explained (Halloween could be an example). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a little bit of Craig's story without fully grasping the essence of his character or motivation. No character is completely realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is largely unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it exciting or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and the realization of empty films lying around movie. <br /> <br /> This film will remain as another example of a film (as most are) it could be so much better even if it would never be great. The only thing that was used correctly in the film was the setting: characters, history, direction and writing in general would have benefited from a serious facelift. <br /> <br /> Creep has an unthinking purpose, a stupid horror movie without intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately that's about it ...
