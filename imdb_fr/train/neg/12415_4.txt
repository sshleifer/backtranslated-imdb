I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was nothing more than a very bland and classic police series in which, as in any Quinn Martin show, Act I was murder, Act II was the character main perpetrator of the assassination, act III was the plot (another murdered character), act IV was the resolution and the epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his stepfather Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen ) how he had discovered the crime, then someone saying something witty at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember is the excellent theme song by the late great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely, the opening credits sequence made me want to see the show from time to time during the seven seasons it was aired. I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett, while Ebsen was very misplaced. I just wanted the show to be more fun than when I remembered it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube via their Archive of American Television channel. Let's just say I was nicer than Goldsmith about Barnaby Jones.
