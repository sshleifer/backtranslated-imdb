This film is an insult to ALL submariners. It was stupid. It seemed to have been written by monkeys. The acting game was absurd. If this is the opinion of most people on the navy, I cry for our defense. This film was awful. I put it below "Journey to the bottom of the sea" with regard to underwater movies. Gene Hackman must have really needed a rent to make this shit. Denzel Washington had to be high. Little in the plot makes sense. And the end. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this trash. If you have not figured it out yet, I did not like it. And if there had not been any pro comments, I would not have bothered to post.
