I can not believe I'm wasting my time looking at this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave it the "AA" rating. For TV movies, it's usually a reliable indicator of quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The interpretation was satisfactory, but whoever wrote it should be denied access forever. to any means of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivations of the "bad guys" totally absent, and the various ridiculous and superficial family interactions. For example, Dad preaches that the violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be an "admirable" person, NOT because of his philosophy of "ignoring idiots", but because he is good enough with his fists ... <br /> <br /> The only message I got from this bill is that the nuclear family is a good person and alternative lifestyles are bad. Oh, and the wrong people come to the right people.
