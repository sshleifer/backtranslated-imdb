Only recently have I been able to catch up with Marilyn Miller's films because they are not shown on the MCT in the UK. I've been very intrigued over the years because it was one of the superstars of the '20s. For some of the stars of that era like Jolson, the magic always shines through, but sadly not for Miller. His dance seems clumsy and poorly choreographed, her singing a little limited and as an actress, she gives Ruby Keeler the appearance of Hepburn.Emplemently worse while the audience was tired of musicals, virtually all the numbers were removed. So we end up with a comedy from this unappealing period. She was paid $ 500,000 for that! So I have only two conclusions. Either she was badly served by the cinema, or she had no talent. I think the truth is closer to the last one than this one.
