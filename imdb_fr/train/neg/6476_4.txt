I had high hopes for this film because I loved the original so much. It seems however that Disney is trying to perfect the art of the rotten suites directly on DVD. They deserve a raid. Many in fact. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely horrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music that Disney had in his movies? Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback of Our Lady. Over the years, they have shot so much in the movies that it is really sad to want to make suites that are not even good enough to be screened. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the Walt Disney Corporation.
