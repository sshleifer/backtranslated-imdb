It is a bad season for Bollywood with all the important outings with a huge hype that turns out to be box office misses. London Dreams does not escape that. Let's say the dissect ... It's about pursuing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve them. Sounds impressive, right? But unfortunately, the film is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to do things big one day. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 spectators shouting his name. He is accompanied by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (newcomers, Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a lovely Priya (Asin). Together, they form "London Dreams", their dream group. After impressing the head of a record company, they become sensations overnight. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya and he does not want to reveal it until he reaches his goal. Arjun then invites his childhood friend Manjit Khosla, aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a rogue and naughty guy who has no ambition in life, to join his group. Mannu is a skilled musician and a true talent for whom later on, Arjun became envious for Mannu's superior skills and his affair with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to destroy Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects, we only feel the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha that we admired at Namaste London. It was like he was just visualizing the scenario. To make short, a glorified cameraman. Suresh Nair's screenplay is dull even though he has his strong moments. Predictably defined, the scenario weighs you down. The camera work was great for capturing the beauty of London. This is the only fun part to watch songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are humble, while others are passable. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he annoys you. Asin is forgettable and I do not think she will succeed in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK. Brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in countless movies. Ompuri is in the process. I do not want to dwell on the flaws, because it will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me sum it up simply, London Dreams is a soulless movie that you can enjoy better on DVD.
