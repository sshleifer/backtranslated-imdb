"Dutch Schultz", aka Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a very real person and his rather unpleasant life is quite well documented. This film that claims to portray his life should have used a fictional character, because the events too dramatized are a gap too strong in relation to facts and chronology. In addition, he ignores some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the public relations fiasco in New York State and its religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, and. Al. But it's as far as it goes. The explosive plate scene depicting Luciano executing Bo Weinberg's execution in his own home, assisted by his own mother, is ridiculous. In addition, there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Diamond Legs. It does not work. Mrs. Fleggenheimer's character does not work either. This film does not need a loving Jewish mother for the comic. The lame representation of Diamond Legs was humorous enough. I'm sure the man is turning in his grave. And, moreover, the Dutch have actually killed people personally, but he was not Rambo nor 007. The scene in which he annihilates the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I did not understand it.
