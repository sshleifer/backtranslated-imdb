It's really terrible: painfully irritating stylized artists scream and cling grumpy and incoherent dialogues that unfold in scenes that seem endless, without beginning, middle or end, cut together without any apparent narrative or cognitive intent, all in the service of a "story" totally uninteresting and almost undetectable. The pretensions of the film to a "style" only make matters worse: suddenly a remote-controlled crane turns spiral and, for no apparent reason, there are whips or manageable sections: all this "style" does nothing that magnify The almost unbelievably large false idea of ​​the project and the almost offensive emptiness of the material. Certainly a candidate for the worst film of all time.
