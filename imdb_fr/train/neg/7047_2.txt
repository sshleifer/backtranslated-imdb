Be warned: neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role, as the poster would like. Their roles are actually minor. <br /> <br /> The film oscillates between an exaggerated comedy and a realistic drama, neither is really engaging. Especially I find it impossible to arouse much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his fellatio friends and his fiance obsessed with sex. The plot drags terribly, and I turned it off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as I like to finish what I'm starting. The good acting and the beautiful surroundings carry it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
