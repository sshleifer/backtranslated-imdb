When anti-bush jokes get really easy to do, a series like this should also make sure it has something more. When this little extra, they are childish versions of political figures making jokes about the future that they do not have yet, it is simply absurd. Dick Cheney and George Bush were successful, but Dick Cheney mumbles above all. There is also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for whatever reason and Donald Rumsfeld who does not look like Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic characters seldom give their name, so it's hard to know who this might be except for Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes have consistent stories, but that's not enough to stop it from sinking.
