I do not know what Donald Sutherland's actor style or vocal style is, but he always seems to be behind a huge, wet pack of Kleenex. He's just ... I do not know, thick? Somnambulist? On drugs? Bizarre. <br /> <br /> That said, I just saw the movie for the first time since its initial release, and frankly, I do not remember that it ended something like that. A bad end, too, because nothing is attached. And the deceased husband? The boring child (and the child has been doubled?) Scotland Yard and the military prosecutors? I would have liked something to finish and finish dramatically, not just the great scenic clearance. <br /> <br /> And what woman is sleeping with the man she knows who has just killed her husband? Even if she tried to dispel Needle's suspicions of protecting her child, she could have always had a headache. This last meeting made me feel very irritated and uncomfortable ...
