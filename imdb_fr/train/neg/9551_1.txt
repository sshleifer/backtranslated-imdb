It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Discover where the "movie" "War Games - The Dead Code" was filmed 2) Watch the original war games with my current movie computer skills and the eyes of a preteen 1983. 3) Enter the pentagon's computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and memorized. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER to tell NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE a few minutes before the first day of shooting 5) Come back to the present, grab a beer and ask Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "flash" my blank memory of the whole event, especially my original display of "The Dead Code" 6) Take another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next remake of a GOOD 80's movie. <br /> 8) Did I forget I killed Jar Jar. I'm not sure if I have to travel in the future for that. I may need access to a wormhole.
