<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie with a famous actor in the lead role to be a fun movie. That is not the case here. I laughed once in all the film, and it was not even the case during the last comedy scene (which we would also expect to be the funniest). It's a program that you can watch when it comes to television, do not spend other funds to rent it.
