I saw it recently and I must say that I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not quite work. However, I can not wait to watch the documentary produced by the producers who organized this project, because I think it would be a much more convincing job than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast was composed of B-class actors, but their role was appropriate, and I must give a special mention to the young actress who played Holly. It was her first movie role and she did a very good job, considering that hers is the hardest part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was adequate but sweet like Patrick, the American whose goal is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn played well his final role. Unfortunately, despite my rather favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, these two actors were really forgettable and did not do their best work in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and the intention of this film, but I must be fair, so I note "Holly" 3 stars for its faults as a film. But I think that the subject deserves serious attention and I am glad that the authors of this film also made a documentary that I hope will have its debut on the BBC and other television channels.
