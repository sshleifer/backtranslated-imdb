Okay, during this past Thanksgiving break, when the whole family was reunited, everyone had decided to go see a movie. Since Fred Clause was elected by majority, that's what we went to say. <br /> <br /> To begin the film, there were so many holes in the plot that it was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a certain event was happening were nil. Example; who the hell is trying to "close" Santa's clause? Is it a kind of society? A small explanation would have been lovely. <br /> <br /> Second: the film has shown you fragile characters who did not arouse any sympathy from their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only big girl in the village of elves. they see each other twice and then they form a couple and I could care less because this movie did not pay attention to me. <br /> <br /> Third: I guess it was supposed to be a family film? His mark was low at just PG. For a family film, there were several suggestive conversation articles. It did not bother me, but if I was a parent, I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti seemed extremely bored by his role, but honestly, he was the only one watching in the movie. Vaughn had some fun moments but played the same character he had for the last two movies. gaping frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie has 3 out of 10 stars of me, just because someone had to make the effort to produce, shoot and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely pass this movie, or if you have to see it, keep it for a rainy day rental.
