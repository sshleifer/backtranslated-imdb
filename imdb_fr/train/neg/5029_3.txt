"After the explosion of atomic bombs carried by a Soviet bomber shot down in the Arctic, the creature 'Gammera' is free from hibernation.The giant prehistoric turtle goes on a path to Tokyo and destroys everything in its path. 'The army and the scientific community rushes to find a way to stop this monster before Tokyo is wasted,' according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> The re-produced version for the American public of this movie, the first film of the series "Gamera", adds material in English even more funny than the Japanese rate regularly doubled. Clearly, the monster follows in the footsteps of "Godzilla". By taking example on "Batman!" The television series, the ridiculous theme song of the musician Wes Farrell reinforces the appeal of the camp of the American version. <br /> <br /> *** *** Gammera the Invincible (15/12/66) Sandy Howard, Noriaki Yuasa ~ Dick O'Neill, Brian Donlevy, Albert Dekker, John Baragrey
