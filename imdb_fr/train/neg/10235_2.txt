The only reason I give it a 2 is that the filmography is so stylized nowadays that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This film is asin. It's like so many other fodders of the 21st century. The gore is free and simply outrageous. I did not care at all about one of the characters, but I was worried about a moron bothering to get their hands on it: I was complaining about the money I had spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to the nearby theater. to watch the movie "Live Free or Die Hard", adventurous and entertaining, which probably got a much higher note from me simply because I endured the complete fucking of "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
