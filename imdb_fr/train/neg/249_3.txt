I saw this film in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was great as a Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so terribly. Sometimes I could not help but laugh at the stupid game and the reply: "Merry Christmas everyone!" Other times, I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a news from Charles Dickens about a rich man, who does not think Christmas is anything but hormone. After 30 minutes, the rich guy receives the visit of three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this film, with a scenario so bad that it had to be written in five minutes, can be so well noted. Instead of this trash, I recommend Bill Murray's comedy, Scrooged. At least it was funny ...
