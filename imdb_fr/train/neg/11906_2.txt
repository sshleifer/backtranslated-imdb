Watching "Der himmel über Berlin" as a teenager in the late 80s was a profound experience for me - "so that's what movies could be". With "Paris, Texas" and "At the end of the world", he always occupies a special place in my heart and in my mind - a testimony of the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in recent years there has been a steady decline in the quality of his work with "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" reaching a terrible low point. No more captivating images or music. No research or display of great insight. There are only characters and political statements barely veiled, which boils down to clichés and make a mockery of the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to step up or stop altogether.
