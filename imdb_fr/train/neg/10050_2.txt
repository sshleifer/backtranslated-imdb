A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on "Homecoming" of the first season was twisted and gloomily hilarious in every way. This mishandling of an intriguing premise has left me perplexed. The supposed "reward" for generic extraterrestrials extracting something from the brain of infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the purpose of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet from its human infestation, why did they take it in such a sadistic and misogynistic way? Why not just unleash a deadly virus like Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of letting the male population slaughter women? I was hoping the episode would get better as I continued to watch, but it was becoming more pretentious and absurd. The religious subtext seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought his weight was deep. I really like the work of Dante and Hamm, but it was simply unassailable.
