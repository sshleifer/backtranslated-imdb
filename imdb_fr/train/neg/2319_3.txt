Many stupid field holes in the movie. We see him first watching his teacher practice kung fu and die in the middle of his practice. It's okay with me. And then at the end of the film, we see him using the kung fu he learned while watching his master when he was still a child. Is it possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is for Jay Chou fans only. The film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinematic styles, and storyline unfolding. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that the captain of the basketball team (his forgotten name) and the idolatrous player Li Xiao are so alike, to the point that one might think that they are the same person? Long hair, sunshine-boy look, big and strong. It looked like they were both coming out of a mass production facility designed to produce products that would allow teenage girls to scream wildly at orgasm. It's not that these two actors have anything precious to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> The scene regarding Jay Chou's 4 masters coming back to help him in the basketball court, degenerated into a useless plot when they started hitting their opponents in the manner of Royal Rumble . Worse, when the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd cheered and the match continued. It was really a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to the excellent skills of Jay Chou in kung fu. The way he acquired these kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show shows him somehow by acquiring the skills simply by observing his master. <br /> <br /> And his father, long lost, comes out of the wood to thank Jay Chou, his long-lost son, seemed a little too fast of the director to conclude the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a film by Jay Chou (instead of "classic film"). . Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those on the list of the 250 best films of all time IMDb, then this movie is not for you.
