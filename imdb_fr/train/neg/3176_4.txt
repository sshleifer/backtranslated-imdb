The charming Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushed her before the "I do" with her fiance Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry still has not moved and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe asks Henry to talk to an attractive psychic, Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley must contact Kate's spirit in the hope of helping Henry continue his life. When the medium begins to be attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost appears to stifle romance in the bud. There are funny situations. but if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the movie's content. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell had stolen the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the buttocks. Still, this movie was overexcited.
