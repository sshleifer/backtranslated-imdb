I gave myself a personal mission to attack the makers of this film. I even asked the rental company to refund my money because I maintained that they had perpetrated false advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the film itself is a record, but the cover is what sold me. On Halloween, the effects of makeup on my kids were better than those described in the movie compared to the cover art. Can you say "raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste more of my time going into the details, but the main character of the movie is a LA policeman who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent !? ! It's more insulting.
