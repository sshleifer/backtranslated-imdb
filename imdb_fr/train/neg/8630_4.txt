I know that in this episode, there is something else that I'm going to talk about, and in fact I think it has virtues; For example, after receiving a very negative opinion of Jin as a result of Sun's flashbacks in "The House of the Rising Sun," we see Jin's side and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is one element in this story that has made me so deeply uncomfortable that it has greatly diminished the enjoyment of this entire episode. Previously, in the scene where Jin had appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, he had been hinted that Sun's father was a person who became rich through illicit and dubious methods. I thought he might even be a mafia boss; Crowds operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world. So it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode, we learn that Sun's father is actually the boss (or one of the main leaders) of a Korean automobile company and that what Jin did was physically attack a government official (who was going to actually being murdered) His name. <br /> <br /> I may be particularly sensitive to this because I work in the auto industry, but I would say it's EXTREMELY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing happens in Korea. ; these huge, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model of this fictitious automobile business, because they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) work with these mafia methods, instead of resembling any normal automobile business in the world. Where is. It's just amazing to me that writers have the nerve to write something like this in history, and that there has been no turmoil in Korea about it. He feels like stranger "Buy American!" propaganda, describing foreign auto companies as criminal, untrustworthy third-world outfits.
