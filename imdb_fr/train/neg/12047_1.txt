I had the greatest enthusiasm for the advanced projection of this film. After all, it's one of humanity's oldest and most complex stories, and it's one of the first epic tales I read in my childhood (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a huge disappointment. They completely transformed the plot into a joke and turned it into a long story. The elements that were true to the plot were scattered in such a random way that the audience laughed numerous times about the idiotic scenario that was just greeting from start to finish this battle of all the battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who associates a strange combination of almost matrix powers, absolute cruelty and male lovers in the original poem) turned to "Fabio on the beach" in the guise of Pitt with a good script and more effort, it could have become the most complex and original warrior figure ever produced by Hollywood). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the most of a ridiculous scenario. It was actually a loss of talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and he does not even hold a candle for them. Many guys for the ladies to hide but not enough battle scenes for a movie that lasts about a battle and a seat. I would not recommend anyone to pay to see this story dragged into the dust, as did one of the characters (at least they understood this part).
