I will begin by apologizing to filmmakers around the world for using the terms "filmmaker", "film" or "film" in connection with this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh . <br /> The writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The staging: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The acting game: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too inept for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills needed to assemble this atrocity: NO ONE. <br /> <br /> This waste block could hardly be called the cinema. The majority of family family films are closer to this distinction than Revenge Quest. No, it's just a stack of 10 cars filmed. <br /> <br /> We will ignore the plot in this article because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let's just say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. Calling one-dimensional acting would give them credit. The little that there is here is atrocious to begin with, and aggravated by the terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, it should be the effects ... or rather its worrying lack. There are no blanks in the pistols, no flashpots, and the few sound effects that existed were either "gun" sounds or they were generated by the mouth (yeah, you read that right). The filmmaker had the audacity to record a "shh" for the doors of the elevator; I guess he felt it made them more futuristic. This is supposed to be fixed in 2031, after all. This does not explain the sounds he has created by mouth for fist scenes, however. <br /> <br /> If it was not bad enough that the sound quality was terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of Reserve gun sounds were almost worse than not using sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a flock of sheep, and they are just as clumsy. Imagine this: the villain enters a building in search of his prey A lady begins to run in fear. He raises his weapon (an uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from the camera and suddenly a single bag of blood (one) bursts on her back (it looks like she was hit by a paintball) and she falls flat on her stomach. <br /> <br /> know that my description is too much justice to the inefficiency of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, a sequence that makes the film quite funny to watch, but which happens quite funny, takes place in a stairwell. . The villain pursues the good guy and the lady he protects on the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi. You may want to dodge; There are bad sound effects that fly everywhere. <br /> <br /> I suppose Alan DeHerrera can not be locked up for designing this train wreck, but he continued editing and publishing. . If there is justice, there will be a karma with its name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to look at this pile of industrial waste - and I strongly advise against it - be sure to watch for entire scenes lifted almost verbatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that also serves as a talkie- talkie. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it will only hurt you if you do it. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And it's generous.
