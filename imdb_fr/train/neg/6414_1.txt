This is the worst piece of Cr4p I have ever seen in my life. It hardly made sense. It was not scary at all (unless you classify as scary loud noises and cries?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar has to stop with these ridiculous horror movies. I think everyone in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits were cumulated. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst films ever made, here's how it would be: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> < The reason I did Silent Hill 3rd was because some scenes were scary, but the rest was totally crazy. Same thing with the fever of the cabin, it did not make sense, but the return to the top of the list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever together
