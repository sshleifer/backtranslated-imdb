I really liked Bilal's graphic novel when he came out and I was surprised when I saw the trailer for this movie, and even more so when I discovered that Bilal had made it himself . The film, however, was a major disappointment. The visuals are far from the rich and grainy texture of the original works of art, and the story is poorly told. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do it very well either. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both out of the moment and in the right place, forced together by the circumstances. Above all, they were funny and friendly. Not so here. Nikopol has no visible personality, and Horus is a pompous idiot who just wants to get laid. Even if the film is in French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We have all seen movies that we liked, but that we do not recommend to everyone, for one reason or another. I would not recommend Immortal to anyone except perhaps as a warning not to abuse your talent and resources. Bilal is a great storyteller, but obviously not a master of all visual aids.
