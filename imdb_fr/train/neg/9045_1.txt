This film began with a semblance of intrigue, then abandoned it for an infinite series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with the progression of the story. It was impossible to stay engaged with this movie. This film is a very cynical pile of waste made by some people with animation skills, but totally lacking in creativity or narrative ability. It's a shocking effort from a big studio. Clearly, there are motivation and motivation problems at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. This management allowed this film to see the light of day says a lot about their incompetence and despair. This film joins my very short list of "worst movies of all time".
