This film is a bit like Conan the barbarian, but with more sex, rapes and murders. There is a plot somewhere below all this debauchery but the filmmakers do not do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a strong performance in the lead role, as does the villain - which unfortunately did not feature in anything else to note. Combat scenes are not that bad either - I like the way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's a lot of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> Overall, not good - but not necessarily so bad either ...
