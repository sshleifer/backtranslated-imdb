I love horror movies with cheese. I do not care if the acting is mediocre or the monsters look corny. I liked this film, except that I felt confused from the beginning to the end of the film. Look, I do not need a 10-page essay or a big billboard explaining a conspiracy. But Dark Floors takes the "what is this movie?" thing to a whole new level (boring). What is this movie about? <br /> <br /> This is not particularly scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to feel frustrated and confused, praise this winner.
