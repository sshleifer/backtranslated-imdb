I'm stunned to sit and watch this. I love independent movies, horror movies and everything about zombies in general. But when you add ningas, you have crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this movie had a good time doing it, so at least it was not a total waste. You would never know by looking at it though. Scenario? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were pretending. Cinematography? Well, there had to be a camera there. Period. I do not think there was any real planning in the making of this movie. A waste of time so total that I will not extend it by commenting more.
