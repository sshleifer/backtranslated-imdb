Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after the death of her husband, so she turns to the culture of ganja to pay the bills. It sounds promising and Brenda Blethyn, always reliable, does not disappoint, but the material is very fine. There is actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" and thinks she is asking for sex and is acting clumsily. Yes, it's humor, so a nun would be bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what he wants to be: the astonishing cinematography and its imposing rhythm evoke memories of Ryan's daughter, while the faint fantasy of the townspeople of the countryside could be drawn from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but at that moment, it's too clich√© to care. The climax is unpredictable only by the introduction of Two ex Machina, the most brazen I have ever seen.
