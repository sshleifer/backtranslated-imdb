Where is it written that suites must suck? Scream 2 does not have! Others do not! But this one had of course ... problems with horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could play in the whole movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on and I've even done some research on the idea of ​​Nephilim) horrible choices for casting. Eric Roberts is the most stupid archangel Michael I have ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague, unless you're desperate to see Christopher Walken. In this case, simply advance in the parts where it is in the film and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
