Much worse than the original. It was in fact * painful * to get through, and it was barely enough for my six-year-old. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pok√©mon is slightly interesting, but the plot is extremely thin, the dialogue is always bad and the music is mediocre. Watch the TV show instead - it's much better.
