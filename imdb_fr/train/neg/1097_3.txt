I realize that the US military was demoralized in 1971, but this film was incredible. It was a training camp, not the SS punishment battalion in a novel by Sven Hassell. The writer must be a real enemy of the army. The psychopathic sergeant who was still hitting the shit of people belonged to a prison cell and the useless sergeant Black Top should have been fired too. These men were going abroad, the receiving units would have wondered where all the unsuitable recruits were coming from and an investigation would have followed. The scene that completely exploded was that of electrocution. Farrell, the alleged barracks lawyer, reportedly ordered the instructor to carry a barrel for issuing an illegal order (torturing prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention), assaulting a man enlisted, sexually assaulted and conduct unworthy of an officer. In fact, he's leaving. After that, the discipline falls to an insane level and the film becomes unassailable. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
