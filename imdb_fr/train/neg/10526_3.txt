The tedious film of the girls of the Reform school plays a bit like a film about a prison. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck there after fleeing his violent father. Once in the de facto prison, she is raped by a group of "detained" women. <br /> <br /> Overlong (even at 98 minutes), with a totally useless ending that makes all the film useless. <Br /> <br /> Linda Blair, 15, does her best not to show her body without a garment, but lets a nipple slip in a shower. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on *** *
