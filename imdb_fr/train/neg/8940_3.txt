"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol's Bureau 17, specializing in hidden (I think) criminals. She has the eye of destiny, good in her hands, dangerous if someone else has it. <br /> <br /> Office 17 caught a satanist from California, Hyde (no relation to Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz of the Los Angeles Police Department travels to England to take him back to the United States. Lutz is the link to previous Witchcraft movies, having already been played by Stephanie Beaton in Witchcraft 9. In Part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; at 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> The role of Lutz at 9 was not very big, but she is one of the main stars of it. Even though she has left behind high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing highs in this one. And this time, she has scenes of nudity and sex. Beaton is quite attractive in the role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. An anonymous clubgoer has a fatal trio with two vampires, the Satanist and the vampire chief stubbornly misbehave, Lutz finds an English friend and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character of The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this one, although Lutz mentions it to Bureau Agent 17, Dixon, in a conversation about vampires. She also calls her partner Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), but does not hear him finish. <br /> <br /> Hyde was released from prison by a group of vampires led by Raven, for a Walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines very flat, while Raven is too aggressive. The fight scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The audio in the film was quite poorly recorded and edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost under a music or deafening sirens. Cinematography is not great either. The film was shot and shot in the UK was a novelty however, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good like Celeste; attractive, certainly, but more importantly, she is unquestionably the best actor of the film (despite the deplorable scenes of combat). I am quite surprised that his filmography is so small. If there is a Witchcraft XIV someday, and I bet there will be one, they should bring it back, even if it means bringing it to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone or in DVD Hotter Than Hell collection with Witchcraft XI and two independent movies.
