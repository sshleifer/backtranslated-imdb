After reading for many years how awesome this film was, how he had established Ruiz among French critics (especially the posh crowd of Cahiers), I finally found him disappointing about a year ago. expectations were exorbitant). Shot in black and white saturated, this deliberately cerebral film (designed for television and, fortunately, only lasts an hour) is told in the form of a conversation between an art lover and an off-screen narrator who meditate to through a series of paintings. (which are shown in the style of live paintings) and try to find out if they hold clues to a hidden political crime. (Kate Beckinsale's horrible film, Uncovered, has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in the reviews of this film, but I would say that almost all of Borges' stories are more interesting than this movie.
