As a young black / latina woman, I'm always looking for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie at the video store, I thought I would like it. unfortunately, I do not have. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story has simply not been developed properly. The movie was constantly hanging around and many characters appearing on the screen come and go without contributing too much to the film in general. If the director did a better job of interconnecting the scenes, I might have appreciated a little more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" on this one every day. I was just not too impressed.
