Would have done better to strengthen considerably by doing it as a <br /> <br /> episode of 50 minutes of outer limits. Too much superfluous stuff and stuff like the bad guy who seemed to have escaped from the opera ghost did not help. The whole sequence of "The Night of the Living Dead" was extremely stupid and useless. After all, if the dead punished someone for their sins, now remind me exactly who was killing everyone?
