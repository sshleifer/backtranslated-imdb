James Bond in the desert? Well, that's how it is: Pierce Brosnan is best known under the pseudonym Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot before this release. Frankly, the two main roles of the film are both dubious, with Brosnan in a slightly more convincing performance and Annie Galipeau (Pony, the love interest of Gray Owl) having to fight with a carefree dialogue. <br /> <br /> The two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the film does not concern aunts. It's the wild nature of Canadian nature. And even if photography is beautiful, the harsh reality of life in the wilderness does not matter. Annie Galipeau, as a Pony, did not convince, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe it. She was about twenty years relatively inexperienced in this film and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps not severe enough with her. It makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is ... but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is certain, it always seems perfect. But mascara and eyebrows thickening in the desert? It just does not fit, especially since she seems to never do anything but try out in the woods with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl) and uses photo shoots to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I have lived with the forest dwellers of the Pacific Northwest, and they are just not as beautiful and stay so nice while fighting for their survival. Which brings me to another point: the film does not evoke the period in which it unfolds: the 1930s. I blame here largely a scenario without luster that likes to preach at the expense of dramatic arcs, points intrigue and these little details that can evoke a period through the action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the screenplay and his latest offer, "Elizabeth, The Golden Age", was opened three days ago. So I hope there will be an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the comments that others posted, but I'm not convinced. Lots of potential, but poorly managed and even poorly designed. If he had had a religious film, he would have been swept away, but because he preaches environmentalism, the film remains a little above criticism, since it is "politically correct". Sorry for all that, I do not buy it. Amen.
