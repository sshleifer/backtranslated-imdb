I feel much less generous with this film than others. The representation of the lunatics of this century is always so bizarre as to be a different species. Their antics are so outrageous that they are totally fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical person; or they have a fascination for chickens. They are fighting or fighting. It's as if the screenwriter has said, what can I get them to do, without realizing what madness or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful human representation in "Flight over a Cuckoo's Nest" where diseases are credible and real. I have already worked in a public psychiatric hospital. I did not see any of these guys. They are too smart and too calculating to give them life.
