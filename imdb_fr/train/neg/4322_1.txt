Keep reading and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (that was all!). <br /> <br /> Tirelessly dark, this film aims to produce (I guess) a small modern city, a festive American Christmas in the style of Capra. If fails ... completely and completely. I tried to think of a good thing about it and I can not. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. The angels are actually old cowboys sitting in trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I will not spoil it, but there must be light in the movies if only to contrast with the dark, but there is do not have any. Even the photography is dark - the snow at the end of the frost, everywhere cold, wet and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the movie ends well (schmaltzy). What a relief !
