The original show was so much better. They should have left on a good note. This movie killed the idea. It was boring, dramatic and the fun parts were too far away to make up for the lack. This movie really seemed to be way too hard to be serious, and it was not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention the fact that for a long time it was always depressing about the same thing over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is a little boring, and not so funny either. Sorry. 4/10 stars that's it. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
