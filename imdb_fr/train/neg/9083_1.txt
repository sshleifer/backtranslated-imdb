It was so terrible. It was not fun to watch at all. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, even if it's not fun to watch in this movie. I repeat, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if it was the only part of the movie you watched, just a girl on a couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have released this scene in cinemas, maybe the movie would be nice at a certain level. My advice, move quickly, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could have fun for 2 hours that way. This film ranks alongside my crib on your grave and the Doom generation in the category of the worst films I have ever seen.
