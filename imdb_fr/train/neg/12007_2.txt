It's amazing how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the day of the release. I mean ..... watch the cast here, the promotion is superb, pretty good songs and the trailers are fine. That makes it a full house on the first day, but it's only when people go to see the film that they realize it's impossible for their money to be refundable. Full house on the first day, the film was released next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by "Love Actually", is said to have failed to manage the cast well. They tried to make big stars but ended up not even getting an average performance from anyone. The stories are hollow and old-fashioned, so that the public can not connect to any of them. This is a big disappointment for all those who love big stars or even Nikhil Advani after his great success of "Kal Ho Na Ho".
