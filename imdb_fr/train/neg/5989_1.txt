wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this movie at the cinema. I can not believe I lost my time. The acting is at best worthy of the name and the special effects are raw. Probably the worst scenario in history, extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear god 'swept' is better than that. Madonna should have won and Oscar compared to these guys. I want an hour and a half of my life. Honestly, people do not see it, even toddlers would find that this movie is an insult to their intelligence. I found this film very strange in the fact that it was hard to say who is the most wooden, these guys here are real puppets. If the guys do not waste your time on this movie, you will regret it.
