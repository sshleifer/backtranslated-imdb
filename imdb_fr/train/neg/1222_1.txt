It's a seriously disturbed movie. Even if the boys deserved some of what they had ..... the gruesome sadistic executions were "slightly" excessive. The only conscious character at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could help with the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be a promise of a mediocre affair, but it was just a ploy to drown the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was going arrive. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the film for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and shouted "and, where is the batman?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> That would have been cool!
