In the unlikely event that some budding directors would read these comments, I'd like to offer some (free!) Tips, from the viewer's point of view. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure movies, go for it. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, if you have killed and beheaded an awkward character of "comic relief" and you follow him with a monkey shaking a tree and placing a coconut on the head of a cannibal, you give the impression that you do not have no idea what kind of movie you want to do. This one is boring, winding, cheap, racist ... you get the picture. Some smart moments and some glimpses of Kathy Shower's nudity (far too pretentious here) are not worth it. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
