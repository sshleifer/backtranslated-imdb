"Nada" is the most inadequate sequel to "The Red Nuns" which, with hindsight, now appears as the last good film of the golden age of Chabrol (1967-1973). "Nada" is Chabrol's first real attempt to make a fully political film. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassador, hostages, a lot of blood, not really Chabrol. "Nada" included political elements, but it was rather a psychological thriller with the usual look on the society of the French provinces. field.A heterogeneous cast gives the film the coup de grace: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are up to it. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("La Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is lost like a lady (Gabrielle). The Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are awful. <br /> <br /> With "Nada", this second period of sterile inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res" before he was at the top of his game again.
