Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> This film gets a 7 out of 10, which must be one of the worst movies I've seen in years. not only was acting incredibly bad, but the scenario (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Of course, everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during this time. This is not the case, however. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of time and certainly a loss of my money. <br /> <br /> and the 2 just to try
