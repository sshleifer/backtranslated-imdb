The only thing that prevented me from throwing up after watching this movie is the fact that it's all about actors and not about the damn show that usually appears on television. This is also the main reason why fans of the TV show will not appreciate the film, but it is not the only one. This film has as much entertainment value as getting a root canal. He approaches the depths of the abyss of a bad film, and then gets worse. I will not waste your time describing this movie in more detail; it suffices to say that I pity the poor camcorders who had to suffer by watching this film the first time.
