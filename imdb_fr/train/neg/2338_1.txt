How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with this other best Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also characters in the Congo Express assembled without really having a relationship: Jean (Congolese), the worker, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. This should not be a reason to excuse the flaws of the script (if there is a script) of Anyway, the wind is blowing. The joke (the only one!) The evening on the ice in the refrigerator is taken from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" in which De Witte puts too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents occur in the film but no explanation is given after. Tom Barman gives us here a film that looks more like an experience to watch on television than a movie for theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
