With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13 and there was a lot of cursing when the mother had Jackass's original boyfriend. There was a lot of character development that made the movie more enjoyable to watch, and after the kid came back to life as a scarecrow, there was a defenseless hour and ten minutes on his part. The violence was excessively excessive and I think the number of people was over twelve, which is a big number for films like this one. Almost all the characters in the film were stabbed or had their heads cut off, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" balaclava, they do not draw in class, they sit there and throw objects at the teacher). The professor deserved a death more horrible than anyone, but he was stabbed in the back. There were two scenes of suspense in the film, but it did not last long enough to scare. As I said, the murders were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with history let themselves be cut off. If the gore was really fun to see, it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body they found in the cornfields, they describe it much more gorier than it actually was, they explained to the policeman that there were worms that crawled in the intestine guys. His stomach was not even cut, so there was no way to have maggots in his stomach, although I would have liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, the characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. I suggest renting this movie for death scenes, I will not see it again soon, but I appreciated the excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the rest, I watched five minutes and I was bored to death, it sounds good but it is not. The original scarecrow actually held me back.
