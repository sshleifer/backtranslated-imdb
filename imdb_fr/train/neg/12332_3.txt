The film looks great on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frenetic lover indulges in a smuggler thriller should be a generic gold crossbreeding, especially with this excellent cast of romcomic. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that Lawrence Kasdan just does not give his two stars a good rope and they will duly hang themselves. The scenario of Adam Brooks is perhaps to blame, but you would expect better from Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda. Instead, the two ping pongs next to each other and the incredible incipient romance are never satisfactorily reconciled with the reason why any of them are the search for France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno co-plays amicably with the policeman with-a-heart and I imagine he wants to be a star with a role. You will notice that he continued doing these remakes (s) of the pink panther so he might have agreed with that ... 3/10
