The championship game is only two days away, but in New Orleans, things are not the way they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses, gambling problems, to a killer on the loose, life stands in the way of what should be a memorable and wonderful moment. Can we put things right and stop a killer before the big game is ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, it's not a movie about football. In reality, football is nothing more than a device for conspiracy and an afterthought. Superdome is rather one of those unhealthy movies for television and populated by Hollywood, and never will be. The casting somnambulates its way through the thing without anyone really handsome. The best (or worst) example is that of Van Johnson in a very small role, which usually tends not to know why he is there. The plot is dull, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a "man" to success? Yes indeed! It's about as credible as the affair she has with David Jansen's soaked liquor. The film also lacks rhythm. Attempting to bring the four or five lines of the film into the film cancels the stream that Superdome could have had. Without drama or suspense in sight, Superdome is a very bad example of a movie made for television in the 70s. The only highlight for me was the voice-over of the late Charlie Jones - a sports host I miss. The eloquent way he exaggerates the plot and exaggerates the atmosphere of New Orleans is pure cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most other people who saw Superdome, I did it with the courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. This is perhaps one of the episodes of KTMA audience, but this is one of the best examples of the beginning of the series. So, even though I only gave Superdome a rating of 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
