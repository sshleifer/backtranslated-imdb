I really wanted to love this movie, but it was impossible. The acting was ultra-martyr, the intriguing plot and slow pace, so slow that I had to find his place. All the while sitting at the theater, I wanted the film to end. Twenty minutes in a movie and I pray for an end. Of course, some of the visuals were nice, but go guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magic instruments, there was not a lot of music to speak of. The music was annoying and boring. There were sometimes loud and shrill sounds, which were also annoying. Mostly, this film managed to bother me and get me out of trouble at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to go to "Tideland" and rinse that bad taste out of my mouth.
