This movie is great. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was ok, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a totally different movie from those awful Hollywood movies, like Matrix and STop or My Mom Will Shoot. It could have been better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like this big heel that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since this Domino Pizza clay guy. This movie not only looks really cool, like those blurry films that my dad did on my birthday when I was 6 years old. But he tells a complex story with dozens of characters who seem completely independent at the end. It's great to see how this web is woven so that everything meets. I wish Ted V. Mikels to do a sequel. But he needs more extraterrestrials. And a pirate.
