I'm 17 and I still love most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love 90s movies and recently we had one of Scooby Doo's best direct DVD releases this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I was not expecting. Anyway, back to get a clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed at all. First, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very standard on Saturday morning - at sunset - usually the worst part of the show. Even some shows that I really hate had a slightly better animation. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens and Fred, Velma and Daphne really missed me, because they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was really good. I also hated character changes, because it seemed to me that instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby now played the role of superheroes, which they would never have done in movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme was not very good either, I do not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and artificial. However, I recognize that there is a very talented selection of voices, if they had better material and were not told to sound as different from the original voices as possible, which they did, allow- me to add. In conclusion, I personally found this horrible and I do not try to discredit him, that's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
