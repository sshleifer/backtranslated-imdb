I wish I could give this film a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after its release, I came on IMDb to check the comments. A commentary called the predictable and nerdy movie with a terrible dialogue. I do not rely on the opinions of others, so I lost seven dollars for this shitty movie. It must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The writer should be pushed to the bottom of the cliff. Since when do horror movies have soft scenes? I swear, I am astonished that there was no group HUG ^ - ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I zoned thinking about my research paper for English. The clich√©, a bird / cat popping out of nowhere, when you thought something was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I nearly died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I have to take my mother's shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Security is a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (which does not match the dress, by the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it off, they take her home, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the movie ENTIER. And not only there, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was "He stole the groom's clothes and he snuck out of the hotel" and "It's the inspector coming in the hallway, not the murderer!" moments. Movies should NEVER be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I will end my speech by saying that it was a terrible film. I'm glad I went to the movies not to buy it at $ 15.00 and hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the murderer would have fallen into the same position where he had been injured. A knife in his hand, falling and stabbing the girl before going down. Oh, how charming it would have been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money. Go see a good movie.
