I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise was interesting. I persevered, although I found the acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, unusual. I was hoping that my time would come to fruition, but in the end I wondered why they had bothered to do this thing. Perhaps in George Orwell's version, there is a message that deserves to be passed on. If this film did something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I can not believe that his story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is "Ordinary life is worth living," well, they succeeded. I would recommend this film to anyone. 101 minutes of my life lost.
