This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's mobilizing mass opera has never been twice wrong, the most discordant and inexplicable case that took place in his fourth season when Junior Soprano was a trial for his life. Rather than continue this captivating (and crucial) plot, the authors instead chose to ignore it completely, focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieri's constant moans about the frozen pasta dish of his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br /> When Notorious aroused keen interest, for example, Tupac Shakur's first mysterious assassination attempt that triggered the entire East Coast-West Coast conflict and eventually led to Tupac's death. and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as an additional plot. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold by his own people? Did he alone maintain his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation from a primitive office drone to a sex-obsessed diva vampish as banal as it looks here? <br /> <br /> None of these issues were frugally tackled by the film's writers, much more interested in portraying Wallace's turbulent love life as a convincingly dramatic success. These sequences (including a group indecrease in a hotel room) are so insane and manipulative that the only real comparison is that of a networked TV movie. <br /> <br /> Narration, both structure and content, is simplistic and banal. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated about the intricacies of their lives and their work; the film is almost completely worthless. The use of the "meat and potato" genre plot, coupled with lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this one is expected to skyrocket), results in a film that seems to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and requirements of these. implicated, leaving to Wallace's dubious status a giant in his field, reserved for those easily persuaded and converted before. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is widely described as akin to a Latter-day Saint, frankly gave me the idea of ​​throwing up. <br /> <br /> On this point, like all the others, Notorious is rude, calculating and compromised.
