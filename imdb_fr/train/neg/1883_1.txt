I did not think it could be done, but something happened and replaced Open House - a low-budget horror about someone who kills because of the high price of real estate - like the worst movie I've ever seen. have never seen in my short but otherwise sweet life. <br /> <br /> It has been touted as the best film of the most recent film festival in Montreal, which leads me to believe that any other entry must consist of blank clichés accompanied by lugubrious poem readers. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie has been like a little slice of hell. He comes from Austria and tries to stumble in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet: scenes of various characters living in a suburb dark belly. There is the big dog owner and his fat housekeeper who striptease, the skinny divorced whose wife still lives with him in a house where is the untouched room of his dead child, the über-annoying hitchhiker who recites the first ten lists ... The list continues. Forever. Quite like the two hours and more that I spent in this theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in an intelligent, interesting or even relevant way. I can not say if they were good as actors, because, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You're so lame!" They certainly did not have to learn much, because everyone repeats his same lines at least three times in a scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a gummo, nor any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover, nor what to linger after, if it is not so if you have to change your policy "never go out during a movie" (what many older couples have done during a random orgy scene - and if it sounds appetizing This is not the case, unless you are one of the few to not find the idea that your parents have sex - and with a few middle-aged local couples, which is shocking). <br /> <br /> This film was offensive to me. Not soft nudity, not the soundtrack inducing squeaks, not shock-free scenes involving guns. I was offended by the fact that someone actually spent money doing this when there are competent writers and filmmakers looking for funding. I was offended that someone from outside the city had been to see Dog Days and wondered if that was what Montrealers could find better. Above all, I was offended by the fact that the people involved in the festival fooled everyone into believing that the Emperor had a fascinating and hypnotizing new outfit when it was painfully obvious that he was also naked that the big housekeeper doing a striptease. <br /> <br />
