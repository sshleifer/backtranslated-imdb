With the exception of sound, none of the critics above is really a criticism for this type of horror film without a (truly) independent budget. Makeup and makeup effects are very good and the main actor is effective. The main actress, although attractive, needs a little coaching because she was particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Frightworld is its length. half an hour too much to be effective as a slasher movie, the plot about 10 minutes out of the top 50 being relevant. <br /> <br /> In some places it's visually appealing and sometimes, the lack of lighting in the movies favor. However, when this is combined with poor sound, as in most movies, it is difficult to watch large sections. <br /> <br /> This could certainly be an entertaining film if you are not original. with a judicious and ruthless edition, in its present form, it behaves like an unfinished sketch.
