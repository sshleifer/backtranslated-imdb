I have never seen any of Spike Lee's previous movies because their trailers never interested me. I saw and admired the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, and several DVDs. However, I was totally disappointed by this movie. If this film demonstrates Spike Lee's abilities as a director, I would advise you to "find a job" and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if other IMDb commentators have watched the same movie I had seen before. I can only assume, from reading their epic reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee blinded them to the banality of this work. I only paid $ 2.50 in a Second Run Theater, and I still felt like I was wasting my money. <br /> <br /> The IMDb "Trivia" page says it all .......... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How can you expect to film a big budget "Blockbuster" (as promised by the hype), in such a short time? No wonder everyone had such a low performance. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard first had to direct the film ..." - He may have done justice to this project, if he had had more time to do it. so of course. Although the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I am sorry! This film was so pitifully clich√©d, with incredible scenes and lousy descriptions that it might not have been able to do much with it. (Hey Ron, do not forget to thank Russell ... Good Call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - And it's been seen! His portrayal of a "fixer", which makes people's problems disappear, was as incredible as the scenario he had been given. Did she even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would bother to show up and let a uniformed police officer know they were robbing the bank, and he'd be better off to stay away ... or? <br /> <br /> * When "Inspector Frazier" (Denzel Washington) arrives at the bank to check that there are still no corpses, how many unarmed burglars would have "led" a cop ( much less "let" a cop) go back to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed to have given the thief "every reason to shoot me". Why, then, in their brief fight, did he not even try to expose the face of the thief? That may have had the answer he was looking for ... a thief would have pulled it just to prevent further identification. And why did it take so long "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the thief's accomplice) to come help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these are not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda and did not want anyone to be hurt. But the cops had no reason to think they would not do it. For them, it was a hopeless situation. Why then, when two of the villains went out to "pick up the pizzas?", Were not they shot. (First of all, how many thieves would have gone out without using a hostage as a shield?) Is this version of Spike Lee NY City or SNL? Slaughtering them would have reduced the number of criminals, botched their plans and the remaining thieves would probably have given up. Otherwise, there would be at least less bad guys inside. (Give something to SWAT, or send it home!) <br /> <br /> * Which police service in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to sneak right into the bank and discuss a case with thieves, that she would not disclose them first? She had no authority, no government title; and besides, it was after all "already" a hostage-taking ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why would not the bank's CEO, (Christopher Plummer), have just destroyed the offending material a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold. <br /> <br /> * Who was this "schmuck" (the character, not the actor), with Jersey accent, who voluntarily volunteered and said he knew the recording was " 100% Albanian ", but he could not say it himself ..... SIR! Put your hand down! And his ex-wife! What "schlump" she was !!! Both were totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * When questioning suspects, why Det. Frazier, continually harass individuals who were clearly not part of the heist? (Ie - tell the older woman that she could go and she could not, so she could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after having seen the burglars demand that the hostages put on a series of jumps, can not deduce that their escape plan includes getting out of the bank pretending to be hostages? <br /> <br /> * Near the end of the movie, a fake wall was built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens had been hiding for "a week" ... where the materials came from of? (drywall and poles) We also had to assume that they were cutting the sewers so he could relieve himself. The bank's employees had not complained about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; since the documents "were" in the hands of the thief, what kind of "references" did Mrs. White expect to obtain from the bank's general manager, knowing that he would now be the target of blackmail, because of his failure? <br /> <br /> * And last but not least, what is Denzel's "Glide Electrique"? SO STUPID! Was this supposed to indicate his "determination" to bring these guys to justice? He looked more like a man who climbed aboard a caddy while trying to prevent stool! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than mediocre plot; ugly script; bad game; and the overall pitiful staging ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will give enough information about the movie to help others decide whether or not they waste their money! <br /> <br />.
