Marie Dressler airs this Depression-era drama on a bank owner, who recently aired on the TCM channel during the April Fools comedy month. If you're expecting big laughs from the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you'll be disappointed because it's really a very dark film. It is also very badly done, surprisingly then because it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's naked cinematography is strictly based on the configuration of the camera and does not move it, often to the detriment of the actors, who end up providing lines off the screen (it's like a panoramic print before scanning! ). ) or having the head cut off. The film does not even have a credited director, which underlies the seemingly fly-in nature of the production. All in all, it is an unsatisfactory disaster, with Dressler often over-emotional and only this strange final deviation to the bathroom to distinguish it.
