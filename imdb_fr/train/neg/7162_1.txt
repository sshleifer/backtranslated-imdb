This film takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified witch of 2000 years and destroys it completely. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who are going to dry in Ireland. They go to his Nan and his uncle. Uncle discovered a 2000 year old witch kept in peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. She can not be killed in a conventional way, (more is pity). Nora, however, finds a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that was made for cheap. It's a sprawling mess. I have to ask why anyone would want to do such a bad movie. I am tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL PRICES
