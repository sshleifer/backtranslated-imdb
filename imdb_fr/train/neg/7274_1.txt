"The National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst film of all time, far less than the inept "Plan 9 of Outer Space". <br /> <br /> The Lampoon movie is told in three segments, each so-called a parody of a conventional film genre, but each landing at our feet with a thud. There is no rhyme or reason for these ugly vignettes, and no discernible stories. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only positives of the film are the nude scenes. Certainly, Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry blink a little flesh, and that's fine too. But filmmakers do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. None of this here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a beaver-hungry young policeman associated with an old cynical agent played by Widmark. And for a moment, those who still watch this obnoxious cinematographic exercise are comforted by the idea that we are about to see a redeeming narrative of how the idealistic young policeman causes a purifying change in the way the old work of police. But no luck. As we said, this film has no redemptive value. It's disgusting to the last fade - which, perversely, stretches longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew they had a problem and wanted to make the most of it.
