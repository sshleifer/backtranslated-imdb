<br /> <br /> Not only do extraterrestrial visitors look exactly like a human woman with shaved hair and not only are extraterrestrial visitors perfectly able to speak English (with an Australian accent), they also called their stars by the same names that our terrestrial astronomers have given! <br /> <br /> And to top it all, all extraterrestrial life knows how we humans are evil, evil, destructive and destructive. And they are quite willing to tell us how bad it is. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, do not do it. Well, unless you have insomnia or if you have a choice, go for this exploratory film or surgery without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film tries to convey a moral and ecological message, but only manages to make you yawn and prays for it to end soon. .
