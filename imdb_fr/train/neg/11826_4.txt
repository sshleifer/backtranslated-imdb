There is something sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something, trying to do something very different ... and ends up being mediocre. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is reasonably well done and made, but the script is bad. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story to a comedy in "Roxanne," but this effort to introduce a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene is right in a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story updated with a little style, prefer to rent "Great Expectations".
