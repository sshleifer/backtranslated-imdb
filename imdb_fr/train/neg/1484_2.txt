please do not rent or even think about buying this movie.They do not even rent it in the red box, which would cost $ 1 and I think it's worth less than that. I rented this movie because Jenna Jameson is in the movie between 2 and 5 minutes.I'll give credit that the movie had hot girls and some nudity, but other than that, you could as well buy another horror movie that has the same thing with Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna and she's not even on the cover of the movie, nor her name. I recommend to people to watch the zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost all through the movie and nude this movie is a big disappointment and such a waste of time.
