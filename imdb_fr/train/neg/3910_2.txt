Isabel Allende's magical and lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family has been vandalized. The resulting heavy film load - largely due to the magnificent cast of Anglo-American actors totally unable to remove the elusive Latin melancholy of Allende's characters and a Scandinavian director's hand - has was so uncomfortable that I went back to the theater a second time to make sure I had not missed something vital that could change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed anything. None of the Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could escape the trap set by director Bille August. All seemed perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, with as little effort as possible, they expected to disappear unnoticed in good times. (Yes, the film was shot within an inch of his life.) Curious that the production designer had the privilege of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that takes place in the 1970s, before the creation from KFC. At the time, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving that, what is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast-food chains did not arrive in South America until the early 1980s. "The House of Spirits" should have been the 1993 film event. Because of its club and loyalty to the vague idea what the novel represents, Miramax had to market it as a film of art. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have filed a complaint for rape.
