Comparing this misery with an old budget porn film would be an insult to the old budget porn movie. Animal scenes are meaningless and do not represent this man and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstraction. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case reads: "Repeat the terror reign of the BTK Killer". This is not a story. A story would suggest that you are told the truth about what happened, how or why. None of these things are true. I'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and I've seen pretty crappy movies about them and honestly, it's not one of them. It's not even about the BTK killer. Save time and a few dollars and rent Dahmer instead. This serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just have to see this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then you will always feel cheated.
