We all know that countless misses have honored the slasher genre of the 80s and often deserve only our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a little fast but damn if "Slaughter High" was not terribly original, even for a slasher movie. The plot involves a child who has experienced a shower humiliation similar to that of Carrie in high school and who returns to the dilapidated building to take revenge on a group of former tyrants who all show up to remember. As you can imagine, on April 1, a masked madman killed them by electrocution, hot, drooling and chemically altered beer. I have a number of problems with the details of the plot and settings of this movie, but considering the end, I feel the need to get rid of my complaints and say that it is a waste of time total. Ignore any thought of watching this movie ...
