I start writing this review during a break while watching the movie. This is the first time I try to do that, but I have a hard time getting through it without a break. It's not because it's intense, but because it's bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when the dying brother of supernatural power, Ryan (Colm Feore) is on screen, tragic and bitchy, complacent and self-indulgent -comparative . It would have been a much better movie if they had just left this character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing but a mawkish, a maudlin, a very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they could not make Ryan credible, they would just make him odious. The problem is: does it matter if a spoiled, wailing and hateful fool dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character has for him is the fact that he is dying, and sorry, but that's not enough. To die does not make anyone special. We are all dying, sooner or later. This does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy by acting like a fool. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and the actors who play them (David Cubitt in the role of Theo and Chandra West in the role of Sarah) are much more interesting, and their story, without the self-pitying interruptions Ryan, would have made a much better movie. But it's not over yet and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe something big is happening before the end .... <br /> <br /> Nope. Sorry. This rented turkey goes back tonight!
