I had never heard of this before the owner of my local DVD rental store told me about it; Being a horror movie of the 1980s with the notorious distinction of being banned in the UK, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to be a dull, amateurish and ugly journey; the sound recording is so mediocre that the dialogue is unintelligible half the time, while the actors play gives a new meaning to the word inept! <br /> <br /> Worse still, the film follows the terribly tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident and being sheltered from a dysfunctional family living in an isolated environment. Soon, one of the girls will seek help and is never heard again; another, still bedridden, is quickly eliminated (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one who interacts most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a mother who crushes the Bible (her horrible excessive gesture), her repressed daughter (who has been suffering for a long time) and her weird brother who sometimes appears the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests. <br /> <br /> Often resorting to table memories from the hating mother (as a means to fill the sadness, not to mention the unprecedented background) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter battles, the film has one more asset - the end of the twist is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it hardly removes the bad taste left by the film in the mouth (as much through the lameness of all this as the intermittent gore) or the inevitable feeling of having lost 80 minutes of my time ...
