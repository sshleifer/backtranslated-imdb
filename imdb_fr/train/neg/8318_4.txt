I've already seen fantastic stories, but the premises of it are so incredible that it's almost ridiculous. A young, wealthy young man suffers a heart transplant the day after his marriage and is a sort of witness to his own surgery and the conspiracy of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, then there is a mix of dialogues between ... say ... souls? ... maybe and the real life where the devoted mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shadow of suspense or thrill, just the combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the film is completely lacking in quality. - The director for the first time, Joby Harold, does a decent job directing a good team of actors, including Hayden Christensen in his first major role after taking the costume of Anakin Skywalker, the fabulous Jessica Alba and the very talented Lena Olin. All would have deserved a better story.
