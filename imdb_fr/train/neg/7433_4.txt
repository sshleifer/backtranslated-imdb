I must be quite honest in saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a complete opinion of the film until I have fully seen it. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from the Finisham maternity hospital. This is where Matron (Hattie Jacques), the main character, works with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also present, including pregnant Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her future nervous husband, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Bill Maynard is also performed by Freddy and Wendy Richard of EastEnders in Miss Willing. This plan does not work, because all the staff gets in the way. That's about all we can say about the movie until I see it all over again. Okay!
