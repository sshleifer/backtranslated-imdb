First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you did not know it already, I think you're a jerk. But suppose none of us are stupid. We all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature, correct. <br /> <br /> We get instead a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that tries to show how animals are. "Human". Filmmakers look up and down images of animals engaged in man-like behavior, and when that happens, they say, "This monkey is almost a human!" (It's actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorizing on what makes dogs "smile", but they do not once mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even show chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I was expecting an insightful documentary about animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals are emoting in their own languages. But instead, researchers continue to retreat on pedantic and anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas", enough to turn my stomach upside down. <br /> <br /> But that does not stop there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in nature but in laboratories and experimental installations. All the shots of chimpanzees are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crammed into their sterile concrete cages. A particularly disturbing moment occurs at the beginning (although you must notice it quickly) where a captive monkey says in sign language: "Want to go out. <br /> <br /> Unclear references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments that I shudder to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and given wire dolls to prove that baby monkeys are thirsty for a "maternal figure". And after 40 years of experiments, insidious researchers welcome their brilliant conclusion: the apes have emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for this purpose. and to this day she remains so. We have a brief overview (still through bars) of his support against a concrete wall with a rather dull expression. Personally, I do not need to see other experimental data. Washoe, I apologize for our entire species.
