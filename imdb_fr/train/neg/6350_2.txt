I've seen my share of Woody Allen's movies, and while they're not always great, you can usually be sure to entertain yourself. The last ones are probably good Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I saw were uneven but observable. And so, when I was invited to see Woody Allen's new film, Melinda and Melinda, which I did not even know was out, I immediately agreed. I had not heard much about it so I hoped to be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got is without a doubt the worst Woody Allen film I've seen. The premise is over-explained, the distribution is terrible, the scenario is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched, I suppose to complete what would otherwise have become a short film of 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The concept behind this film does not bother me at all - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and the film obviously proceeds to show us that, by playing both scenarios. The problem is that neither of these "two films" are good at all. Comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had a good idea but he ran out of gas or time to finish the film. <br /> <br /> The general level of acting is particularly bad too - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it's essentially an impression of Woody Allen. Good actors, like Chloé Sévigny, seem boring, but the worst of all is Radha Mitchell and Melinda (which is a shame because her character is present in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> just for the actors, the script with which they work is lacking, if not nonexistent. Far away from the Allen, we know and love classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
