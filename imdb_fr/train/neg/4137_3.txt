I have a high tolerance level for shit, so I was eager to see that. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, he follows a father and a girl in search of a vampire who, fortunately, is traveling with them. Then we have Santa (or the general, as he likes to be called here) running on random zombies. Did I mention that there was a zombie outbreak? The dead come back to life but no one seems too concerned. We have zombies of construction workers, zombies of soldiers and even zombies of schoolgirls from St-Trin. Apparently, Santa is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Oh, wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in an insane asylum and Carmilla is her nanny, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa Claus is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I love zombies but I particularly like lesbian sex. Nothing like a cunnilingus simulated to run the juice. When will we see vampires fighting zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy lesbian vampire or nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here are the zombies of St.Trinian. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex, more zombies kill and eat vampires. I guess the zombies won or did they? Ground? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
