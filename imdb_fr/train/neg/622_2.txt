This film is so exhilarating. The main character seems to be 35 years old and I saw lean bean stalks with more balls than this guy. The twists of the plot are so predictable that the humor factor does not even deserve to be watched. <br /> <br /> Some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard in 3 years "go get a little animal to torture". Ugh ..... I can not even continue, do not look at this pile of garbage, it was manufactured in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only highlight is the drunk guy calling the main character a fag to draw pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unassailable
