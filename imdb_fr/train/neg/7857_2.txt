Is not someone else tired of this old clich√© 'where an almost dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us information, then blows his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. <br /> <br /> The problem is that its use in this film is worthless. If you have seen the first movie (the first remake, I should say), the information given is worthless, because you would have known them already. I guess you can understand that the main characters are not in vain ... but why then does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Would not he want to live? Of course, he would be dead anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie called "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first being the sequel to the original film of the 70s. This is where it becomes a little complicated for someone like me. You see, I'm probably part of a minority of people my age who even knew there was an HHE2 to start with, let alone an original HHE1. And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly like the sequel to the original HHE1 ... that just makes it worse! But anyway .. <br /> <br /> The origin of Wes Craven's Hills Have Eyes was ok. In the end, the idea was better than the presentation, but he probably had a reduced budget. To be quite honest, Wes Craven is not very good for a horror director. He only made some good horror movies (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good (Scream) and some horrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, and he's also created Swamp Thing ... but the original HHE2 is in this last category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he co-wrote the new HHE2..and it's a disappointment! HHE's remake of last year was even better than the original movie. It was tense. I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, not a bunch of beer, pot and sex, crazy teenagers. It made us feel dirty. During the first hour, we were in hell and, in the last few minutes, the good guys took revenge on the bad guys and it was good for them. <br /> <br /> This new film is without tension. No suspense whatsoever. Just violent things that happen to most stupid people. There is almost no threatening presence here. Ugly hobos hidden under rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm getting sick of horror movies where people are dying because of the stupid mistakes they make. Just the other day I watched "Deep Blue Sea," where Samuel L. Jackson continued to walk around the water while delivering the speech, then was eaten by a shark, only because the idiot stayed too close to the water ... something that nobody would do in the given situation! Here is exactly the same thing. People leave alone to escape, even if they know that people are dying. Seriously, could a pause in the pot not wait? And then, when we think that people would have learned, someone else goes away alone! Seriously, is not it more scary when the characters bring their first game and lose again? I think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even less effective. The first remake should have looked like "The Fog" (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). No more bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything. <br /> <br /> But it really degrades. Fewer bad guys. No tension. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but there is not much going on there. In the end, it seems like there are two or three bad guys. The last film gave the appearance of a tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who continues to watch them through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things this film should have brought us, but it ends with exactly the same promise that we had in the last film, with exactly the same scene "to be watched". Come on! I will give the devil it's due. The look of the movie is good..but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not even think gore fans will appreciate that ... although I'm probably wrong! There is gore (although most of it is accelerated in the dark), but without the tension and the characters you care about ... the gore does nothing in my book! In the end, you are not scared. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8 year old girl). You do not even feel like you've seen anything new.
