In reviewing this film, I can only rely on my weekend warrior experiences doing my basic training in July, August and September 1971 in this garden of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not at all what I remembered from my basic training. <br /> <br /> But it must be remembered that at the time, it was post-Korea that ended in a stalemate, but it was a classic war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a guerrilla war in the jungle where we continued to pour recruits into an endless chasm. The project at that time was an unwelcome project but accepted as always necessary for the defense of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea who has been instructed by the state to train troops overseas. The film talks about one of his training cycles and the men of the peloton he has to train. This is the usual genre found in almost all war films of the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will be praising at Take The High Ground is the fact that the MGM has recognized that our army is now integrated, with the presence of William Hazard as a black rookie in the pack . It corresponded to the spirit of the times that were changing. <br /> <br /> But I will say that a rookie like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from the first day. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or eunuch status to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have worried him so much about Robert Arthur giving up. He just let the members look after him. <br /> <br /> Of course, the gunshots at Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas, gave Take the High Ground a great deal of authenticity. But consider it a recruiting film in the military and you will certainly understand why the government so willingly cooperated in the day. <br /> <br /> I remember that the NCOs had their little conflicts that you did not fear they reproach you for in 95% of the cases. But it is not impossible that Karl Malden brought Widmark into the open during a training session in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have understood that it would have undermined the authority, which the army does not let happen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say something better about Take The High Ground, because I like his talented cast, it's the talented director Richard Brooks, and even the silly theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar the year before for High Noon. The film has also been nominated for the Oscars for Best Screenplay and Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.
