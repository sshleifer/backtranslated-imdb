This film should never have been done. <br /> <br /> What a shame for the budget. <br /> <br /> Engage compelling actors and make a quality film. Very fine ground and unconvincing lines. It's almost hilarious, and it's a shame for an action movie .... <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They continue to replay the same "shots" of a stealth plane one way. You have already seen one and it was not worth repeating 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from the cinema. <br /> <br /> His movies are getting worse and worse every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
