A singularly unusual musical that artificially attempts to marry the explosion of rock'n'roll in the vanguard with the bourgeois sensibility of a suburban sitcom. The result is a discordant mishmash that will not satisfy any of the spectators who left for the music, but at least will leave their parents satiated. <br /> <br /> A quick glance at the writing of the promo on the site The back of the video should give an idea of ​​the content. Tom Ewell is a drunken agent, too played with so little comedic talent that you almost expect him to shout "Hi honey, I'm home!" The introductory text places it as "So funny in" The 7 Year Itch "". It almost sounds like an excuse. What other movie would sell on the fact that a leading actor was good at something else? It reads: "So funny in" The 7 Year Itch "... but it is zero in that". <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with supposed assets of 50 inches, is unfortunately a cheap Monroe basement with all the acting abilities and comic timing of a rotting haddock. Its wooden delivery combined with Owell's dual OTT plugs make it a comic partnership of hell. The sale gives us: "[Jayne Mansfield] whose most obvious talents are behind many of the biggest laughs in the film!" As you can see, a movie sold on the idea that he has a big chest is not the most sophisticated thing. Most of this "humor" is about men literally falling on their toes, their cute glasses on the Mansfield site, and so on. Only the Freudian nightmare of an overflowing milk bottle casts doubt on his "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> For On the musical side, the most adenine are chosen. Do you really want Eddie Fontaine to say, "I like your eyes, I like your lips, they taste even better than potato chips" in a song called "Cool It, Baby"? Only the arsonist, Little Richard, comes out of the MOR, but is forced to sing some of his friendliest songs with his father in a four-minute sequence. And how is it that all bands sing without a single microphone? The satire attempts on the industry are vast and childish in their design. <br /> <br /> Technically, the photo was quite advanced, with special effects (including a ghost like Julie London) and a luxury color (which now looks flat and clear). In fact, with its bleeding reds and fake skin tones, it looks like a colored film). However, the steering is not remarkable and the sound quality is also very poor. <br /> <br /> It may be so old. At a time when men were still smoking on the screen, disgustingly naughty children made adult remarks, and black servants only cooked and danced. (All that happens here). Yet some like it hot, The African Queen, Ben Hur and many more are examples of movies of the time that can still be seen today. The "good time" argument does not really hold. In her heart, The girl can not help her is a cynical and condescending enterprise that does not stand up to scrutiny. 4/10. <br /> <br />
