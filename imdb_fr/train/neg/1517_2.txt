In the title, I write that the story is ridiculous. below, I will clarify and explain why, in my humble opinion, ruin this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and the Danes do their job, and even if they are not their best job, that's fine. The rest of the cast, however, does a really mediocre job. Note that this is not entirely the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and the Danes are the only ones to have characters who have any place in the film to really give depth. All other characters have too little space in the film to create a depth, or the character is so cliche that it does not matter how hard the actors are. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit complex Se7en, but just looking at the direction, I think he does a job OK. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad scenario. The characters are shallow (except those of Gere and Danes), the bad guys are clich√©s and the actions of the characters are totally incredible. In addition to that, writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years. It's the kind of film that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of whether they paid the price society gave them. It's also the kind of movie that says, even between the lines, that any form of sexual deviance should be punished without a trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, all that is not sexual in the missionary position of a married couple is sexual deviance. <br /> <br /> So if you go to film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you write scripts yourself and want to improve your ego. See it For all the others, I recommend another movie.
