It's by far Jane Eyre's worst adaptation I've seen. It is uncertain that the author of the script has ever read Bronte's book. George C. Scott is ridiculous and stammers like Rochester - when he's not just acting to act angry. Susannah York has the oldest 1970s hairstyle I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly speak, so that the rich joke enjoyed by this book, which is the basis of their deep and constant intellectual love, has disappeared. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent Timothy Dalton's version instead. It's so true to the book, it's like reading the novel out loud. Dalton is superb like Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.
