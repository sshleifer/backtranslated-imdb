This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I can not say how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself many times through this atrocious experience, just so the pain would end. I recommend instead of seeing this movie, you bathe in acid, then you will know at least a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had such expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when at the beginning he added that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... so in the end I wanted to kill me. I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! The monkeys could have done a better job by editing this basket. At least they would have thrown the stool and scrambled some of the garbage. It would have been better not to have seen the horror. <br /> <br /> It's not that I did not understand the jokes, it's that they are not just funny, they repeated twenty. time. Apparently, something is not funny unless you see it a million times. <br /> <br /> Never see him. People have classified "Manos in the hands of fate" as the worst film in the world. I saw it too and I agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is only the second. "Fatty Drives the Bus" is by far worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves all kind of hard language, but I can not write this here, so imagine I swore a whole bunch.
