The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the most thoughtful small budget exploitation movies of the early 1960s. It's very hard to imagine how a scenario of this sexist repellent could have been written without intent to parody. And the themes that are repeatedly repeated by leading actress, Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines, IVs and tongs - seem to confirm that the film was intended to simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes . Helena shades underestimated. <br /> <br /> Gender equality is plentiful and as irritating as an army of ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and incredible, and the acting is just right (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thoughts clearly went there. I'm really not sure what the movie really was about to argue, but it seems obvious that it's yearning for some kind of unusually raw and raw horror (without the blood and bowels expected by today's audience). hui). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly nice. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the beginning. The American pop sexuality of the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman kept alive despite her body gone after what should have been a deadly car accident. Her lover threatens to sew a fresh body of high quality and force her to continue living with him. It is understandable that she is not spoiled by all this and forced to befriend a creature almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also vague references to the 50s / 60s clich√© about the ills of science. <br /> <br /> Recommended for science fiction fans and graduate students in gender studies. O / w not recommended.
