Or maybe it's like that. Anyway, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a carpet, as sweet as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as smart as the three handsets. <br /> <br /> Okay, plot a word (fitted boat, that ...): a doctor (Moss) gets stung by a bat while searching a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and then turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat, but a bat - like a creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims from a first-person camera point of view But there is also the case of the sheriff (Pataki), who speaks of the worst type of sheriff: the guy hick. He harasses people, he scrutinizes married women, he steals handkerchiefs in haberdashery (the FIEND!), He smokes with one of these cigarettes in his mouth and speaks at the same time, which gives him the air and the sound from Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" and (this is the worst part) ... THIS IS THE BEST SUITABILITY OF THE TOTAL FILM! <br /> <br /> The entire movie, however, is just a weekly tele-of-the-crapola movie (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, to shout loudly! What were you waiting for, are these things of Oscar caliber? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? <br /> <br /> And why not ... no stars for "The Bat People", full version OR version MST3K! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there is a sequel to this movie, I will bury my TV.
