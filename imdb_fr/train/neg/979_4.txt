Anyone with a distant interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to start on, which is good, but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, offers much better choices than these series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It remains one of the most important films, but the most forgotten, but the impact of its frame becomes more and more real as the days go by. Charlton Heston over-dramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his last role, makes the most of SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A great leader of the Soylent company is murdered and the police detective Thorn is aware. <br /> <br /> The secret of soylent green is no mystery if you research the film. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole scenario is a joke. It's as cheap as any production. The script and dramaturgy of the actors made the film, but were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a fool and no one knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorn who just loves to waltz in people's flats, unscrupulous and steal whatever he wants. The character's interactions hold your attention on the film, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN is nil. A nice piece if you have the time, but do not wait for anything more.
