The screenwriter / director of this film obviously knows nothing about cinema. I think the DP of this project was tied up and replaced by a monkey because each view was too dark or had warmer areas than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was awful, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone to say that this movie was designed for poker fans and not for movie buffs, someone makes fun of themselves (it was probably the author / director). No poker fan in the world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Going to a casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your day job. And if you play poker, you must be hurt.
