It's not that a film by Ulli Lommel fills me with hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER has managed to sink below my lowest expectations. Young filmmakers have recently tended to use digital video for their first projects, which is very helpful in giving these children the opportunity to create works without spending all their money in expensive movies. But many of these young filmmakers also became aware of the idea of ​​filtering the finished film so that it looks more like a celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mock-up" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. This is the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie is like watching a serial of the day about a murderer. It's not like watching a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that it is almost impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) In video. For God's sake, this guy has been running since the sixties! He may be the only director who has not improved during a forty-year career in the company. And we are lucky, he also wrote the script! So you can expect complicated, meaningless actions, unjustified behavior and at least a truly pretentious plot element that will leave you completely unsatisfied. Please, miss this movie. You'll thank me later.
