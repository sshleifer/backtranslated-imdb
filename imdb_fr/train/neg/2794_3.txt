Well, because I'm a musician, I thought maybe I could watch this movie on TMC, nothing good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half done. I seriously thought it was one of those soft-hearted films with a miserable storyline and plot, miserable filming, and miserable effects. But no, I do not even have the pleasure of that. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for some laughter, but I did not know if they were trying to try it or not. But now I have to stay here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I'm sitting here typing until I have 10 lines
