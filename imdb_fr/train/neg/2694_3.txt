warning: it contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the lemma above. The second scene is the center of rotation of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the film boring. In addition, other intrigues are revealed as the story repeats itself several times. And it made me even more frustrated. To compensate for the lack of suspense that ensues, we learn more and more about the imbalance of the characters. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is an addict, more ?, He cheats on his wife, more ?, He plans to rob his father, more ?, His wife cheats with his brother, more ?, He does not regret his complicity at the death of his mother, plus ?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he could have a higher job. And why his wife had not left him before. On the other hand, I really appreciate the performances of actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH records what's left of my $ 7 spent on this nonsense. Why absurdity? Because it does not make sense, why should I take care of ignoble characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a nice character (at least nice). <br /> <br /> It is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we are supposed to take care of the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the life of the parents before the crime.
