Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would like to see. I did not like the film either when an Australian man smuggled drugs into Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug trafficking. I would not go to this country, whatever happens after watching this movie. In fact, this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I would also prefer to stay in the United States. After seeing part of the film in the cinema, including the false accusation of drug trafficking, I left the cinema and my money was refunded to me because I could not support this film. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who might be a drug smuggler, forget about it!
