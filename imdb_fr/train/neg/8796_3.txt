Average viewers looking for any internal consistency in a movie should probably let this one through. This creates the same feeling as looking at a curious set of individual images that seem to relate to each other, but never merge into a totality. <br /> <br /> This insulating approach makes it possible to create a kind of cinematographic montage. This may appeal to some students or critics imbued with the inner language of current cinema, it is downright irritating and condescending for us, ordinary citizens, who have just fallen from the hay. Authors such as Karwai Wong and Tarantino may have intentionally chosen to prevent accessibility from being aware of accessibility, but to me that seems to be the case when Andy Warhol warmed up. The only feature that redeems me that I find is in the production values, and they just will not cut everything by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought capable of supporting all the remarkable scenes and beautiful. Sorry. Calligraphic credits begin to roll unexpectedly as your interest begins to stir. I get the same big yawn and the same disappointment by reading what I suppose to be very well informed and in-depth comments on this film that never lead to anything really understandable. Ideas and images without external context are not my idea of ​​pleasure. <br /> <br /> Call me a philistine wandering the streets of Hong Kong in search of a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
