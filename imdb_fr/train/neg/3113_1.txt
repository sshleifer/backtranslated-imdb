This film is a mess. I'm surprised there's even a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams, he would have gone straight to the video. It's badly written. It's badly managed. The worst offense is that he took an interesting subject and reduced it to a ridiculous thriller and BORING that has no thrills, no suspense or inner or emotional logic. who are so much above the public that the audience with whom I saw him laughed. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it is not disturbing and there are no chills - in fact, the real offense of the movie is that it is just boring.
