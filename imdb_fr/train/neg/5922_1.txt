My mother keeps a tape of this film as a general threat to anyone who loves the film that irritates her. All that stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? If you inadvertently watched a good movie and accidentally voted for it? <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in the making of the film should be obliged to watch at least a small part of this film. This should be an indelible stain in the mind of all who consider the film as sacred and be revered as the mark of the dramatic film's tide.
