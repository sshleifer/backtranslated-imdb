This had great intellectual pretensions. The main principal intends to give a "deep" "significant" rendering (with a voiceover for his frames of mind of course) and he was certainly influenced by the "method" of the 1950s / 60s, to which the script and direction were worth giving amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters) .But here the story is catastrophic.In addition, it moves too slowly, you can change at least 20 minutes, including the unnecessary flashbacks, and the line of intrigue would not be Sometimes, it is very unlikely that Bruce Dern believes in his character of "uncle" and his portrait often looks like parody. An interesting side is just fly over: the young boy / hero relationship - if we admit that the hero is himself a kind of child- When he tells the young child that he would not let anyone hurt him, a welcome tenderness emerges. But it is missed and only the final scene returns to it. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Take Foley "at close range" instead: he has two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an offbeat movie, but striking, full of suspense.Here, my mating counter is sadly pointing to zero.
