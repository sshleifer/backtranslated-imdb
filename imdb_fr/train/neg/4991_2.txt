One of the worst movies I saw working with a shoddy camera, using a shit filter, the film was gritty, the script was horrible, I mean, the predictability of the big battle to the end was ..... <br /> <br /> some fight scenes were ok I suppose .... <br /> <br /> some scenes were so bad it was comical ... like Sorbo who rides the horse and climbs to the end ... LOL I mean really .. a horse? Oh, I can not forget how bad killers roll in the same vehicle throughout the movie ... you'd think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they would be tracked down ... ETC, ETC, do not bother to really watch it ..
