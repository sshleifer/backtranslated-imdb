Unless you understand the miserable excesses, this movie will not make much sense to you. We tried to mix a bit of humanity with a cold, dreary period of alcohol and drugs - it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak plays her big disco number, her voice is so obvious nicknamed it's pathetic - the producers would at least have someone who rang the bell like her. <br /> <br /> The documentary broadcast on television lately is far superior and gives a much more faithful picture of this period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, can be accused of acting; However, he does an incredible job.
