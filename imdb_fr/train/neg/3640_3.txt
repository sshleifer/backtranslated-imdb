I did not have any basic knowledge of this movie before buying it, but it sounded good and I wanted to see a really awesome movie for the Viking for a while ... alas, this movie was not what I was looking for . I had hoped for the best, but instead, I received a boring Nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on for too long despite its 84-minute duration. The premise of the film is quite fascinating: it is a Viking warlord who defies his god and Odin is so enraged that he curses the son of the warlord, named Barek, until death and rebirth as a Berserker. This type of Barek is then forced to live life after life, enraged, crazy and violent. The film is filmed with enough skill, with a rich cinematography and almost excellent performance from the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning about the end of this dribble. The filmmakers had the chance to create something quite entertaining and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it could have been improved with inexpensive operating tactics, such as free nudity and a lot of coolness ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, are not they? The Vikings were supposed to be pretty bad, but with all the rapes and looting, are not the Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or yourself, in fact, a crazy Berserker who likes to torture himself, I'd probably walk away from this piece of celluloid dull.
