I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with a producer "on camera" extremely irritating and dramatic). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was staged, I wondered why I would lose. my time watching this junk ?? "Then I turned it off and came online to warn others.The characters do not act credibly.too immature emotion.for a man who has traveled half the world in a war-torn country he acted like a kid, and I do not think it was because "his character was so upset by the bomb attacks on the malls." <br /> <br /> very banal and stupid. Have you seen "Lost City Kids" - a fantastic and dark French movie about a guy kidnapping kids and stealing their dreams ... I liked it!
