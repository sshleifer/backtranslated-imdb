I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name from the title, but maybe he should not have worried about it. As mentioned by another speaker, there is not really enough horror or eroticism to attract fans of either genre. The plot is incoherent, Sade's footage is free and most actors are mediocre. Englund was doing his best with weak materials, and Zoe Trilling has a very good background, but nothing is enough to make this film. This one is a cassette. Grade: F
