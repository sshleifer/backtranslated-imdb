Without an effective indulgence of supernatural or poetic nuances of humanity, this whole creative team must hope to be an effective use of its mediocre and non-original elements. 'Party of Five' becomes manic, then genetically inescapable, arouses little interest, because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate mopester 'Wes Bentley' with dull and terrifying behavior. In fact, all actors act in depth. Even if black-haired women appeal, saliency is reduced to a minimum. No nudity here. It also lacks enough buckets of blood. All feelings are kept at a distance, safely ... a regrettable fact given the name given to the directors, it is "butcher". Only the soundtrack, the buzz and the altitude of the country and the fluctuating tense partition offer a palpable tension. Sometimes, some static storyboarding compositions add attractive low angles that add to the discomfort ... but for a movie called horror, I did not even get close to it once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood sampling, oriented scenes with different geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on the game through the malice of the family or the pitfalls that the friendly characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion but it was not a good start for my excursion through the horrorfest.
