Although the film may have been "faithful" to Lewis' book (in that the script was basically word for word), it did not capture any of the magnitudes that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * attracted * and, as in the previous comment, the green screen flight sequence was very difficult to swallow. I almost died laughing when I saw the humanoid beaver with their stiff stiff suits and their prominent teeth; I almost cried when I heard the "scream" of the wolf, a man dressed in a gray and frizzy suit who was screaming as loud and as young as he could. <br /> <br /> All the staging is extremely forced, especially that of the little Lucy Penvensie ... I could not bear that much indignation, despair and fangs in fourteen hours (which seemed to be like) to watch the movie. The actress who plays the white witch, in all her adventures, seems to be more comfortable at home, on a stage where a resounding voice, arms outstretched and a valiant effort for something that Shakespearian would be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> The sets are claustrophobic, whether scenes take place inside or outside. Inside, it's as if the BBC could afford to spend only $ 100 to build a set. So it's very small and all the characters are constantly piled up. The White Witch Castle is an English castle in ruins, covered with statues of polystyrene and poor lighting. When the children of Penvensie wander in the woods - in fact, any scene in the woods - has the impression of wandering around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC has probably ruined the entire budget of the film dedicated to the construction of the mechanical feline. It looks great when he's still and before he starts talking, but once it starts to move, you can not help but complain about the poor man who must be the back of the lion's suit . <br /> <br /> Yes, if you're a hardcore fan of Narnia, you might want to see this version, simply because it keeps all the words that Lewis has ever written - but Lewis was definitely not a screenwriter, and a lot of the dialogue is chunky and awkward on the screen. During the scene in which the children are at the beaver and are preparing to flee the wolves, Ms. Beaver keeps saying, "Oh, one more thing, stay deaf and we'll be ready to leave," punctuated by the simultaneous crying children and sighs and moans of "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!" - a scene of comical relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be SMOKING of all imminent danger, without wondering whether or not to pack the sewing machine), diminishes the drama that the scene might have otherwise. In fact, the whole film is strewn with missteps like these. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, perfect synchronization, and a gorgeous white witch thief of scenes (who plays his part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a screaming banshee ), all capture the grandeur and magnificence of the world of Narnia without hurting in the least Lewis's original vision (I think). Lucy is much more cute (no male teeth, YAY!), Like beavers (and realistic size), and raw, BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, desperately hungry for acceptance, insecurity and the anxiety with an inferiority-complex Edmund that the new version of Disney puts forward. <br /> <br /> Unless you're one to like wasting time making fun of camper movies, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
