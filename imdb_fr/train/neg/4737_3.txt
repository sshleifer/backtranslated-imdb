I loved the first movie "Azumi". I saw Ms. Ueto in several of her appearances on television and saw a lot of samurai and ninja movies. I must say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast of the film and its installation in "Azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this film. but instead, he was slow, walking in places, and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing wood acts. <br /> <br /> When they bothered to refer to the first film, they did it in a rather loose and weak way. In "Azumi", the main character is the best of a group of senior killers. In "Azumi 2", it seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it was a total loss. There were some decent fight scenes and some extravagant characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers overall simply because Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two have really captured the feeling of "manga" in their scenario while the first has never quite "understood".
