This false trip never matches the spirit and madness of the excellent adventure these guys had in their first film. This article tries to move away from its previous one to capture new blood in the joke, but it takes a bad turn and trips away from the guys doing a rock concert (and a lot of people watching "free TV" - since when does this happen?) The writer might have done something more creative; Watch how all the random elements of the first film were perfectly assembled by a convergent element during the scientific presentation. Not in this movie, which virtually ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly done and lacks spark for participation in the comedy or audience. There is a ZZ Top print, hammered for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fictitious thing.
