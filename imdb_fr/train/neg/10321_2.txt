This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and only get worse. I'm one of those who has never been a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at first, until season 2 starts to get horny, all the jokes were played and the characters have nothing to do. At least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is usually a bland comedy on CBC that had nothing to envy to episode 1. Who are the ones watching this show anyway, I'm honest, c 'is old? or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they are working on them? I do not know a single person who loves this show and can not stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully this will not last long because all the success of this show seems to me entirely based on the idea that this show is Muslim, which is different and could / should have resulted in an excellent show.
