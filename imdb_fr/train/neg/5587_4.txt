In addition to his series "Tarzan", the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs has written many other books, though, apart from the popular "At the Heart of the Earth", few of them have been filmed. The novel entitled "The Boy and the Lion", presented on screen under the title "The Lion Man" (1936), is a film too talkative, static, old hat, slow and rather boring, even if it was turned on real desert places. In fact, "film" is not the right word. The story does not move but moves at a brisk pace in a series of abrupt jerks. For example, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then simply disappear. What is even more frustrating for film fans is the characters who make an impression (like the girl who handles Hall with drugged wine) but who are played by players who are not credited! The credited thespians are generally worse off than the strangers. The Australian actress Finis Barton, who makes a good story of the kidnapped young harem who saved the young Master Fairy, is an exception. Certainly, most of the actors are grappling with an atrocious dialogue with King James who must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this garbage is ironic, a ploy that does not seem to have been imagined by any of the film's players who have no talent. Maybe the director J.P. McCarthy has escaped this idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the beautiful Kathleen Burke forced to exchange links with artists like Richard Carlyle (his father) and Jon Hall (his suitor). Admittedly, Mr. Hall speaks with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlyle, but it is not a recommendation.
