The problem with the book "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces but under the surfaces it was the way of thinking of the American man. Reading the book is like watching a beautiful ballet with good music, sets and costumes already performed by backyard animals dressed in these costumes - so far from Japanese thought were the characters. <br /> <br /> The film isn Not about Japan or the real geisha. It is a story about the misconceptions of some American men about Japan and the geisha filtered by their own ignorance and misconceptions. So, what is this film if it's not Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as many people have said? Yes, but why make an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> Missed opportunities have been so many. Imagine a culture where there is no puritanical blockage, no sin connotation about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex treated in this movie? Right. As if it was dirty. In the film, Sayuri wrinkled his nose and winced in disgust for five seconds, as if the man trying to mount it had dropped a handful of cockroaches on his crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really like sex in this movie? Nope. One of the characters is said to be too mocking, but all we see is that she is pushing her lover away, because it seems she does not want to be caught doing something dirty. Such American puritanism has no place in a film about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first delight with an old nursery after the auction of her cherry? Nope. It is spread like a plate of cold meat on a block. Of course, she is not supposed to enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why could not they give him something to appreciate? Why should all the sex be sinful and at fault? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha, the president was Sayuri's secret protector and, as such, he was responsible for the auction of his virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won it himself. Nobu did not even bid. So, why did the president let this old codger win it and, with the smell of an old man, grab his whole naked body? Could a woman really forgive a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to make sense of that. Being behind Mameha, the president has incurred debts for Sayuri geisha training. In order to recover his debts, the president made Sayuri sell to Mr. Crab. Through Mameha, the president sold Sayuri's sexual favors to this old lady so that the president could make an income. The president was not his boss. He was his pimp! A romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is beautiful, but it looks like the beauty of a very attractive and attractive transvestite whose voice, appearance and touch are thrilling. But under this very feminine surface lies a disturbing secret. Under the Japanese surface of the film that appears incorrectly, lies the disturbing secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are entirely American and male. This is not the best thing to do if you are trying to be anything but a lie, a distortion and a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Sophisticated and elegant simplicity. MOAG style ?? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Swept hair. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair that must have been swallowed up in the thick white make-up paste. <br /> <br /> Japanese shaved ice - The Japanese are rather strict in terms of seasonal observances. Crushed ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG crushed ice - The president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri performed by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this treatment during the cherry blossom season. This thought made my whole body shudder with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and qualified facilitators. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese chime - Used in summer because, because of the sound it produces, thanks to the breeze, the Japanese feel a little colder. Wind chime MOAG - a bell! If someone stood in front of someone else's house and made a noise with a wind chime, they would be considered crazy and would not be allowed to enter. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on human relations, group oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is mine" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Traditional Japanese dance ?? Elegance refined. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. Dance dance ?? Martha Graham freaked on LSD while wearing a white Japanese funeral shroud not very very auspicious. Played by a geisha on a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Hahaha! Is a strip club in which they did most of their research on geisha? <br /> <br /> A fire in the Japanese home ?? Establishing or even letting a fire go is worse than murder because it is such a serious threat to the community. Fires can ravage these villages, cities and towns made of wood, destroying hundreds or even thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire - Excellent complement to a fight scene but there is no branching and as it is no longer necessary, the uncontrolled fire miraculously shifts away. Technically, the film ended here because Sayuri would at least have been ostracized and would have joined her sister among those who would never have heard of it again. This is where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film stinks.
