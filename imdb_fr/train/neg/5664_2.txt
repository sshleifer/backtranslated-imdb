I liked Boyle's performance, but that's pretty much the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke as you would like if your 9-year-old nephew spoke if he claimed to be a jaded, stone-hearted policeman or an ultra-bad villain. The hoarse voices seemed amateurish to me. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and improve the opening music. And what about all the police torture cases of 1984? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the real events of the story. In fact, Cox added a lot of things that he apparently thought were really cool, but had nothing to do with history. This is a big disappointment, because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so successful is its minimalism - they are closely related, with no superfluous details. This film is the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot questions the Yidische Zaitung guy or so. I wasted $ 4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction writing this article and hoping to save others from the same mistake.
