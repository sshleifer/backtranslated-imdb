Not a hit on Korman because he was very funny about Carol Burnett's show. He was also good at playing minor characters in Mel Brooks' films ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). He is not, however, a person capable of carrying a film in dueling roles, no less. This one is basically an imitation "Gremlins", following a tradition of movies such as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". This is not a very good imitation either, tied with "Ghoulies", but with a much clearer tone because it is not as dark as this film had. In fact, this one is too light and too sparkling and, unfortunately, many jokes end up falling flat. Although I gave it a 3 for a score, it's only because there is a movie that is even worse "imitation of Gremlin". If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about: the famous "Hobgoblins". This one has a guy who finds a little creature in an underground place (I only saw this movie once a long time ago, so I do not remember too clearly) and the beginning is quite friendly. However, this creature quickly becomes unpleasant and of course, others are engendered and that's the movie. There are more failures than blows in the joke section, and it is also very lame to see Korman play the role of the bad brother. The best is to skip this one, but you might want to take a look at it.
