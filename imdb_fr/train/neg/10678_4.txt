This film looked good - good distribution, subject always green and explosive opening. He came down from there. Why was it filmed by hand? He shakes, judges, a part captures scenes and simply defies the viewer. A bad choice indeed. As if that were not enough, the worst editing in memory requires an addictive visualizer - mandatory if you want to take full advantage of it. And then, he commits the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer to all sorts of improbable and improbable scenarios until exhaustion, they throw credits without revealing the denouement - the end - the gain - as what the heck was the motive? How can you hope to succeed by performing endless thrillers? Doh! This film was very promising and ended up making a face plant in the mud. What a loss of effort. Wrong effort of the writer and the director.
