With the resounding success of "The Army of God", every Mormon with a camera now seems to be trying to make a movie. In the case of "The other side of the sky", it was not a bad thing. This movie, although not great, was pretty good. "The Ward Singles", however, is not. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a divorced young Mormon returned to single life, the writing and filming style of "The Singles Ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the 80's comedy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". However, the similarities stop there. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original and well played (as far as silly comedies like this are), "The Singles Ward" is completely the opposite. He tries very hard to be funny. However, 90% of gags fall flat or are clich√©s and jokes that you have probably heard a million times before. The remaining 10% seems to have been thrown away to fill the allotted time. And the acting, although not terrible, is at best amaturish. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are not Mormon yourself, or if you are VERY familiar with Mormon culture, you will get almost nothing at all. While "The Army of God" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appealed to a wide range of audiences, both inside and outside the Mormon Church, this film is certainly a big hit joke inside, and even if you get it, not so funny.
