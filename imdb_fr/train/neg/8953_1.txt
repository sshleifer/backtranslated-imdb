I saw this film literally right after I finished the book, and maybe it was a neutral or very stupid idea. I think it was the last one. First, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was Winston's daily life in his work, his conversations, his meals in the cafeteria, and so on. He feels free to look unhappy and cast a suggestive look on people without extreme fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities, it was almost impossible to safely show even a hint of his real emotions on his face at any time. This is also shown in scenes in the streets of proletarianism. In the book, Winston knew it was a huge risk to walk around and was skeptical and scared on every trip. In the film, he does it so often and without fear that you lose the important feeling of heavy monitoring and you run the risk of losing control. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies include the fact that Winston hid his newspaper in the wall, yes a very small change, but that begs the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director could do with a book is the transformation of characters. <br /> <br /> The big inaccuracies were however more worrying. First of all, one of the important elements of this book is that Big Brother is a government based on a philosophy that is both intelligent and rudimentary. In the movie, they skip that and go straight to make you believe that the government is led by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when you run it with its facism, but if that's all you get from Big Brother, you really missed the purpose of the book. What is terrifying about Big Brother is that, in a way, his philosophy is based on a few things. When O'Brien chooses Winston at the Ministry of Love, he listens to everything Winston says about Big Brother. The fact that he listens and advances in his philosophy is indeed what is most scary and intriguing. In the end (watch out for SPOILER) when Winston says he likes Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you do not know exactly whether it's the violence or the torture that caused this, or the real power that this philosophy. I do not say in any way that the philosophy of Big Brother has points that I like, but that its intelligence and depth are what makes this book incredibly unsettling. <br /> <br /> In addition, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was horrible, no connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before giving his address to Winston? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons' thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. <br /> <br /> But that's about all that explains why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible not to jump the gun and transform the characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think that this film was watchable if it was less than two hours? At a minimum, the film takes 3 hours to capture some of the moods and important relationships. Anything less is simply useless. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book and I mean really loved it, you will not approve this movie and chances are you already know you would not like it. Because the book is flawless and this film proves how impossible it is to cram something fitting into a small reel of film. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
