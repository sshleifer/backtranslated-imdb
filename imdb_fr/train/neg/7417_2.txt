This film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - It is hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or the following years. "Love's Brother" (located in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing more than superficial clich√©s about Italian culture, and it is quite telling that even Italians from Italy and Italy speak English in the movie. The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is really unpleasant. Giovanni Ribisi is good enough in films like "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation", but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. See this movie at your own risk. Trash can as trash!
