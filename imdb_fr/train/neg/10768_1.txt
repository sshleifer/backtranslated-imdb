This film encourages Canadians and the British to be stupid and stupid idiots. The men are stoned / drunk, then shout / beat each other in almost every scene. Women are superfluous to the story ?? I do not understand what they are there for ?? they spend each scene causing a ruckus, or worse, to be furnished like hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either vulgar quarrelsome vagabonds or huge hippie chicks. This is the classic girlfriend, her losing boyfriend and her nasty silly mother that we have seen in countless movies. <br /> <br /> Every character here is an infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any type of scene involving sex with George Wendt ?? shudder ?? is enough to make gag! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in ?? but I can not understand why he would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed that money. Ian Tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague moment of redemption, but his talent is lost here. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the plot? the three fools trying to recover their dope ?? yawn - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is in fact a very lively character in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece?) Although I am ashamed of having even thought of comparing these two films), why even bother? Karl is so annoying that the circumstances of his death seemed gratifying to him. <br /> <br /> At the end of this miserable movie, I thought they'd better get off with him on this boat!
