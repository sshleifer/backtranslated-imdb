Getting lost in the frozen space for 15 years is unlikely. Falling into a star ... unlikely. Fall in the day he goes in supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. Being rescued by a ship at that time ... is priceless. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Zaphod Beeblebrox's Golden Heart that comes to the rescue. It is not the winner of the year either. After damning her daughter in solitary confinement for two years aboard an abandoned spacecraft, the mother encourages her to get drunk and walk away alone with the strange man they captured. This foreshadows their prowess in hand-to-hand combat, which is the essence of the action of the film. Highlights of the fight include, for example, the psychopath who speaks closely, facing a woman, while blindly pointing the weapon behind him to the other, about six inches away, which, necessarily, cheat in the line of sight. <br /> <br /> In the end, the family of three abandons the vessel the size of a metropolis she planned to use to observe the supernova until the last moment, because it is too slow to escape the explosive wave, but rather use the combat ship of the psychopath they have refueled in a minute. with 1600 pounds of gas propellant a missile of 0.7 kilotons. You must love these scary science fiction statistics! <br /> <br /> While Hollywood considers writing to be an extravagant luxury, she continues to shoot films that are not worthy of showing at 3 am on the Sci fi channel.
