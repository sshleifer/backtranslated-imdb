It is a completely uncomfortable film, although very well done. I tried it because it starred Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and the plot, a mafia boss about to be released from a psychiatric institution, looked promising. The film is presented as a comedy, somehow. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should excuse the pun - of subdued and elegant, but somewhat surreal, interior people shooting at each other - in the head, belly, patella The foot, Anatomy is avoided, it seems, during the establishment of a vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which are supposed, obviously, to be humorous in a post-modern way. Goldblum's dialogue for the entire film could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic smile - all the way through. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing their best. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. The credit list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I missed them (good decision on their part). Everything is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; I guess he's an heir to the "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers" styles. If you liked these, you will probably like this.
