I am a big fan of the television series Largo Winch. This film was painful for me. I had to use Fast Forward not to fall asleep. It was boring! How can anyone ruin this title? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is nil. Look at the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were incredibly boring and could not be followed. In no way should they follow the situation. Like another reviewer said a low budget movie with bad actors. Maybe next time someone can do better with this title. French can not do the right thing with big movies, like Alien 4. It was little after Alien 1,2,3.
