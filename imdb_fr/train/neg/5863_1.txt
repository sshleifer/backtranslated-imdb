I really can not believe that this movie is not in the worst of 250 IMDB, it is absolutely terrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it in a university class and two other people had seen it. We all told the other members of the group not to see him because it was so horrible. By the time we finished, others wanted to see him just because they could not believe something was as bad as we said. Do not be like them, let that go. I'm sure everyone involved in this film would also prefer that you never see them in this movie.
