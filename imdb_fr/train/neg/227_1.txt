Was it a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with a playful joke between three women. Well. This creates a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Well. There are some antics between them. Well. But when the plot thickens and ends up black, I wondered if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. He continues in this vein for a moment until, finally, he tries to return to the light and original joke. But now it's too late. It's hard to see why these women would talk to each other again and the end is unconvincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) on how not to make movies. It's hard to see how producers have ever convinced themselves that this film would work. And the box office proved that it was a real failure, because I had never heard of this film before this weekend (four years after its release).
