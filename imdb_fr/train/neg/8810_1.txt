This film is one of those I regret to have invested 90 minutes of my life and in which I will never come back. The principle is really interesting. It's basically a zombie film from the point of view of the undead they are actually dead or not}. Unfortunately, they fail to tell a fascinating story in this setting. The almost unbearable monotony of the life of the main characters can add to the realism of the film, but it aspires the full value of entertainment If they had put a little more effort to keep the viewer engaged, it would have been much more likely that they would bring the social commentary home.
