If you do not know what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been left on the shelves for too long and wants to burst. She has a teenage daughter who just points out that she does not get any younger. While watching her daughter, she discovers a world in which she has never dared ... the cabaret, where she can dance belly in thin sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamous. His representation of men is lamentable. Which is rather strange as Lilia stops wagging for them, not for money, but just for hell. When she manages to wake them up, she feels like a woman again. She does not want to communicate with them but she is addicted to attention. Most of the other dancers are older women who look like men in a train and realize that their time in the spotlight is short-lived. Not enough, I say. She finds the romance, as brief as it is, with you guessed it ... No surprise here, we have not seen coming. Although the end is good, you realize that it could not have ended otherwise. Maybe this movie just does not target my demographic - 30 Male
