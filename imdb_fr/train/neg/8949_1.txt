A few weeks ago, I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. I was fascinated by this book and I thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So, when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how good that adaptation was. Unfortunately, the film did not even create the mood or develop the characters that Orwell so masterfully created in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who watches the film has read the book, because it does not try to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel what they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is funny all along the way and plays virtually no role before the end. We never really find out what he's doing in life, why his love relationship is forbidden, what the political climate is and why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not be done in the form of a film without proper narration and an explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest flaw in this film. On top of that, John Hurt was an appalling casting choice, seeming to be about 15 years older than Winston, 39, whom he was supposed to represent. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the distribution was well chosen. It's just a shame that they were shot in a film so horribly adapted to the bad main actor. -Brian O.
