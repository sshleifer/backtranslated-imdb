The worst collaboration of De Niro Scorsese in this horrible and violent violent disorder. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this film with the horror clich√© suddenly loudly ringing the phone and wearing gimmicks that seem ridiculous and bothersome coming from such a master craftsman. The casting is totally lost here and the southern accents are very boring and forced. Nick Noltie plays the role of the most devious lawyer in history who believes he can defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90s psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis is very delicate at first and the climax continues and we should all be more than tired of the psychopathic tracker who never dies. One of my most horrific experiences at the movies. Rent the original, it's 100 times better. <br /> <br />
