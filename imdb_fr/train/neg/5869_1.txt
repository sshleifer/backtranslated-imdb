It's been almost 30 years and I ALWAYS hate everyone involved in this movie. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw that, I had never thought of Rivers, either way. After seeing this film, I had an allergic reaction when I saw it by chance on television. <br /> <br /> I was trained to this - against my best judgment - by the pressure of my peers. However, on leaving the theater, these friends swore never to cancel my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still have mental traces of this film. <br /> <br /> On my death bed, one of my regrets will be the time I have lost hope that this film will improve. This has never been the case. <br /> <br /> If you are given the choice, you will prefer to let yourself go at this moment to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered for IMDb comments just in the I hope I can maybe warn others against viewing this movie. If I can save one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
