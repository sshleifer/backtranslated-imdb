I hope that the one who trained these losers on their accents was fired. The only strong points are some minor characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed at the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put this in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole plot is about sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to mark vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, sex without vampire, sex because we are afraid of vampires, sex because we are angry at vampires, sex because we have just become a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it was a little more subtle to be involved in the scenario. Maybe you have a script, then do you have sex? But they did not even bother to do that ... and Anna Paquin is a vertiginous bitch. Either she fears, or her character fears, I can not understand which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the plot that I find highly implausible is why Bill, a 150-year-old vampire who seems to have his business together, would be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly attacks him for things he can not control. He leaves for two days and she already decides that he "will not come back" and suddenly has feelings for the dog-man? Leave me alone. She is supposed to be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her are dying everywhere and she has the most brilliant smile because she just gave her virtual card to a guy because she can not read in her thoughts? As the main character in the story, I would have hoped that the series would do a little more to make it understandable and for someone to invest your interest, not someone you secretly keep hoping to get killed or put in the coma. I do not find anything I like in her character and even the fact that she knows how to read minds is really uninteresting and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my time watching season 2 come June.
