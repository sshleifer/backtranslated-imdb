I was expecting to enjoy a romantic comedy starring hip-hop, but I was disappointed in many ways. First of all, the story is so badly recycled that it is almost unbearable. Secondly, the set, the acting and the story are neither very authentic nor credible. Thirdly, there are many more good black actors to choose from. How about originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in full - if any. None seemed really central. Overall, the movie was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the movie worthy of being useful.
