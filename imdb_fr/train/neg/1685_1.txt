All children aged 14 to 16 want to see this movie (even if they are only allowed at 18). They heard it was a very scary movie and they feel so cool watching them. I am very sad that children do not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible to find a decent title for such a stupid story. This film is just made to scare you, and if you're a little clever and know a little bit about music, you know exactly when you'll be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished and I turned to my friend to tell him (a little loud) that it was a total waste of money, a stupid kid seemed strange to me . Today, I could make an Oscar with a video of my goldfish at home, if only I used good marketing.
