I agree with the comments of other users that the two main roles were well played, that is to say the guy who played the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story is so boring. Not hearing about the story, I did not know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but I was wrong. The entire movie was just talking, talking and talking about their father and mother. The only nice scenes were the flashbacks where the father got angry. That's the only interest I got from this borefest.
