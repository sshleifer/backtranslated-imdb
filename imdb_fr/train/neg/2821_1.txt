I only saw this film once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little intrigue and seems to be only continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little else. I wanted to see this movie because it featured Zoe Trilling's second "Night of The Demons"; and I wanted to see her play someone normal. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's script just begins and goes nowhere, as Robert Englund dominates the film and tells the story and the plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; to hide from this movie!
