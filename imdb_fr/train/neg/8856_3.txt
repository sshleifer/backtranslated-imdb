Lee animated 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about filming werewolves. He said his only contact with lycanthropy was The Howling II, and then joked, "The less we say, the better." Indeed, he was right because this film is perhaps the worst of its catalog of performances on screen. Joe Dante's first Howling movie was a revolutionary film about werewolves with incredible special effects and a sense of style and material. It was a film to be taken seriously. As for other good original films, the filmmakers thought, for some strange reason, that more movie sequences were needed than what was working the first time (see CHUD and then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles from the first on all fronts. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is black like most of the main scenes. Lee is the only notable actor in the movie (okay, I'm going to give in to Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed when he says a foolish dialogue and does ridiculous things (see that ending with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this brothel is a little more insightful than the two leaders leaving America to go to Romania. The story is not really worth considering here, and you can bet that very little history is worth mentioning when Stephen Parsons and his band Babel have to play a big part of the film in the beginning and end with this terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she undresses once, then we see this scene over and over again - a reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but I would have been so bored to that point). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I awarded are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions. Yuck!
