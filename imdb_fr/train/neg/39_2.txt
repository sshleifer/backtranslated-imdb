An actress filming in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires someone to bring her back. Jungle cannibals love a really ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> It's a bloody and gloomy movie. There is a lot of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploitation film designed to appeal to the darkest regions of our being, and if the movie was not so boring, this movie would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster, this movie is a repeater. The rhythm is quite out of sync and puts you out. There are several intrigues that all seem to happen separately, even if it's finally a story. Even worse, hardly anyone says anything. Most of the minimal dialogues involve the cruelty or protests of a character saying "I will do what I want". It's so quiet and boring that if it were not for the frequent cry of the victims, I would recommend it as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or <br /> <br /> (An aside VideoAsia has just released it as part of their Terror Tales series. Their imprint is strangely in mailbox, which seems to be the result of the impression they take comes from a Japanese source (there is steam) that has been cropped to remove the subtitles. no opening title)
