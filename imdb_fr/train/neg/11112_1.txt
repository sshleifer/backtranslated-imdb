Wow, how bad can it be? It was really serious. Not in terms of gore - which was mainly a laughable CGI - but in terms of play, atmosphere and staging. <br /> <br /> The story was awful - the arc of character of the main scene was a joke. A few nights after stalking Vinnie Jones, he begins to be "haunted" to the point of crying while photographing his girlfriend. Uh ... are all New York photographers childlike, suggestible and weak? The development of his character had absolutely no justification or argument - and in the end, you will be completely crazy to laugh at the totally predictable and completely absurd turn of his character. <br /> <br /> The bloody moments were clearly just a weak and undervalued effort to jump into the modern MTV-style gore wagon - all cgi, blood but no real emotion whatsoever. These parts were unintentionally amusing - and bothered by their self-consciousness - crazy camera angles, and so on. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have been an atmosphere (until stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favor of the conscious direction of the "look at me" style. This film was not made for the public - it was made for a resume - a deeply selfish motive.
