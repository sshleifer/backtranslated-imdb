This film is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's good to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and misinterpreted (eg "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Of course." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Every fight is more or less surreal . Make sure to watch Brock, the white guy who attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
