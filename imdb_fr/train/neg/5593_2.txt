I love Dracula but this movie was a total disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies of my youth, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if it was my youth that made me believe that Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with his style, his appearance, his attraction and the evil behind it. Or maybe it was just this movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a posh English accent and the body language that goes with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices from the characters, is it boring and has no tension? So it's a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not see it! I only gave him a 2 because I managed to stay awake throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you liked this movie, you must be deprived of sleep and be alone at home in a dark unguarded space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents' house or in a house of strangers. Because even the characters in this movie did not seem to be afraid, and I think that sums it all up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this film because of its place in the history of Dracula's film, perhaps being fascinated by the story of Dracula, of Nosferatu, has evolved to become what it is today. Because the film is not so attractive, it does not attract you into the suggestive mystery that, for me, makes the myth of Vampyre so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And in addition, he has so many things that the 70s feel. The landscape looks like cheap theater. And I'm not saying that reject everything that was done in the 70s. Because I can love old film as well as new.
