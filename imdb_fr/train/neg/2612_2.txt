The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was his nominations for the original design of the Oscars song and costumes. I must admit that this movie did not impress me. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close does this very well) is released from the hospital because of her good behavior. She loves all sorts of animals and locks up all her furs. From that moment, we do not wait for it to start having crises. Soon, she does it and tries to create the best coat in the world of fashion, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Except for Glen Close, I found all the actors pretty idiotic but amusing with a child's eye. I guess it's fair enough because its target market is, I guess, kids under 12. It's a good entertainment for kids and families, but it did not do much for me. * out of *****
