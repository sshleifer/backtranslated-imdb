It's a film that takes a little digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a hard outer shell, a story that not only derives from the Catholic Church, but does so stupidly and uninformed. On an inner layer, we are offered a history of Orthodoxy on orthopraxis, and what happens when people blindly follow a faith that they must not understand. At first glance it seemed like it was a comedy. If that's the case, Mr. Durang has to open a dictionary because he obviously does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; the humor is clumsy and poorly delivered. In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is fickle and disproportionate, far below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is once again the model of stridence, with her high voice and groaning style. All this could be forgiven if it had not been for the last 20 minutes of this film, it was obviously a controversial piece created in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Attention, the upcoming breakers *** <br /> <br /> It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Marie-Ignace (Ignatius, by the way, is a male given name and a nun would not adopt her after her wishes) , no matter the reason, just to show you how much tireless research has been undertaken in the project.) When they all admit that they do not respect the teachings of the church, the sister becomes irrational and mistreats them as the public the wish. I think she did it a long time ago in sepia tinted flashbacks, too clich√©s. When one of them confesses to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more violent until the student releases her weapon. After having removed her from her, the nun kills the student, presumably in self-defense. She then launches into a screaming outburst, killing a former gay student because of her sins. The last blow is that of a dead female student lying in a posture similar to that of Christ, suspended in the shadow of a cross. Can you say "heavy hands? I knew you could do it! <br /> <br /> I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know that many people have been emotionally hurt as a result of these acts, but this image is transmitted to us almost every two. in this train sinking of a movie. The writer and the director told me that it was a film about hysteria and about why orthodoxy should not be followed so religiously, without a play on words. This explanation is difficult to swallow, however, simply because we never receive an authoritative point of view that is not biased against the Catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply an anti-Catholic throng that, in the name of equity and equality, is petty and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a film I would recommend to a Catholic, especially to wake up the realities of what the cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it was "Rabbi Ray explains everything" or "Imam Muhammad explains everything," there would be riots in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription. But, unfortunately, as this is a film that strikes against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same vicious point of view. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that all The cast member was a practicing Catholic, so it's not just ignorance that led her to make this film. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.5 out of 5 stars, not because of its offending character, but because of it was poorly written, poorly done and just a bad movie in general. Do not even waste your time.
