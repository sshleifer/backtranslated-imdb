The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "The attack" is basically a parody to the "Plane!" (two years before the fact - good start.) what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack. <br /> <br /> By all kinds of cinematic magic (stop motion, paper mache tomatoes on skateboards, inverted turning, people watching tomatoes off screen, people throwing tomatoes the size of a balloon basket on the actors on the screen), the tomatoes attack indeed everyone within reach of their leaves. <br /> <br /> Then it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I do not want, on the government side, to save the world. Of course, there is a reporter (Taylor) who intervenes in the worst moments, dancing and singing soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, a guy dragging a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, the San Diego Chicken before he managed to grow it. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not so great. In fact, you could probably make up better after watching these videos. Some dialogues are extremely bad ("Please, pass the ketchup" - it's not something to say in front of tomatoes.) And as for "Puberty Love" ... well, I do not can not blame the tomatoes for shrivelling. hearing it. <br /> <br /> What is good? Well, I liked the theme song and the opening credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at a time that was pretty well executed. ... that is just about everything. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a comedy "Killer", but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
