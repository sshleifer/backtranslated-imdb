Have in-laws for the weekend? Then, it is the film to hasten their departure, otherwise a catatonic state will be relieved by the constant procrastination. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposed to take place aboard a luxury cruise liner, which car-ferry quaint; the plot has more holes than the medium strainer and a dredged cast in the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting entertainment is to play "Spot the Villain" as the passengers join the ship. You will not go wrong !!!! With a scenario flowing faster than a brick, clichÃ© sets and large amounts of raspberry jam, this film seeks to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest while simultaneously failing. > <br /> You have to watch a movie, if only to laugh at the seriousness of the situation.
