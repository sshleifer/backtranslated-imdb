When I first heard about "Solar Crisis" and then got myself, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then, I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now, I know it. <br /> <br /> For a film that encompasses space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, it is an extremely narrow and claustrophobic trait; we have the impression that everyone is pressed against each other so that the camera is not forced to retreat. <br /> <br /> And the effects, even if they are good, are rather disappointing; we are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not hijack a deadly solar flare. But aside from screaming, sweating and a red glow about everything, there is no real sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Do not get me started in the casting. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, and others do in this film without even bothering to act with the slightest idea of ​​the material, is not surprising. You wonder who the other condominiums are not paid in Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> And as for the end ... Well, let's say it's tense and intriguing, but that is too little too late in an effort like this. If the film had followed this rhythm throughout the film, I might have heard earlier about "Solar Crisis". <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for missed opportunities and poor career choices. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his work like stupidity like that?
