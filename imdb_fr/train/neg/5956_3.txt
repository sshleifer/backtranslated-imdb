Another horror movie in which a crazy teenager fights a madman and his supernatural acolyte who want to take over ?! Yes, but the fact that it comes from Canada gives it a slightly different impression. "The Brain" is responsible for the teenager Jim Majelewski who is following a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader helped by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess since our neighbor to the north has done all he has done, he has the right to do at least one ridiculous horror film. Nevertheless, they will probably want to be recognized for their national health care, etc. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why did not the people who made this film do it?
