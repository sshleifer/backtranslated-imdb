After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review of it. <br /> <br /> It could have been a pretty decent film if it had not been for camera work. It was more boring. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during combat sequences. The connections were even horrible. <br /> <br /> The story goes that Sonny Chiba engages as a bodyguard to anyone wishing to take him to the top of a network of drug addicts. Judy Lee approaching him, who is never quite frank with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, as the crowd and another gang of thugs look for her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and, despite the horrible dubbing, the film could have been interesting. With better direction and editing, I'm sure it would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. In fact, it looks more like another 70s action movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence contains a familiar quote from Pulp Fiction fans, then continues in a school karate in Times Square. no connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
