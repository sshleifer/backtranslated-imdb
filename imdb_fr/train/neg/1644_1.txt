Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would dethrone Last Action Hero, but that's no problem. The film talks about 3 single guys who meet on Sunday to discuss their weekend sex getaways. A fourth guy - who is married and - who was part of the group introduces himself and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs.
