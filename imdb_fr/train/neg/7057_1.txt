It's one of the most irritating and absurd films I've ever had the misfortune to miss. Whenever it started to look like everything was fine, there are more sepia flashbacks, followed by paranoid idiocy posing as a social comment. The main character, Maddox, is a so-called manipulative rebel who lives in a mansion apparently without any parent or responsibility. Supporting actors are all much more friendly and interesting, but unfortunately are never developed. Nor do we ever understand that John Stanton's character allegedly incited Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought, "Aha, Maddox is just crazy and secretly invents all these communications from Stanton, a mentally ill fleeing, now we go somewhere!" but of course, it ends up not being the case anymore and the whole film proves useless, from the point of view of Maddox and the spectator. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
