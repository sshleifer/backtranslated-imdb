You do not need to write a script for this scandal! You can sit and watch a pair of moonlight women and guests jostle for a wild public show at "The Jerry Show"! Violent and hateful, this exchange on Jerry Springer's real-life program reveals all that the oversized talk show does not show you on the air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by producers of "Cops ". Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateur acting game of the decade! This shows that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a turkey movie. To change the channel! REJECTED <br /> <br />
