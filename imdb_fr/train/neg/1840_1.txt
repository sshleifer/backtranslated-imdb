It must be the most brutally disappointing "comedy" I have ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as crazy homeless Can not make me laugh? Something is wrong with this picture. It's the only movie I've ever wanted to go out. I used free passes and I always felt like I wanted to get my money back. I can say without hesitation that the only movie I have ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worst. movie. I laughed very lightly at the carousel scene, and that's it. Spending 2 hours in a comedy should make you laugh more than one laugh, right? I do not know, I guess filmmakers thought that "flan" was a fun word, or something. And the other joke is to beat a dead horse, literally.
