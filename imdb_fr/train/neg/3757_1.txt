How did it ever exist? I usually like science fiction / Bigfoot regardless of movies, etc. . but I still expect them to be written without as much cheese as this one. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I ended up praising it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson - I still have not seen this one). The idea of ​​the film is good. There was a lot of potential for making a good movie here. I just do not understand how something like this ends up like this. Go talk to students interested in film / arts / English at any high school and you will find people who can write a better script.
