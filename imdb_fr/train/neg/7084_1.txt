As many others have said, it's a dreadful film, in all its aspects. The way they had known actors to take charge of this project is incredible. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that it was shot with "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was shot in video, but not in "cheap" video. What has made the thing bad is the lighting, the balancing of the whites, the technique of filming and editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different filming and editing techniques that it was a waste of production. Hard and inconsistent lighting, excessive use of handheld shooting (Woody Allen, for example), unstable fixtures (another Allen technique), but poorly executed, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant's kitchen the scenes are embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> Simulated sex scenes have no interim value. <br /> <br /> The way this video was printed is beyond me. It is worth looking if only to be surprised how bad it is.
