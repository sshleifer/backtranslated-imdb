The original Japanese movie "Gamera" from 1965 http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of Gojira (Godzilla) darker and less child-oriented for the sensibilities of the 1960s. Gamera , of course, is a giant flying turtle that literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in many ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and edited by the famous Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla the King of Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" takes more than the wrong spelling. The American scenes are not as ridiculous and boring as those added to the great Gojira, but do not add much to the story, as they are little followed. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a promising way. There are some character development scenes and enough personalities to create tension outside the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the movie begins to go down in a rather banal movie. Kaiju. <br /> <br /> The acting is enough, even American complements are acceptable. The staging is pretty good for this period and this kind, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all the miniatures). Some sets and decorations are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that this movie has little or no original. Gamera, however, is developing a much more unique personality in his latest films - most of which are worth watching if you're a fan of kaiju.
