it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still not sure whether it's serious or just a satire. One of those movies that uses all the stupid stupid clich√©s that they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good at this. But otherwise, it was bad. I saw it more than 10 years ago, but it always hurts and keeps staying in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie sums up how stupid he is. I will not spoil it for you, if you want to tempt fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a moment of * nghya * at the end, with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do and love to point fingers and laugh, then maybe it will be worth it. Also, if you have to go to an appointment with someone you really do not like, suggest watching this movie together and it will probably leave you alone after seeing it. It's a fair price to pay, I guess.
