Surprisingly, the film has some redemptive quality when it comes to an end. For the other part, this movie is really bad and lame, with a small budget, an insulting script and a bad script and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's silly that all the money circulating in the Christian circles can never seem to have enough funds to make a decent movie. I'm not a religious, so I do not care, but filmmaking makes it a good tool for reaching out to a new church audience and arousing the interest and curiosity of people to read the Bible, for example. In this respect, these films always seem to be a lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> The small budget really hurts the film and reduces it. This makes the film ludicrous to look at with its effects and simply gives the film as a whole a B-movie impression like this. <br /> <br /> But what hurts more this film is his writing. What's going on in this film is just insulting to the intelligence and I do not even complain or talk about the religious aspects of this whole story. The way the film is moving is so unlikely and the people in this film are doing things so improbable that it's insulting to the audience. <br /> <br /> I also hated how the movie sounded like a soap opera. It seemed to me that they were just struggling to turn this film into a feature film and that they were adding dramatic characters and developments to fill the needs. Sometimes I did not really care less. <br /> <br /> It must be said that the film becomes stronger and more stable towards the end, when its story focuses more on its essence. It's still predictable, but it has kept this movie from being a wreck to watch, and in terms of this type of film, there's a lot worse to watch there, although I do not think so. that this movie will win another one. new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
