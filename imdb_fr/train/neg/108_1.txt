Benefits: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: Everything <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: A journalist meets a hitchhiker who tells stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life have I encountered such a bad movie The Zombie Chronicles. Shot on a budget of about $ 20, TZC is a horrifying horror movie that relies on lame and forgetful actors who could not act to save their lives and their gore, which is more rude than frightening. How is a film like this one made? In simple terms, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last two cents: This film was made with humor by a production company called Brain Damage Films. These are brains that had to be really damaged to come up with such a spectacular film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would have the negative note bajillion)
