the intention of the directors of this film is quite honorable, but the history of its productions made me realize that it might not be as fundamental as other filmmakers would do. to keep in mind his major 30-day TV series but also to count in his MTV production "I bet you will do it", which contradicts his seriousness in all the fields he documents and also counts in his rather disappointing production , "superimpose me", hope at the top. Unfortunately, this film nevertheless disappointed me. as with "supersize me" after a while, I wondered what exactly was the purpose of it all. After half an hour, the main statement becomes clear enough, but the rest of the recess is filled with rather useless stuff and repeated rehearsals that have already been shown this way or another earlier in the film, so that the film wears out and becomes extremely boring. the end.
