The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I have watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot about the intrepid journalist who was investigating the racketeering slavery / white prostitution that drove her from San Francisco to Rome, and then to Macau. hometown, New York! The film is populated by former veterans of the series who play, inexplicably, completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (who sits here at the head of a United Nations Committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (although it is broadcast in the middle of the night), it is heavily mounted and is a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr) where a trafficker of Asian slaves pulls out of the game getting sodomized by a dog is nowhere else! Yet a poignant sequence at the end of the film where a shady politician cheats two girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert ) at a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a bunch of tramps (that's how he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high-society friends waiting for glances stunned - seems pretty well intact. <br /> The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from Gems Her penchant for undressing herself every time she enters a house (even in front of complete strangers) ) - it's his trip to India to interrogate a man harlatan / guru (George Eastman made so much like Christ!) who found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; of course, when Emanuelle calls him, he ends up having premature ejaculation ... !!
