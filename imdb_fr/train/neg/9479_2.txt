This movie seemed to be better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the acting seems solid, the dialogue was not too stiff ... but after about twenty minutes, there is this long scene with a doctor who, you know, is actually a patient to the asylum posing as a doctor - and from there, he heads south. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the demon is the most stupid hell ever since Godzilla appeared in Curse of the Demon. There are also some demon worshipers who wear masks that look like teenagers in the explosion of the early days of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography could not save this film. Despite some strong performances from the actors, the story goes nowhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for that.
