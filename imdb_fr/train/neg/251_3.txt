I was so excited to see this movie after I finally read the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to that too. I rented it and I huddled to enjoy a classic animated vacation story on screen. <br /> <br /> Little boy, I was disappointed. This film has moved away from the book more times than it is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this field, he seemed to have been fully in the character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time, he was rather flat. <br /> <br /> I realize that this was done in 1984, with pre-CG effects, for the most part. But that seemed like a B movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: Christmas Present takes Scrooge around the world with observing people in the darkest circumstances always have the light and love of Christmas time. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "reformed" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing portrait. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit was described as a little more torn and trampled. And Tiny Tim ... oh, do not even get me started on bad kids actors ...
