The original "visitors" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The worst first following a very good movie". In LV2, everyone keeps shouting. When a gag does not work first, it is repeated 5 times, with a vague hope that it will eventually become funny. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody must be inventive. If you liked LV1, do not see this movie, come back!
