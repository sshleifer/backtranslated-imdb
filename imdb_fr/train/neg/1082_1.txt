I think I saw all of Grisham's films now and generally they are all very poor, except The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad that it's amazing <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH < This is one of those movies where the character does stupid and irrational things that nobody would do. He is a lawyer for the love of Christ. Why, when his children disappear, does he not call the police? Oh yes, it's because all the police hate lawyers, so they ignore him and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, he is released, he is locked in a cell. waiting for a bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why would you want to drag your children to the other side of the country, when you could easily protect them at home? <br /> <br /> The police do not bother trying to find an escaped mental patient, they do not bother to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> Regarding the ridiculous end ??. <br /> <br /> In summary, silly, very unrealistic and a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst films ever made.
