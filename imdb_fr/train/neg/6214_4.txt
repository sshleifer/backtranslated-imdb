What?!?? Why do people say it's "hallucinating"? Right in front, the end of the worst in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention the character 9, he was an idiot all the time he had everyone killed. He was right all the time, if he had sacrificed then none of that would have happened. The people who give there live for a stupid cause and for what? ... to rain? I admit that the film had its parts and that the concept was fascinating. But many shots one after the other. And did anyone else feel that he looked a lot like "The Lord of the Rings?" The characters died for stupid reasons, there was virtually no character development and, honestly, ask yourself if it's good to have only four guys in the world; it's useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen, and thank you! How do robots turn against humans in any way! This has been done a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that is worth seeing like Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, they were good movies!
