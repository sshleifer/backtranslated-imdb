People like me will rip this movie. It's just not realistic. The plot is so predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens easily. Of course, they find the treasure and become very rich and deceive the bad guy. We have seen it a million times before. The writers of this film must think that the majority of the film made public is stupid. They must be right because the majority of people really liked this movie. I mean solve puzzles in seconds. The treasure room hidden beneath the Manhattan subway? You would think of all the work done on the New York subway. This room has already been discovered. and everything that was built during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? how cute it is, and I thought romance in Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds, but I would be more concerned with saving my own ass than having some. hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 garbage
