It was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto comes out sometimes with a good one. I found the first two movies of 'Demons' extremely entertaining - they were so bad they were great, but this one is so bad that it's really, really bad. It's terribly boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife who slaps the husband and the crying pain of the crying baby in the woman *** was driving me crazy probably the best actor of all the film. I turned it off three-quarters of the way because I was very, very bored! Do not bother yourself.
