The Mummy's Tomb begins with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand, then advances several years throughout history in the United States of America where the current high priest and mummy Kharis begin to wreak havoc and to take revenge. those who have broken the grave in the past. <br /> <br /> While I absolutely loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff in the role of the mummy Imhotep, and well liked "The hand of the mummy" with Tom Tyler in the role of Kharis (more direct to this film), I was not so caught up with "The Tomb of the Mummy". <br /> <br /> It is done in a similar style to the previous movie and presents a somewhat similar plot, albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is good like Kharis, but does not really stand out. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing exceptional either, so that the viewer ends up with a tasteless mum's tale.
