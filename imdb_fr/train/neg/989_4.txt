Okay, so I discovered this movie and watched the preview almost read all the reviews and had a hard time asking if I should watch it or not. Even before watching the movie, I was emotionally weird. I was so uncertain if I would watch this and be disturbed for a very long time. So I chose to take the risk and watch and follow what I thought: the beginning started well for me. He seemed to be going in a decent direction. Passed the scene of rape and I could not understand why people were so disturbed or so bored by the movie. Do not get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it did not really bother me. Then, in the middle, I understood what was happening. There was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walk around saying or showing nothing! it's one thing to have a plan where a person shows some kind of emotion but this movie did not have it. There were about 3 of these useless scenes, where you see the main character Maya become somehow uncontrollable, but that does not show, which makes me want to move quickly. Then when she engaged in the hardcore party, it was not so boring but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson did an excellent job. Let's move on. Finally, after an hour of uselessness in the center, revenge returns to Maya's attention. That's where it bothered. I did not feel bad for him or nothing gave him what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt utterly sorry afterwards. I can not really tell you whether to watch this film because it's so ... I do not know, I can not find a word to sum it up. But if you choose to watch it, do not be surprised.
