I must admit that there are few books with corresponding movies that I read before seeing the film adaptation. Nineteen Eighty-four happens to be one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and curiously prophetic. But the movie was just nil. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not turn it off after the first 5 minutes was that watching the movie was half a two-part assignment for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but nothing allowed to create the appropriate atmosphere. The acting was nothing more than average, and considering that there was not much to play, it was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston was unable to let out more than one syllable at a time. Annoying, disturbing and visually unattractive, the film totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second ... Is not that British?
