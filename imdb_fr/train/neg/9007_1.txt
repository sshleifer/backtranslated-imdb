This film is one of the worst bullshit I've ever seen. I literally had a headache watching this movie. The CGI was awful and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-understand-anything, except that he does not seem to be able to properly use his own helicopter. The biggest problem was the work of the split screen camera. I felt like I was watching Brady Bunch or something, but it was not different people in the boxes, just close-ups and different points of view on the same thing. I can only understand that the actors really needed money, because this film was not worth the film on which it was shot.
