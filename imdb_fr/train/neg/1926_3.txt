Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times during each of the last 2 Christmas, I feel qualified enough to make a judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well ... it's not very good. First of all, following a classic number like Chuck Jones' animated television series will be difficult for everyone, but this interpretation is so heavy and so padded that it produces positive numbness. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall, the film is a calculated money grab, at the same time as it is supposed to decimate the marketing of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually on the top here, but this is completely at odds with the Grinch character. As characterized by Boris Karloff, it burned slowly; methodical and devious. Carrey's madness is not a method, and it's the most obvious mistake. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely lost here. Why, universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will play just about any role on the show (much like his fellow countryman Michael Caine), but this one should be in "Movies that should never have been shot." That does not bode well for Cat in the Hat, an even slimmer film that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I feel like I'm making the same recommendation for this one as for this one: skip it and read the book or watch the special show. It's 2 hours that you can never, ever come back.
