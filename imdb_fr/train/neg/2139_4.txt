I really wanted to love that, but in the end, it's a badly made film, with too few laughs. <br /> <br /> Politics is perfect, it will offend the Republicans but that's what the goal is to do. . That alone gives me a reason to laugh. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it was done in a REAL PRESS (about a week). And it contains a stupid secondary plot about a bimbo singer, which seems to be completely off topic. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, Afghanistan or any other country with which the United States has since fought. the 50s Humor is a little dark (the amputees dance with prosthetic legs manufactured by Tamerlane) but it is on the mark, especially with the companies that benefit from the reconstruction ("light democracy"!) <br <br /> <br /> A lot of satire criticizing the United States, it seems terribly heavy and laborious. I guess it goes against so much propaganda, so you have to club people to get a message across. Who knows. I prefer the "nudge, wink" approach - a little subtlety. But it's only me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I might be able to look again. Maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope that "W" will be more useful.
