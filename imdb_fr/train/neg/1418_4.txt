I do not know why this conduct has never been tolerated in the movie industry! This film (short) is rude (to say the least)! It is a group of children aged 5 to 7 wearing diapers with big hairpins, behaving like adults (and too much!). However, it's interesting because it's a good example of how "the good old days" may not have been so good after all! (Thanks to God, we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is one of the shorts of the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
