Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the full version of DisneyNature's "Earth" movie. Like automakers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it deserves a special unity with the word "nature" in it. I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who should I tell a one-year-old about my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> Apart from an incredible cinematography, it was for me a typical Disney disappointment. Preceded by half a dozen Disney movie trailers, teeming with Disney clich√© ("circle of life", "falling in style"), dramatic music, recycled images (Disney claims "40% new images" ). I was even beginning to think that James Earl Jones's narration was getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman, which addresses every story of Warner Brothers, begins to falter. I really think that Disney bought BBC nature photographs in such a spectacular way that they felt like selling themselves if they slapped orchestral music and recognizable sound bites. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators hunting and killing baby animals? There were half a dozen scenes of this type, accompanied by young babes about to have their throats wrenched. I think Disney must recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and struggles for death that appeal to the action-oriented teenagers who have been drawn into this film by their parents. I also knew that Disney had gone so far as to suggest that man had something to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of Holocaust deniers that they think the subject remains controversial? <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not use this one and rent Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. The nature films seem to be better done by the British at the moment.
