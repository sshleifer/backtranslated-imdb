This film is supposed to take place in Seattle and the surrounding area. Why is the Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park presented? Provincial parks are located in CANADA and not in the United States. The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot with a stylus to "read" that someone has hacked the computer from the bride's store. I did not know that this was possible with a database storage device. A woman appears in the film without any introduction and is never presented. We learn half way through the movie that this woman is working in the prosecutor's office. Then, in the correctional center, a PREVIOUS Jenks guard through a door and keeps his back to the offender !! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional context. The director really messed up on this one - it does not happen in real life. The actors play is adequate. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, the many errors found in continuity lead to a vote of 3 out of 10.
