"Look, I know it can be nil right now, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever ... Whatever you do right now, celluloid is burned forever and for thousands of years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was originally a film by Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several writers to adjust the script to better match his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of Robert De Niro, recently released from prison. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the dysfunctional family unites to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical Spielberg way, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is quickly acquitted of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and practically all the "dads" of the Spielberg country, the father claims his paternal duty in the kind of sweet and sour coda that Spielberg loves so much. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg finally abandoned the image and the project was entrusted to Martin Scorsese, who was trying to try a more commercial rate. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography and, ironically, the most enlightening of all. <br /> <br /> The failures or failures of an artist are often very revealing and reveal the workings of his art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images do not burn, we end up with some kind of inner core. This ?? the remaining carcass is the raison d'Ãªtre of the director's cinema. <br /> <br /> Now, "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film. Therefore, we will not find any thematic link with the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("You have already sacrificed me!") De Niro screams, but the themes of the Catholic Redemption film are a cookie cutter. the kind of language that his filmography is based on. "Observe how Scorsese's camera goes back and forth desperately, how frantically he zooms in on the door handles and windows to try to force the tension and how his characters scream loudly. to attract attention, but more importantly, look at how the film has no spatial meaning.A confrontation on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place not in a larger context and the family's house does not seem to exist anywhere in particular.There is simply no geographical sense to the image, Scorsese being unable to film the Space or create any environment. <br /> <br /> The reason is that Scorsese's camera must always be linked, or closely related, to her central character. For the world around the character to have meaning, his camera must be centered on the character. Resnais can take you to a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance on a street and ride a building, Cameron can show you the Titanic, Scott can recreate a whole future cityscape, Lucas can give you an extraterrestrial planet, and most other directors can create a feeling of space by combining the "close, medium and wide" combinations, but Scorsese can not do it. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. It's all about the character. You break this rope, you leave this ring, this taxi, you look away from De Niro and everything collapses. It just can not break with this very documentary filming style, which is sort of a prerequisite for making action movies. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to solve this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and scenery become the central character, but even this conscious space experience is sabotaged by Daniel Day's magnetism Lewis, the actor inexorably drawing towards him Scorsese's camera like a moth. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, it's a ugly and vulgar movie. Look at matte paintings, inept tension attempts, stupid special effects with rotorscop and the hokey fistfight clash. Yet we have Robert De Niro to take over. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese as a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only big stage. In an improvised romantic sequence with the young Juliette Lewis, he puts his thumb in his mouth and kisses him. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl fled, both excited and repulsed by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so deliciously exaggerated, simply can not be imitated by Scorsese. For this to work, you need the opera tone and baroque visuals of someone like De Palma. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
