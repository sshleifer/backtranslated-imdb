One of the other commentators mentioned that they were almost gone. If I had not been with my wife who wanted to stay, I would have left. It's a shame too, because I think it could have been a good movie. But it's easily one of the worst scenario scenarios I've ever seen. It does not start anywhere and it's not going anywhere (I would say it's not going anywhere fast, but it's not really going anywhere ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are clues that something interesting might happen, or that there is some depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - clues. There is not a single gain or revelation in the whole movie. It's not that I need a refined plot to be entertained ... I love good studies of sinuous characters, as much as the next independent buff. But these characters add nothing. Throughout the movie, you do not care what happens to just one of them. In fact, you almost hope to see them die, because at least one death might be more interesting than looking at their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you would think it would be convincing in itself, but that's not the case . Instead of bizarre, black-esquire characters acting hard, you immediately recognize him for what he is: a group of talented but misguided actors who ruminate and raise eyebrows while reading a strange dialogue without any indication relevant context. All this for two hours painful and painfully slow. Terrible.
