I loved the first part, The impossible planet, but oops, what a disappointment the second part is "The Satan Pit". The cliffhanger of something that seemed to come out of the pit was - nothing was coming out of the pit. Then centuries spent crawling through round vents to stifle history, the Beast being a roaring object devoid of intelligence, so there was no Doctor / Naughty confrontation I had anticipated. The TARDIS is in some way in the pit although the pit is open only long after the fall of the TARDIS through the earth's crust. And finally, another ready-made solution that did not exist for a logical reason - I mean, why not plunge the Beast into the hole as soon as the pit opened? Why not plunge it into all these years instead of imprisoning it anyway. Why not - I could go on but I lost interest ...
