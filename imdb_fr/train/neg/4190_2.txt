I saw this film a few months ago in the city that appears in the film as Greendale. That's the only reason I went to see him. Another local person who was there just e-mailed me a new ad because the first one had been sold and people had been turned away. His editorial commentary in his front is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you're a fan of Neil Young or you live in / near Greendale (if you know the real name later), skip this movie. It's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. There is no discernable intrigue, the music is only OK, and too many words are incomprehensible, which prevents to follow the few shreds of intrigue possible. <br /> <br /> I do not need to put words. a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give. <br /> <br /> I would give a 1.5 / 10, but it's just for the fun value of seeing the places turned into movie. It was not worth the $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive around Greendale and make a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * movie with an environmental message without intrigue, go rent Koyaanisqatsi.
