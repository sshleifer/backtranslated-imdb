As a Hammer finalist, I dreaded the moment when I should have the courage to watch this movie and the one following it, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen One the Buses movie and thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of all the dreadful comedy that tormented the British TV screens in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this movie that made me to laugh. I do not know if it was because I knew the characters now and liked certain situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I could not swear at any point in the trilogy, he says his slogan: "I'll get you Butler." <br /> <br /> After watching Holiday on the Buses, the jokes began to be Wear Thin and these three films could be compared to Hammer's first trilogy, Dick Barton, as the second film is better (although this is probably the only way to compare them). <br /> <br /> only the people who would like to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series, which will undoubtedly appreciate it, as well as the Hammer Completists like me. For the finalists, I would say that this movie is not so bad and that I can certainly think of Hammer's worst comedies.
