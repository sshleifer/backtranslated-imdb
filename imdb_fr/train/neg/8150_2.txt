If you want an undemanding and fun time, you can watch that. It's not so bad, really. Yeah, there are more loopholes in logic that I do not want to describe here and that could put people's patience to the test - as I, I have to admit - who tend to throw things on TV on occasion, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always intentionally funny, it does not have to make you feel down. <br /> <br /> However, if you've read the book - or any of Brookmyre's other books - then you should probably avoid it. I read them all and when I looked at it for the first time, I despised it. In fact, I detailed it in detail and at length on another site. The TV plot has little relevance for the book and has only served to outrage and anger many of Brookmyre's (and certainly enraged) fans. <br /> <br /> Best advice ..? Look at this, then read the book and only THEN make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
