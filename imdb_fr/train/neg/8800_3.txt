A collection of deleted scenes and alternative shots, edited together and accompanied by a voice-over to give the impression that they take place after the events of the first. It's a good idea, but deleted scenes are left on the floor of the editing room for a reason, which is further proof. Since it's just not as funny as "Anchorman", and you have to face it, this movie has not been a gold comedy either, so you get a "movie" worse than the one that was moderately funny. In my opinion, this still places one or two notches above "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Add to your fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to the old school (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My note: D
