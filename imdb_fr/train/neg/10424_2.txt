I should like this movie. the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the film has always seemed very banal. the film gives working-class people a low, cheap air. The fact that the girl is ashamed of her mother and that her daughter does not outdo herself, has always made me a little uncomfortable. Barbara Stanwyck as a mother worships her daughter but she gives up a desire of mother to find happiness with her well doing the father's family. I wonder how many other people who have seen this film are of the same opinion. The acting was really good and worth watching. I really do not like the story. just a personal preference.
