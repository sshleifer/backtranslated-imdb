At least I had fun making fun of the movie, which is surprising since I could hardly sit through it. In all honesty, I guess the DVD case cover costs more than the entire movie. And by saying that it's the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of that just came out ... nice guys, it was pretty deceiving to get me into it. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable copycat game was his haircut. Usually, we see this kind of hair only on a boy of ten years and the character acted in this way. The film seems to have been shot by a D + graduate student from an enthusiastic film school to use every film technique he has ever learned while attending classes ... sometimes, the less more boyfriend. Throughout my life, I would lose myself in random twists that would lead nowhere or were unexplained. All of this makes a bad movie, but when the end does not even get it back, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. Without a doubt, it's the worst film I've ever seen, and that includes the French final video of my friends for high school, but hey, maybe I'm a bit biased, I mean I I could play an extra. P.S. I do not even think it deserves a star ... not even half. NO FOR YOU !!
