There is this girl and she runs in the woods but she ends up at the clinic of this woman and she wants an abortion. His dad is out in a van and he's very angry. The entire episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice but I wanted to have the choice to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby go out and he went to the corner. The part where they made the ultra sound was pretty funny too. I felt really sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I could not really blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and his daughter in the waiting room. I was laughing too much and would rather suggest watching "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode but it was not terrible.
