As usual, I rush to see the movies that I have not yet watched in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it seemed like everything was fine for me. I do not understand for the life of me why this movie had the buzz it has. There is no story !! A group of guys is meandering around Iraq. One day, they are here to spread a bomb. Tomorrow, they furrow the countryside alone and start firing shots. No, wait here, they are back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so characterized that they are only caricatures. I mean, we have the nice boy who is afraid of dying. We have the toughened soldier who is practical and just wants to get back safely. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who does not follow the rules but who has a weakness for the early Iraqi boy trying to sell DVDs of soldiers. What do you think it will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who does not respect the rules will make the sweet kid hurt with his renegade ways? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid for whom a cowboy soldier has a weakness for him will get killed and drive him crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera is often shaken to give an "artistic" appearance. And for all those who think it's such a beautiful war photo, go rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste your time and money on this boring movie!
