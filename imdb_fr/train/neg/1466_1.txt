<br /> <br /> As usual, I was eagerly awaiting a new film / television on one of my favorite subjects - it nicely changes from a * strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on History Channel. "I was anxiously waiting for Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but I was roughly knocked down with the realization of the evil, stupid, and stupid power of Hollywood - and of his ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe. <br /> <br /> That's why, once again, I was thrilled for "The Rise of Evil", especially since I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved because I loved his books. I can see why he resigned. <br /> <br /> To name a person responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic work," he said. "He was <br /> <br /> dry, we needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they totally crazy? It can not be said that Hitler's life is "incidental" - yes, Kershaw's biographies in his volume were long and detailed, but they were meant to be. <br /> <br /> The "Rise of Evil" thesis seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a VERY bad man, who hated Jews, and just in case you miss it, we will insist on the fact in EVERY scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> There has been no effort to try to explain the atmosphere of the moment and why Hitler may have adopted the point of view and the strategy he adopted. It goes without saying that, unlike the excellent "Nazis - A Warning of History," this film failed to point out that almost all the leaders of the Communist uprising in Munich were Jewish and that this may have altered his ideas about the subject. - and its axiomatic connection between Jews and Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understand a good part of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to be done - the filmmakers were not going to go, so we just got everything we knew anyway. We certainly do not understand the fascinating fact that Kershaw refers to, that Hitler is briefly socialist / communist immediately after the First World War. This would of course be far too complex for the film, and could even hurt the incantable "it was very bad", a mantra that keeps ringing. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even friendly and, of course, espouse views such as vegetarianism, the fight against alcoholism and smoking that many Guardian readers could subscribe to. He was also very fond of animals, which explains why this scene, entirely invented by flogging dogs, was so absurd. <br /> <br /> He was also, of all the stories I saw, a brave soldier of the First World War. While we saw him with his iron cross, we never see how he won it (acts of bravery did not appear in the script, needless to say). We do not understand why he was so excited about his wartime experiences, when Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remark and so many others found this experience so repulsive. And again, like the point above about the Jewish / Bolshevik connection, this is vital for anyone's understanding of the subject. Why did he so love the war? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care about his dead colleagues? Or maybe he did - while drawing the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This film had no interest to say on this subject either. <br /> <br /> Like too often, these days movies, the film is a classic example of "making history in relation to the present" and inventing things or leaving awkward facts to match " the present "- which too often is to answer the lowest common denominator, where Do not trust your audience, so you just have to ask them questions knowing (unfortunately) that you will always get away with it because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> The story really aims to make us relevant to the past and see how it colors our present, for better and for worse. This hogwash was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions, the places and the big scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us that we did not know already and they did not understand this dark period of human history. <br /> <br /> WT
