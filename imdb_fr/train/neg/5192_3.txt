It does not take long to understand why the code name: Diamond Head has not been incorporated into network programs. The TV pilot movie does not exceed the credits before it is obvious that everything will go wrong. I may have missed something, because the plot did not make much sense. Based on what I got out of the messy mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The dullest secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is there to stop him. There may have been more, but believe me ?? in any case, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. The moments of suspense should be suspenseful. And the dramatic moments should have drama. None of that in Code Name: Diamond Head. I have seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this done for snoozer TV? and it's better than any word description I can find. None of the characters are exciting or worthy of interest. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst tracks imaginable. His charisma is just slightly to the north of a slug. Ian McShane is by far the best thing about the film, but unfortunately he does not seem to be coming back as a regular cast member. Now, if McShane had been chosen in the lead role, you might have had something. <br /> <br /> I quickly discover that these terrible Gawd movies, made for 70s television, make great episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000.. And that's double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So even if I only give 3/10 to the movie, I estimate 4/5 of episode # 608 on my MST3K rating scale.
