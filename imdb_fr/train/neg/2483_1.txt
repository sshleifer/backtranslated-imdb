An incredibly bewildered turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie parodying a single problem with one big problem: it's deadly and without life. In addition to the I.Q. Intrigue and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk cast. Gene Wilder (star AND co-screenwriter) strives to do everything: he plays a romantic role (with his look !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen should create a club for aging comrades and no mirror), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and intelligent, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in NO !! A shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I thought I had a crisis of myopia, because everyone in the film keeps saying that Cherry Jones is this pretty hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is this stallion incredibly beautiful !! The guy who plays the male secretary of Claire Bloom is a skinny actor bald glasses, sexy as a chair and is the subject of the passion of the two great ladies! Mike Starr is the most incompetent and phonetic policeman you've ever seen who deserves to be among the 10 most odious performances in recent film history. The saddest note is to see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely strayed and spoiled offensively. At least I hope the two stars paid their bills at home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder Sukowa, the producing actor, returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for him! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make a very bad movie from a really bad scenario with a berserk casting director, study this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
