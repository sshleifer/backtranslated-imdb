"It's hard to say how exciting it is to make a relationship as in a drama, with all the pornographic scenes as if they were unfolding to a good extent, and to stir up as an adversary and make us more happy, like money and things like ". - Ellen, the lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, like, like, like, mouth and stuff" is like the best artistic project ever made. Watching as Ellen's hairy arms and Chris masturbating lived up to my long experience watching movies. But before you start, like breaking new US-20-some-air-airhead records with "likes," let me just briefly list the highlights of this visual as a feast: > <br /> 1. Chris does the act with his genitals. And not only that: the way the camera (so elegantly guided by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen photo of Chris's fat belly after completing the non-Catholic act - it was really exciting. In all honesty, I can say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more of this kind of stuff in your next movies, because that's exactly what we needed to continue with what this bright and brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" started. A quick punch, then a hairy belly, fat and white: what more to a spectator? Needless to say, I can spend all day watching Chris ejaculate (despite the fact that I'm straight) ... such a moving poetry. Such elegance, such style. No less than total inspiration, divine inspiration was devoted to filming this sequence - plus a solid amount of zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not have been more spiritual than this one. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's thick, hairy arms. The unstable close-ups, so skilfully photographed by our two directors of photography (I can not emphasize this point too much), Ellen and Patrick, have often been a source of confusion as to the correct identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes where you could see a part of a body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but it was often a game of riddles: does this part of the body belong to a man or a woman? wife? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and Whatsername, jumped on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this sex-based confusion. It was sometimes difficult to guess if we saw a female or male leg. Patrick is so thin and effeminate in his movements, so glabrous and virgin, while Ellen and the other girl are so rich, with their legs and their arms thick. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that is perfectly related to the theme of the reversal of roles between the sexes: so original and hallucinating. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen is looking for a companion on the left. "He must like 'The Simpsons', which is rather leftist." I am happy that the directors of this film have decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends manage to express in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). They managed to realistically transfer their real nonsense to the big screen with a minimum of effort, and I congratulate them. <br /> <br /> 5. The close-ups of the toes. A lot of things here for foot fetishists, which, in my opinion, is a very liberal and very commendable way to reach sexual minorities. After all, shoe and foot fetishists are so limited in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone cares about what's going on there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers much more than we perceive. It's not just a modest movie about superficial people engaging in empty relationships while engaging in meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. This is the light that guides all stupid creatures; the lighthouse that dominates the futile life of various pseudo-artistic aspirants who have just left the film school and plans to attack our senses with a light spirit that will normally take place in pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to win the necessary exhibition from where a real sum of money for a change, with which they will engage later personalities such as Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the safeguard of the planet and the regulation of ALL the political problems to which this world is confronted. What better way to do it than to do porn at the very beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen used the camera here, as the end credits clearly say, then who held the camera when they were both in front? They probably hired passers-by and put the camera in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and have a look at my article "TV & Cinema: 150 most serious cases "Nepotism".
