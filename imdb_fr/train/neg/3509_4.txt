Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone trying to get out. While Cube was tense, well done, claustrophobic and engaging the mind, I'm afraid that Cypher is a tedious and boring rehearsal of many well-used themes that do not do much, especially if you've seen almost sci-fi film half way decent before. <br /> <br /> Cypher managed to hang out throughout his relatively short 95 minutes until the incompetent end. None of the characters are burning, and for a film made in 2002, the technology is really old. It's hard to connect this tired and uninspired movie to the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good movie. <br /> <br /> When you've watched the grass grow and wither and you're bored of your insects, then watch this film, but the other activities will probably be more stimulating.
