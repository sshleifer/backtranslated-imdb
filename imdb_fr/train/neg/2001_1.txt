Why did so many people come together to attend Roberto Moreira's "All-In-One" screening at the San Francisco Film Festival? "This is a hit man," said my friend. "Well ... and it's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical climate, lush rhythms and gangster plot? Great seductions, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us a little detail: it is a very bad movie, really very horrible, and as unpleasant to watch that it is badly done. <br /> <br /> So how did Contra Todos tour Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many smaller local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently, because of the promotion process and the film festival circuit. <br /> <br /> First, he won first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was named best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year. they had a lot, a lot better. Then, catchy synopses in catalogs and an imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums, and since the film is not found anywhere else and thus avoids scrutiny from critics, it continues to film. on promotion, sometimes you have to do a lot. A Chicago festival called "Contra Todos" "a speedball cocktail shot straight from Brazil" and pointed to Claudia's boyfriend as the "slum quarter stud". Soninha is "the girl of nascent sexuality resembling the nymph of Teodoro". The film is "shot with the urgency of a camera held in the hand" and the director "creates a real and palpable sense of frustration, born of domestic despair and decadence". The effect is "unbearably crude and honest", and the film rushes "to a conclusion as ruthless as the exposed lives". This is not the best writing, but it certainly excites a certain type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is about a hitman, two shooting men, a woman, a woman and a son. Christian girlfriend born again. It's filmed - an ugly, ugly, ugly digital video behind the movie - mostly in a sterile, poor-looking suburb rather than in one of the "favelas" or slums of Brazilian villages-like towns where such magnificent films "Black Orpheus", "Pixote" and "City of God" were made, not in Rio this time, but in São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The man who has family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça) is the partner of choice. The two actors have a bit of experience on television, as does the actress who plays Cláudia (Leona Cavalli), the blonde and sluttish bride of Teodoro, and Silvia Lorenço, who plays her sulky daughter Soninha and is ready to go revolt. These actors could pass through the back corners of some telenovelas. Who knows? - in a better realized film, they could even be good. In addition to them, there are young men who are crushed by Teordoro or, when he is occupied, by gangs of thugs. The directors are not very present, even if the camera grows their pores. <br /> <br /> Two observers, one at the Berlin Film Festival and the other at the London Film Festival, saw the film's failures, but alas they're buried in the hinterlands of the Web. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the "film" (his quotes) was "the worst of the video works" presented. "The filmmaker seems to have chosen the video simply because it was a cheap alternative to the film," wrote Sheehan, "and did not use the new media creatively" - nor, he adds , does something else creative. <Br /> <br /> Sheehan pointed out the film's first big mistake: "It starts as a national drama that is supposed to take off when, half an hour after the beginning of the film, Moreira reveals that the father and one his friends are professional successes "Waiting for thirty minutes does not add anything to the film, it seems to be a perfectly arbitrary decision and is, at the very least, a waste of time. But ramping up is all that Moreira does, like a little kid who has a toolkit for his birthday, and will hit everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill. "Devastating, but true. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the 2004 London Film Festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side, but still highlighted the lack of reductive features to appeal to. performance "easily film" best feature. " Yes, very easily, since everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that "this low-budget, violent and sullen narrative of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of sympathetic characters and, therefore, hope ... Too dark and cynical to be an eloquent account of the human condition , the film is not helped by poor subtitling ... "Alsanjak linking Contra Todos to" Dogme "and Mike Leigh do not help things. <br /> <br /> Apart from this first half-hour meaningless in which nothing redeems the boredom of our expectation of the first acts of violence - which, when they arrive, only "hit all that is in seen without rhyme, reason or skill "- Moreira awkwardly tries to redeem her sudden ending by adding what seems to be overtaking just after, followed by an ironic and unlikely final scene the characters get married. No doubt the director has wanted to show the "banality of the evil" of the killers at low altitude in the neighborhoods, but he can not make sure that the characters, which he sees generically, come alive for us . And the structure of the film shows that he can not edit his material either. <br /> <br /> (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)
