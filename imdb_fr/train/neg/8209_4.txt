The acting, despite other criticisms, has been remarkably well done. Brad Pitt is very much a boring and obnoxious mountaineer. Other actor is fine. The story could have been fascinating, but it's missing a bit. We never really understand the characters presented and we do not really care. Thus, the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to attract this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I could not, despite all my chances, involve in this story. As a hardcore fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the five best actors of his generation), I was hoping to love this movie - and yet it left me cold. <br /> <br /> This could be a failure in itself, but I tend to point towards the creative end of this film - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me . It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good actor story, dramatic story, beautiful shot - it should have been beautiful. It was not. It's probably worth watching, just to make up your own mind - but do not wait too long, and you may not be as disappointed as me. Above all, it bothered me.
