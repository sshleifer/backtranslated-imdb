"Dominique" is one of those films for which the phrase "slow as molasses" must have been invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how often do we see Robertson coming down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is almost bought at the end by a surprising twist, which is unfortunately followed by a second turn that only succeeds in leaving a bad taste in our mouths. It's not a very nice film.
