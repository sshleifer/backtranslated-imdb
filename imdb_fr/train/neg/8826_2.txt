This (extremely) low budget movie is compared to the classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it is called Slasher Flick. First, let me tell you that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this one (this one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to become psychological by presenting the main character as someone who goes crazy, (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas. At work, it does not support how manufactured toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dressed as Santa Claus, he finally leaves for a slaughter. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no chills, no gore, no casting. With one exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is there. He is best known for playing alongside Tom Hanks as one of the guardians of the classic "The Green Mile". He still has to beat himself these days for ever accepting the role. He really is the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main role. (which is not so bad, but if you're overshadowed by a secondary character, you're not great either). And what about this strange ending? (You have to see it to believe it) "Christmas Evil" is downright boring, nothing happens and the illustrations are just misleading. This is not a slasher. Want to see a real Christmas slasher, discover the best of all time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
