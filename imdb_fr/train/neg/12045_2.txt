Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first article in IMDb, although I use it as a reference for a while. I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment. I hope not to upset you. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (all Greeks in fact) to analyze Omirus epos (and not Homers as we see everywhere), rhyme rhyme. If I remember correctly, it was Iliada (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment for me and my Greek compatriots on campus (I'm studying in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus 400 years after the war. Historians have spoken of the Trojan War around 1200 BC and that the real reason for the war was not Helen's beauty, but the crucial strategic position of Troy. That said, we can now understand that Omirus epos does not present real events (because it is not historically accurate), but that was never the goal of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this huge poem, we can question the very definitions of honor, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty, etc. The best and most educational part too was these protracted talks between the warriors before the battle. None of this has yet been revealed in "Troy". <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap for me, and for other intellectuals, my English, Finnish and German colleagues. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, Perfect Storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (the computer graphics did all the work), and yet it's the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that you'd better look at something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. This is a very expensive film in B. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
