"Captain Sky and the world of tomorrow" (a surprisingly incoherent title) is simply a bad movie. he has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special. Yes, the CGI wallpapers seem interesting, but the result is that everything is shot in a boring artistic vagueness. Plus, the movie uses music in the same way as, for example, "Gilligan's Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - it NEVER STOP. Terribly, just terrible. There are also no fresh ideas either, just gobs and gobs and ... etc., songs from old movies and series. There is no porter here, the movie seems to exist because it can. Save money and time Not entertaining at all.
