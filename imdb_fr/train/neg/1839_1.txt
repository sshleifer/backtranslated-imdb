I was anxious to put this film in my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after launching it, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. In fact, I watched the whole movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny ever happens. The box reads as if it would be really funny. The premises of the film sound good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this film be missed? Well .... it's missing! It's the least funny comedy I've ever seen. No one I spoke to thought it was even slightly funny. It's just a really bad movie. Believe me. Avoid it ... Avoid it!
