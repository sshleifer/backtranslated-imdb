Do not part with them. There are a lot of problems with this movie. It's cliché from the beginning, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start with the beginning: the characters. There's the annoying guy with no chance - giving Stiller another dick in his boring belt and no chance - the so-called wild, but in fact quite normal, loving interest - with whom Aniston plays well, but who did not ask really no effort - the fat, jovial friend, then the assortment of clichés: a boring Australian boring, a confident Spanish, etc. The scenario: the beginning is a little unusual, but then goes into the classic style of any movie, with each scenario as predictable as possible your average toc-toc joke. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character really seemed to come from nothing - like your regular play, the writers knew where it had started and where it had ended, but had not learned enough to properly tell the central part. Finally, the so-called "jokes" were nothing more than very diluted versions of standard gross humor; There was a regulatory scene of chunder, sweaty men, and so on. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact about this film is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing to do. Hamburg really prepared a dog dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have attracted the audience, but the taste left in the end was just as rancid. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This film may have Aniston has always chosen a better film between the seasons of Friends than the odious "Marci X" of Kudrow.
