As you can guess from my rankings and the title of this review, I do not like Johnny Test. Now, I think I know what people are going to say, "How do you know how bad it is, have you ever watched it?" Do not hold the candle up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first, because it's one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. Like the first two seasons or only the first season had a hand drawn animation. I thought it was a beautiful show to watch when it was drawn by hand, but then it went to flash animation and the quality deteriorated a lot. <br /> <br /> It's a blow in my eyes but let's look at the story of the show. It's way too much effort to look like Dexter's lab, but there are differences, because instead of a redheaded scientist, there are two and it's a woman. There is a dog talking (why?), And the parents' attitudes are somewhat reversed. I have others but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean to curse but I mean, I do not know if there is a limit for the words.). Everything else is there, even a DeeDee character, Johnny himself. Dexter does his best, but it seems like a heartless imitation. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Do you remember in the Dexters lab some of the jokes involved screaming? Yes, shouting may be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also had sneaky remarks that forced me to go back and check the joke. Johnny Test forgets all this, shouts 50% of the time and stops the music each time a stupid joke or lining appears. It's not comedy, it's stupid comedy (I know what some people think, is not it stupid comedians, comedy, watch this and Johnny Test, one after and you will laugh more at the first option.). Sometimes the jokes are based on odd situations that, like Chowder, drive me crazy. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies: Too weird, that does not mean that comedy makes you just think, "What am I watching?" <br /> <br /> This is striking in every respect. Do not watch this show if you have any respect for comedy.
