It's the worst brain waste I've ever known, ultra cheap, super stupid, stupid and useless, which I've ever seen, an incredible trash of instant cult status among the fans of the strange. If you think that Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you that it looks like "Citizen Kane" in relation to this one. Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Â¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's beyond evil, really. But if you are looking for this kind of incredible movies, this is for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great blaxploitation movies, but with "Star Creatures" they go down to level Z. Of course, my 1 out of 10 works upside down if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy who plays an Indian chef is awesome), so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
