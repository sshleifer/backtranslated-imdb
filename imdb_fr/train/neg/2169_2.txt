I usually appreciate Loretta Young's early films: her role at the time was light and windy, and she knew how to wear clothes. But this one is a loser, except for a funny second round of Glenda Farrell. Young is a young student who convinces her husband-writer (Paul Lukas) to become a championship bridge player. This is not the most cinematic game, and the long and talkative central part in which their wedding breaks is pretty much killing the film. <br /> <br /> There is however an interesting detail. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their decisive match, a series of quick shots show planes, trains, football games, even a flying diver, freezing in anticipation of the event. This is the first use of a freeze frame that I saw in an American movie. I would like the rest to be as inventive and funny.
