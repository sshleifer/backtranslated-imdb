The highlight of this film for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was clearly opposed to the guy and showed he could handle a non-traditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you love, admire and enthrall. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film, he appeared rather noble, his goal being to avenge the murders of his wife and his youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and a murderer before these murders. So, Hanks played a role I did not expect, and he did well. <br /> <br /> The good performance of Hanks aside, I certainly could not call it a nice movie. After an opening that I would call more enigmatic (I did not know very well where all this was going), the film turned into a very dark film about the complex relationships that Sullivan developed as a gangster - largely evoked by Rooney . (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mafia boss and tries to raise his own two sons and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After his eldest son witnessed a murder, the gang tries to kill him to silence him, gets the wrong son (and mother) and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange genre of movie about father / son ties. <br /> <br /> Even if it ends on a somewhat optimistic note (at least in the general context of the story), it is really very dark, which reinforces many scenes were shot in the past. darkness and torrential rains. I must admit that, although I enjoyed the performance of Hanks, the film as a whole did not hold me back. 4/10
