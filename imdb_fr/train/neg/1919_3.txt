I have read the book several times and this film does not follow exactly as it should. I could leave this slide, it's after all a movie. However, I have serious problems with the film frame. No one seemed to mention that this film and the book on which it is based are based on actual events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city on which this movie is supposed to be based. First of all, the "small" town that is referred to as the setting is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly, the film's decor is wrong. Grand Island is in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me crazy to see my hometown being treated so badly. It was a real event. Large parts of the city have been destroyed. In the book, they talk about cycling from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I imagine you could do it if you do not mind traveling 15 km each way.
