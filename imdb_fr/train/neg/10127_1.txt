This show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from British society as a whole. These are programs like this one and Blue Peter that claimed there was no class division in Britain. They always said things like; "Go to your loft and you might find this ..." or "Go to your garden that night and ..." - and we, the "disgusted" working-class kids who never had a "loft" and a "back garden" which was nothing more than a square meter of balcony on the 14th floor of an office building Public service broadcasting - yeah that's it! it was terribly depressing to see these stupid, middle-class children fend for themselves with pieces of old plastic having fun ... doing me a favor, and "why not" you're going to cut your wrists or do an overdose of coca on the money of "dad and mom" ... you make me sick
