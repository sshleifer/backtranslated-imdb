This film offers. The best thing is that the awkward teenager neighbor is trying to get away from the babysitter and, in the background, it looks like he has never been so close to a bike of his life then that he is trying not to fall. <br /> <br /> but this film does not stop there, but less than 5 minutes later, there is only one arm reaching out through a fence and a cooler taking out a beer. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical grilled dads, intrigues that lead nowhere and a former seaQuest actress with a Bluetooth cell phone help make this Saturday night at home a perfect day.
