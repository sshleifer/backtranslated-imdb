I saw this film years ago and I was impressed ... but I was only 12 years old. I recently watched it again and I want to recover that time. This movie is bad enough. Although I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (watch My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to see a GOOD movie in which he was ... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for bursts of laughter) and Burgess Meredith , this role. did / did nothing for their career. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is a racing driver who plans to drive his race car (which he had stored) across the country to California . One problem: the government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was OK (not the worst I've heard), but the execution was terribly failed.
