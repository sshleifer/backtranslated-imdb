The zombie revolt has no redeeming features. I'm tired of people claiming it's not that bad and the effects must have made more noise in 1936. I guess that's not true: it's not like the IQ had sharply increased over the past 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored by this garbage as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes and count the breaks between events, the dreadful choice of when you want to get closer to the point of view, the lugubrious edition that seems to provide two more seconds on each take to reduce the duration. Pay attention to the totally redundant dialogue: "I'm going to make tea / go outside / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes." This type of exchange occurs several times. Normally, I'd love that, being a huge fan of bad movies, but watch apathetic actors mumble their banal and tedious lines, and any desire to laugh at the film fades slowly. This kind of waste of selfless and bubbling time is far worse than energetic and imaginative mind-blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquering the Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than these more interesting films have an idea behind the entertainment. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw opens with stupor: it is bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly closed by boredom. Which is much worse.
