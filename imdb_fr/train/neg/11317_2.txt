This movement is about as bad as they come. I was obliged to give him a 2 for the landscape. There are many beautiful photos of the southwest, including Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the United States. It's also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, a scene with Kris and the girl was shot at a place called John Ford Point.
