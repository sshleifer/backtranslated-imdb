This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie with friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not a single friendly character. I could have more entertainment by looking static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the balance did not become negative. Avoid this movie at all costs.
