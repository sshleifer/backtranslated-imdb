It was a popular film probably because of its humor, its eventful history, its outsider character that closes all the big mouths, etc. but "white" like anything else would be considered racist by the PC police. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Woody Harrleson as White who turns out to be as good if not better than black basketball players, is interesting, as is his main counterpart, Wesley Snipes. Snipes had a lot of funny lines of writing, providing a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is the extreme blasphemy and leanness of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean and kind people in this movie. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by many blasphemies.
