I do not know who is to blame, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch. For his part, Ben Chaplin does a superior job - against all odds in my case. His character is too charming and attractive. but certainly not greedy enough to bear the foolishness of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems disconcerted by what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather by his orthopedic instability. There must be an element of credibility in his interest, but, as played, it is incomprehensible. Performance does not jibe. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, great despite all the efforts to derail them. The support cast is also a pleasure to watch. What a pity too, leads do not work together because the production is nice to watch.
