This film proves that you can not judge a movie based on the great illustrations on the DVD cover. This also proves that you should know more about a movie before you buy it (or find it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this film seems rather promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old man down the street) brings to college students a book full of witch spells that he leaves in their annual haunted house (where the film takes place). After that, there is alcohol, fights and soft core porn. Then, the action of the film finally takes place after one hour. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, unsuspecting and reminiscent of a soft-core porn. This movie is probably best seen by a group of friends who have nothing better to do because it's a good movie to make fun of. And for viewers for the first time, it's really fun to make predictions on the order of people who are dying.
