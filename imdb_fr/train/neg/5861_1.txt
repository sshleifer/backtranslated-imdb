I saw this film when it was released in 1978, when I was in the second year of high school. I made an appointment to see him. I did not "have any", needless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career has never been worse than she deserved after doing this horrible shit without mercy. In fact, little funny is not a pretty severe term: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You get away with the impression that any laughter that might have happened was beaten before it happened. It's not worth watching out of curiosity or because it's so bad, it's good. Even the MST3K gang would not have deserved to watch this! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
