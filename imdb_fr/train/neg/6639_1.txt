It's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. It is unfortunate that among the many films made each year in Romania, the worst of them are sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, action game or scenario is a waste of time and money. Rating: 0.02 out of 10
