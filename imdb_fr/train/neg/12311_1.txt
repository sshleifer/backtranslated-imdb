I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fogy of the baby boomer generation who grew up, stuck to a flickering black / white image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's Bilko product, offered by BBC2. I was wondering if I would have enjoyed Steve Martin's travesty if I had not seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I do not know - I might have it. <br /> <br /> Some of the other critics who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they have not seen the original. I can only invite you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If, after watching the original films Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig and Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, you still think that Steve Martin's movie is superior to a "2" - pint ....
