It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life !! It was stupid there was no conspiracy and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I have never seen such a bad game in my life! The only good sides of the film are all the most fashionable types (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people thought when they made this movie !! I did not even want to finish it all because you get to that point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching each other. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who heard about this movie and was interested to see it forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.
