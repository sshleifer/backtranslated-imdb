The powerful Morph Power Rangers appeared in 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese TV show sentai that began in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of action movies and Japanese series, one would think that this series would please me. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong anymore. What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with powerful rangers of morphine. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who get the power to become costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs that make up an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now, this postulate is wackier and more laughable than any other Transformers movie, but the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> It was followed by two bad, and I mean, very bad movie, and the actors of this series have completely disappeared from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have to choose, try looking at the Japanese Zyuranger series instead. <br /> <br /> And also, what happens with the long and terrible haircuts of the 1990s and all the earrings of the guys? It makes them all feminine!
