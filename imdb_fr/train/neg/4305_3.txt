I saw this movie some time ago on a video CD. <br /> <br /> I will first mention the positives. <br /> <br /> The film, at first, tries at least to appear that it is not biased, like not showing a character in black and the other in white. The two main characters are friends and coexist very well in a country and an economy that does not prosper and that fails at the same time. Their families gather and organize parties. They practice their favorite sport, sports rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after 15 minutes, the plot runs up against the fork. The public should believe that, for some unknown reason, these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on the path of conflict. Of course, the script adds to the TV footage that the characters seem to watch live broadcasts in English, but the clips are from 1993, not 1992, at the beginning of the war. <br /> <br /> History, the 1990 elections, the people who provoked the war are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, candidate for the presidency and head of the 2nd party of the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP was to have the presidency in 1992, but a coup d'etat took place in January. The Bosnian Democratic Islamic Action Party took full control and organized a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man strangely absent from "STTH". He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf" in which he declared: "It is not possible that there is a peace or coexistence between" the Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions". <br /> <In 1990, he lost the IDAP elections to "moderate pro-Yugoslavia" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who had worked with Christian Serbs during the civil war and who treated his followers as brothers. Abdet was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election but seized the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The events from above are missing from the film, but it is the factual events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems of accessories. The Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet helmets that they did not use. In addition, one of the soldiers was holding a World War II M-1944 rifle used only by the USSR, not Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and the writers had a chance, but they chose to rewrite the story.
