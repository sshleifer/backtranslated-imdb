If you look at this without having a clue what it is about in this story, surprise awaits you. Even then, the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather healthy scenario, but the film itself has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The synopsis tells of an obsessed mountaineer, whom you will see as the prologue before the opening credits and the crawl of the text, which tells you about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to oneself, which causes problems of flashing light), where its inhabitants are immortal a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and notice all the people of this climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him by alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man. <br /> <br /> is a repetitive animation that a 5 year old could produce. Have shapes created, although the merit is back to the stop motion style and have it go through a steep loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. The Chonopolis (if this term exists) really love their clubs and their balls, playing constantly evoke this magic sphere, and playing a busy day before releasing it in the world "other". It does not get better either, when the man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotically boring and sleep-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Fortunately the run time is shorter than advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 reported. Although dated, its dull colors, its non-existent history, its scratchy soundtrack and its repetitive images will not seduce any fan. Do not waste time.
