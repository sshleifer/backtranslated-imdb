I'm sure that people watching this move outside of Britain will make this movie a fun watch, but for someone from the UK, the mistakes are painful. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, Elijah Wood has a tube at the bank station, which was put in the trash. He tells his sister that he meets, "What happened here" and she answers "Oh, Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town ... they are part of the city, they must not go! And if the Tottenham fans wanted to fight in the last place on earth, they would do it at Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are several other similar ones. mistakes but the biggest fault for me is the actor who plays the main hooligan. He clearly decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mock-ney that made my ears bleed. This was accentuated by the fact that the rest of his band was talking like West Ham fans would expect. This mistake made him amazing in the role and really ruined the movie.
