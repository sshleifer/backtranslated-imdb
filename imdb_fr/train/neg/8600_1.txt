In the whole story on a budget. this film must be one of the worst. Certainly, there are humorous aspects in the film, but in general it was just awful. I can not understand who would not be able to run a pile of slugs. I mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only interesting part of this movie is the close attempt of a slug to bite a man's finger. It was rather amusing.
