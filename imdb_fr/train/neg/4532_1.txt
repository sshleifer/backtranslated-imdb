My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say that I will not let her watch the new episodes on TV because I find ALL the characters annoying. Baby bear and telly? OMgosh, how boring and useless blabber can he think of someone for his skits? Elmo? Give some rest to all the children do not like it, again, boring and teach nothing to my child. Mr. Noodle? what to reject. I think the only time I shot the "new" show for her, she and I had been stupider than before. The show definitely took a bad turn. I remember the Yip Yips, the latest news from Kermit, 1-2 2 Little dolls, Mumford the magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL skits from the old school SS Sesame Street have suffered a direct blow from boredom and dumbness since. Jim Henson died in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, amusing and interactive skits it was used to. I find the new versions unbearably boring and full of useless and non-educational blabber. Sincerely, South American producers / writers, you have yet another cartoony show where parents can sit in front of non-creative, unexercised children, so they can take off their shoes. By producers / writers: I suggest you remove the old muppets and start recording similar content to the first Sesame Street. Lord knows I really do not want my child to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
