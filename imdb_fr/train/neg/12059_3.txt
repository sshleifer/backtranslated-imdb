The 80s were not very kind to Charles Bronson. Beginning with "Death Wish II" in 1982 and ending with this truly awful film of 1989, Bronson's writers seemed to be trying to outdo each other by their rudeness. "D.W. II" left little imagination in his description of the rape and suicide of the daughter of Bronson's character (a rape and murder of his maid were also shown with disgusting details). "10 am to midnight" was the kind of hateful movie that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeems on this subject. Other films like "The Evil That Men Do" and the last "Death Wish" films of this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their sincere descriptions of brutality and vengeance. I do not know if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) have had the trouble to show an old and old Bronson destroying, destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or whatever, but their mediocre craftsmanship (and their scripts Terrible) Films usually destroy the little energy they could generate. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is pretty well done but really takes over in the cinematic misery. In this film, Bronson: sodomizes a pervert john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes some incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things that I have fortunately forgotten. The gang rape of a Japanese girl (thankfully, it was off-screen, although very implicit). <br /> <br /> What did people think about when they shoot this movie? What was Bronson thinking about when he decided to ruin his career with these horrendous movies? For those who are interested in his best films, discover most of the movies he made in the 60s and 70s, such as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From noon to 3 years", "It once upon a time in the West "," Red Sun "," The Great Evasion "," The Seven Wonderful "," Rider in the Rain ", etc., etc.
