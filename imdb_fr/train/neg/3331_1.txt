Dreck about three beautiful women in California who are going to cover a festival (or something). All hotels are booked, so they have to spend the night in a scary old house. What they do not know is that there is a scary inhabitant who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. "Horror" movie boring, useless and totally stupid. Bach and his two friends are certainly beautiful but the film itself is dull, drab! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are completely empty. The final "revelation" is predictably predictable and there is no blood or blood that can interest you throughout the course. Free female nudity is expected, but it's not enough to save this. Boring, useless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
