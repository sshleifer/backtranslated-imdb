It seems everyone can make a movie nowadays. It's as if all you needed was a camera, a group of people to do your casting and your team, a screenplay, a little money and a bit of money to make a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often, these kinds of low-budget movies turn out to be a failure. The shelves of video stores are filled with these movies. It's not even guilty pleasures, it's just celluloid waste that's better to forget. Troma Entertainment is known for its trashy cinema, but most of its films are gold. However, some of the films they released had nothing to do with filmmaking, and some, like Nightmare Weekend, did not deserve any form of release. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Retailers do their best with lousy material. Some involuntary hilarity. Moves at a good pace (should 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: dreadful writing, which includes a putrid dialogue and innumerable terrain holes. Illuminated, especially the night scenes and the end that you can not distinguish at all. It does not make sense. Badly marked Cheap and very dated effects. Total absence of character development and you will not worry about anyone. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's missing in this area and is not the least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting is happening. Loaded with unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I did not expect it to be a forgotten jewel, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie of all time, but it's a serious candidate. Troma should have let this film rot instead of releasing it. Do not make the same mistake as me and let your curiosity seduce you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
