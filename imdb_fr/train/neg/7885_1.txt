I think we need to keep religion out of government and from movies. When I want a sermon, I go to church, but I do not want a movie. Some supernatural themes do not bother me (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can get it!), But this film contained so many sermons that I got really upset. The owner reminded me of witches as seen in other movies. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a stupid end: the hero entered the meeting and shouted to all those old men, and that broke the spell. If only life was so simple. I think that when the movies are so stupid, they must be distributed with a warning: DANGER! The preaching contained here!
