Nu Image, UFO and others produce for SCI FI movies with a budget of about $ 2 million. Some have many effects, others, recognizable cast, others, for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines originally claimed that the budget of this film was $ 20 million, but it is unfortunately obvious that this film was produced at $ 750,000, or considerably less. Few decors are used, a number of scenes are shot on a green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is misdirected, poorly executed and misdirected, but because many of us have been following the evolution of this production for some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this film during its first announcement joined the legions of those of whom PT Barnum speaks.
