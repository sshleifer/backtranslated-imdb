This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with horror movies in the jungle is that there are always too many people walking (in the jungle, at the top of a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to save time. The film is worth the detour for the naked and laughable native zombie, with its large, bloody, protruding eyes, which is always accompanied on the soundtrack by a difficult breathing and a lot of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be thrilled by the bad dubbing in English, the free feminine flesh and the very stupid makeup work on native monsters and extras. For a zombie / cannibal movie, it was pretty light, but I probably did not see a full version.
