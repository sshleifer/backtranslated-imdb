Who did the research for this film? It takes place in Baghdad in 2004, but all soldiers wear ACUs and wear all the universal camouflage clothing. Nobody wore this kind of clothes in 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie while being deployed abroad and I can say that the overwhelming feeling of the public was WTF? This film made no sense, the characters came and went without explanation, and people were doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic. It fails miserably, but it's difficult. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone had a lot of random ideas, chewed and swallowed them, then threw up a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I still do not know why I sat through it all. GI Joe was the one who really made you think of this. STAY AWAY!
