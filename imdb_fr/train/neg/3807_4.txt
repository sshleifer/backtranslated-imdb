Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Woody's many movies, obviously his late 70's masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late 80s drama and from the early 90s (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands and Wives) in fact, I even liked some of her more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but it was catastrophic. I thought it could not be worse than Match Point last year, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> He was lazily plotting - essentially a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes removed - Woody seems to be about to go out too, hiding most of his Hilarious lines and slogans I mean with all due respect ... until all this becomes unbearable. <br /> <br /> I know most of the actors are queuing to work with him, but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than that - and Woody should play more behind the camera in the future, if he has any sense behind him. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic not to have so many great Woody movies to compare it to - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should be say one day before becoming an industry joke. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
