Who wrote this? A guy named John Cohen. I guess that's the first scenario he's worked on. Someone should have told him that you are supposed to write a dialogue that sounds like something that someone could actually say. <br /> <br /> And who directed this film? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell away from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you could actually shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, that it would look real and you would not have to simulate it with a blue screen for no reason. I might also have wanted to let him know that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope he learned that lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course, she can not act. Damn, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she plays in this movie. Oh, wait, it was produced by his father. Ok, that's why she had the role. That's really the only reason I can think. <br /> <br /> Should I be surprised that this is bad? No. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would do it if they saw as much as me. I mean, you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic movie. Think of a good film by Woody Allen, this film is as bad as it is good. This is the anti-Annie room. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did not pay to see him. I stopped watching for ten minutes because I could not continue. No doubt I would have left the theater earlier. In fact, I'm wondering how many of the people who saw him per theater stayed and watched everything. The film starts ridiculously bad, then goes to the point of becoming so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, towards the end of the first act, you realize that it will only get worse, and that you have to either leave or commit suicide. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie falls into the category of being so bad that it should be used instead of boarding the water at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer waterboarding.
