Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (Bette Davis) is engaged to the stupid egotist Allen Brice (Jack Carson who seems lost). His father (Eugene Palette) is determined to end the marriage and is kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney, Seriously). They crash into the desert and hate each other but (sigh) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to get a high rating from commentators here just because Cagney and Davis are involved. They were both brilliant actors but they were known for their NOT comedy dramas and this movie shows why! The scenario is simply horrible - there is not a sincere laugh in the whole movie. Cagney and Davis fall first into a cactus (it's done THREE TIMES!). Only their considerable talents prevent them from being completely humiliated. As they are both doing their best with ugly material. Cagney does her best with her lines and Davis screams every line, but that does not work. Carson has this "devil" look on his face throughout the movie (probably because the emotions of his characters change in seconds). Only Palette, with her distinctive voice and higher readings, manages to spark some smiles. But, overall, it was boring and not laughing - a real chore to accomplish. This gives two stars only for the acting of Cagney and Davis and a beautiful cinematography, but really - it is not worth to be seen. Cagney and Davis have hated this movie in the last few years and you can see why.
