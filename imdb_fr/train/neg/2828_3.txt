There seems to have been a lot of movies like this one released in the '70s. And the fact that I do not remember the title of any of them is a measure of their impact. These are what novelists call "boiler boilers". These are little more than a way to keep movie stars in front of the public. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to have buttocks on the movie seats. All the hero's tastes are taken into account. Although we suspect that most of the spectators are still gone, disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply abandoned, and I wonder if stars with so much money and such a reputation can be so desperate or missing in a good way. This kind of film hardly adds gilding to a resume. Sometimes actors may have to choose their director instead of the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it would be shit, even at the beginning. This ridiculously absurd jaunty-jazz themed music, which also spread whenever an incidental noise was needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of the Muzak elevator. Who imagined using a jazz band when a scene depicts the misty jungles of Central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees as a backdrop? Definitely a serious blunder. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and its results would have enough atmosphere and tension to raise my mark by two points. This director should have bothered to watch "Lawrence of Arabia", or even the westerns of Sergio Leone; he could have learned a few things. But again, probably not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock has played the theme of the woman who disappears in his movie "Frantic". It was then redone with as much panache as Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion surrounding his loss and the tension of the pursuit were palpable. Here, while Michael Caine might have to use some brains and bravery, Rex Harrison kept coming out of nowhere like a cunning old genius, to get him back on track every time the story stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the photography was pretty good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then, the mute music has to whistle and blow to atoms the little atmosphere that it has created. <br /> <br /> Theater class And, of course, players have to fight for a jazz accompaniment - as you do. <br /> <br /> And that's about as many comments as this element deserves. Except to say that the script was also pretty miserable. <br /> <br /> Stick to your hobby. Even if it contained your favorite movie stars, you will also be disappointed.
