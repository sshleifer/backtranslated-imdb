I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a really awful movie. The scenario, the staging and the game were just as bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a smart and provocative film, but he did not do it. I squirmed in my seat during the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the center of the film? Where was what in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was shabby and wasting my money. Do not see this movie.
