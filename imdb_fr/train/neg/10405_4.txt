The fourth movie "Tremors" goes back in time, until 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which was at the time "Rejection, Nevada". At the beginning of the story, seventeen miners are killed by the terrible "Graboids". Some of the characters in the current "Tremors" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal. The most obvious is the always recurring Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept firearms. then, he hires the banditologist Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot them with "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This takes a little time to get used to - as it takes place in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the monster from the original movie "Graboids". These quieter "hand dragons" are not nearly as terrorist as their counterparts "Tremors" (1990). Therefore, in this movie, the characters spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. And it was odd that the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) not immediately mobilize the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
