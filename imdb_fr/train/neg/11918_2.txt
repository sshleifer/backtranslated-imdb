It seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie, I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that Dimple's acting talent Kapadia and Deepti Naval was really commendable, but despite all the efforts, this film fails to effectively convey a meaningful message, which seems to be what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point is brief and the end seemed a little unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in this respect but different films of real life end in about 2 hours and the end should leave the audience satisfied, if that was actually the intention of the director. This is missing in this respect and that is what disappoints me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that worries me is the national stereotyping of American characters: they all seem to be cut in the same block. . It seems to me that most of the American characters in Indian English films are based on how the Indians themselves perceive Americans and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring a sense of depth or complexity to no American in the movie. <BR/> <br /> These two aspects together form a disappointing story.
