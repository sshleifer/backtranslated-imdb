My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror and sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this film is awful, I think so. Everything is there, the acting, the camera work, the story, the costumes, is so cheerful and small budget but that's what makes it so good. I think that in one scene, the actors seemed to walk on the spot. I really hope that those who made this movie were not serious, because if they did, it would be just sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies to make fun of them, I recommend this one.
