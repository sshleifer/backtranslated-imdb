This film was awful. The end was absolutely horrible. There was no plot in the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent in the movie was the acting by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not do justice to their acting performance. If the scenario had been close to capturing a half-decent story, it would be interesting to watch it. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely ruined by a dreadful story ... or lack thereof. Throughout the film, it only remained to wait for something to happen to make the film ... and a movie ... but not just a bottomless dialogue between characters for what was ultimately no reason. It was nothing more than a joint dialogue that would have taken place at that time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was the way Robert DuVall portrayed a disheveled old man, senile, drunk. Nothing dignified happens during the entire movie, including the end. When the movie finished, I was stunned ... amazed that I sat around the whole movie until something interesting happened to make the film worthy of interest. It never happened! The troupe of characters suddenly began to roll, showing that the film was really finished and I realized that I had just lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie without any plot or meaning. It was not even a story. The entire film takes place in one day. That's all. It was a day in the life (and death) of some southerners of a plantation. How much history can take place in one day (other than the day of film formation)? The acting performances of all the actors were excellent, but they were completely ruined by such a disappointment of a movie ... if you can even call it a movie.
