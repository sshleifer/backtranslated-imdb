This series gets 2 stars only because it staged part of Dickens' Bleak House and someone may read the book. Contrary to what one probably thinks, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clumsy and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'm going to interrupt and answer all the people who say, "I have not read the book, so I do not have to take the advice of this guy because he bases his ratings on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of her mediocre play, whether you've read the book or not. For his part, Denholm Elliot is a fair Jarndyce (although too old). The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book, but because the different lines of the plot and the characters do not combine to form a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and captivating entertainment. It's dull and flat. If you really want Bleak House, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that producers, etc., leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television stifles Dickens' genius as evidenced by his ingenious intrigues and his unforgettable characters.
