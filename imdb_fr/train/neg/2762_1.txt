... there is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to watch him last night. It's just a small theater, but there is usually a decent amount of people. Not this time! My husband and I were the only ones watching Dragon Wars last night! We now know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the GC was good, but that was it. The acting, the scenario and the dialogue, the staging, the editing, etc. were terrible! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about the seriousness of the situation, because it reminded us of the mighty powerful Rangers of Morphin, Godzilla, the Fight of Mortals AND the Lord of the Rings. It was as if we were expecting Rita and Lord Zed to represent the commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not just introduce legions of dino / dragon / lizard things loaded with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide range of characters, but he presents them and develops them into 3 movies, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The transitions of scenes are horrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even if it was an overly simple plot, I found myself lost in the conspiracy holes. because of the poorly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have bought back some of the value of the film ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... even though he did not know her for a very long time anyway. He did not seem too upset to stay in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back. For God's sake, we could not know where he was or how he had arrived there, but if he was not angry, we should not be. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why the dress that Sarah's mind was as if she had borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... the 3 main characters of the hero are reincarnations brought back to complete the work. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does it too. So why is Ethan getting fucked? He left alone, without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him back. What is he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And if he goes home, does he go back to work? He should have received the same pity as the other heroes for the murder of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money on this movie. We stayed until the end because we paid for it, but as soon as the credits were granted, we left.
