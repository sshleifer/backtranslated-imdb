I sometimes enjoy really ugly films ... those that sometimes result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for some reason, it turns out to be a disaster. Movies such as "Attack of Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 of Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Destiny" and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard that this film "Rachel's Attic", was considered by many to be the worst film of the decade, of course, I MUST see it. <br /> <br /> I regret my decision. This movie is beyond the bad .... it's so bad that it's not even as nice as the usual bad movie. Play, film, write a screenplay, etc. is even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is absolutely horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "game" is laughable ... it's a total mess for everyone. time and money. At least the porn movie has porn to break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy hugging a rotten apple and an infusion of "Mad Hatter". <br /> Illumination is non-existent. Many "scenes" take place in almost total darkness, which is probably just as good. The "screenwriter-director" (David Tybor, I use the terms vaguely) tries to make scenes with perverse scenes of bondage ... but the results would be laughable if they were not so pathetic. There is nudity, but it is of such an abyssal quality that it really acts as a sexual suppressor. I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and faults of this really horrible film mess. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid this shipwreck. I know that despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you can still be tempted to see if this trash is really as bad as I claim ... but trust me on this ... it's Even worse than what I said, and you will absolutely regret the experience (and spending if you waste your money on buying or renting).
