My thoughts on the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was happy with the stimulation, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, a little bland. Ground? It was bad. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to be a crap of the new age more than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not better described. This creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and give life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's something that bites me a bit too. We have here a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they use it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to ask one of the characters to ask him, <br /> <br /> "Okay, so what?" (or something similar) I could not hear it very well because of the crowd getting up immediately and taking a break for the exit. It was a "OK ... it was just entertaining enough to sit here during the whole movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!" type of output. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod gently. Any thoughts as to, "what's the point of this?" You will suck in disbelief and make you watch the sign of the exit with envy. <br /> <br /> Ok ... the SPOILERS follow. <br /> <br /> A scientist therefore creates "the Machine" which is able to create another intelligent, robotic life. Perverse humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave his intelligence to the Machine, but not his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine goes Skynet on the collective ass of humanity and eliminates all life on earth, to slowly die out. However, the scientist manages to survive and create sock puppets. Each of them contains a part of the scientist's soul. <br /> <br /> The last, the 9th, wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He encounters another like him, the # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, the # 2 is captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. No. 9 gets closer to himself and goes to the rescue of No. 2 <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 note that there is a corresponding hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life ... removing the soul of Player # 2. The movie then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to save his compatriots. <br /> <br /> They finally succeed and destroy the machine. They free the souls of their fallen friends, who climb into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Not at all. Why on earth did the scientist want to divide his soul into nine homunculi? What did he accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? <br /> <br /> Why does he expect nine small critters to succeed when nothing has happened? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... at least, it would have seemed that he would have had a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the machine by the machine, then destroy the machine and release the souls to bring life back to Earth? Why not just wait for the machine to go out and bring back life without all the rest of the crazy steps?
