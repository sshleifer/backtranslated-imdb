In 1972, after the departure of his wife, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a beauty queen, adorable, long-haired, long-haired, is supposed to fill a void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became definitive, Linda was already in place as a living girlfriend and traveling companion of the legendary artist until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a keen look about their love story and their company. Linda takes care of all her heart of the needs and desires of her lover. And even support his medicine to swallow by the handle and present him his own love story with the valium. Sometimes this film is hard and dark in heart; a very unattractive look at the "king" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely awful like Elvis. It is not interesting to act to the maximum. Stephanie Zimbalist misses Linda's elegance, but does her job very well. The secondary cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this notice stop you from checking it. For most Elvis fans I conferred, this is not a favorite presentation.
