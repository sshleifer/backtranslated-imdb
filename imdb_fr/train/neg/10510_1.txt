oh my god where to start ...... bad game .... characters that do not interest you ... are they american or british ... they seem to think they are in america, because c is elsewhere huge forest in the midlands ... <br /> <br /> a big mistake ... they drive all night through these woods ... unless they walk around without stopping, they would have been in Scotland in the morning ... when the whiner hits the poor wandering woman ... <br /> <br /> and her mobile do not work .. so what do they do ... separate, of course, make it easier to pick ... then three go in search of a house that could be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay to "take care" of the unconscious woman ... then what are they doing rather than putting her at ease, banging her head, covering her or even moving her from the flowery path, they just leave her lying on the wrong path while they Do not make a fire at 100 meters ... and all the time they have a camper van they could put it in ... <br /> <br /> and on the excited angels who are supposed to have so much desired the human race that they were ejected from heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? does he have sex with men they meet? ......... no, they bite huge pieces and pull out their heads ... I think they do not understand anything ... <br /> These are not gorgeous former sexually private angels, they are cannabal vampires ... and for tom savini by saying how breathtaking they are ... they have a good body but nothing special in front. the main role was much prettier than these so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> 2.30 Â£ waste film waste from my local library ...
