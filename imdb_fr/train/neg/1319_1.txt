Someone has probably heard of Alberto Tomba. A former policeman, a former champion of the sky and, now, a TERRIBLE actor. "Alex Ariete" was supposed to be a television "mini-series", but Italian television itself refused to broadcast the film on its channels. Now it's a ridiculous movie. The scenario is just hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5-year-old kid job. But what really captivates you is the amateur acting game: Alberto Tomba, who was not credible as a policeman himself, plays terribly a completely idiotic character: an Italian police officer specialized in special operations who break the doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-guy will try to save the life of a nice girl (a "little" Italian TV show, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice but absolutely incompetent. Lose this one and do yourself a favor. A film that shames the Italian film industry: only John Travolta in Earth Attack has come closer.
