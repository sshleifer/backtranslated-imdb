Warning: This notice contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost unbelievably bad. Note I said, "almost". This is nothing but many random scenes related in a loose history attempt. The protagonists (you can not call them "heroes") shoot at innocent bystanders for their food and steal them for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turning point for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the wicked (who is only shirtless and not naked as other critics claim) is killed early, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of torture by the public.) I can not not to stop thinking about this animal. abuses have been committed many times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in MST3K mood, you may find it controllable, but you can usually forget about it. Go and rent the original Conan DVD instead.
