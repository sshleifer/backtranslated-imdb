Those who have already written the two or three laudatory critics have either participated in the making of this film, either a term used roughly or a bank launch, and if it was the case, I would like to recover my seven dollars! The actors, again the word vaguely used, are awful, in fact, almost none of them have done anything yet that is a relief. The landscape and everything about these shouts, we had $ 7 to work and a day to do it. Was this film filmed in the backyard? Everything about this project says, small budget. The actors at best were D list. Do not waste your time, unless of course you want to recover it and try to recover the rental. The prominent villain looks like this 70's punk who ended up marrying his grandmother, Dummee Moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the most returned movie with a sad comment attached. Even when renting 99 cents, this film takes dust. Someone really had to have favors. This is a super stinker and I give him 10 turds.
