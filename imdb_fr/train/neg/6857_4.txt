This "crazy comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, actors TRY very hard to try an essentially non-funny scenario. And, therefore, that is not going anywhere. The idea that a woman discovers she was pregnant after a quick divorce is just not so funny. And then, when Cooper runs away with the baby because he does not want it to be adopted, it sounds terribly ridiculous and it's really hard to turn that into a comedy. It's really too bad, because the actors were more capable than the scenario and I found myself bored by all the mess. Since Cooper has produced so many GOOD comedies, I recommend you see them instead.
