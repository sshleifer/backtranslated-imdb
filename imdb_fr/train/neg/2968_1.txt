By ignoring (if possible) the fastidiously free smoking of marijuana (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films), the distribution of this film gives a reasonably credible performance. It's far as it goes. The rest is just horrible. The plot is overloaded with "wow" symbols that are supposed to look good on the movie but go nowhere. A glaring example is the giant fishing float, obviously left by a municipal parade and offered by the local cannery. It was too tempting to waste what we hoped was a free, yet irrelevant accessory. The fishery is given a superficial and unexplained cleaning at some point, but that's where it ends. to escape from his past, but his escape to what? She had a good deal where she was, especially given her visual impairment and her infinite patience, loving and caring, and taking charge of her understanding, a young tutor. <br /> <br /> Alan's characterization. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of union steward but "rages" to his co-workers by becoming a supervisor of a nasty multinational - hissing! hiss! As a supervisor, Alan does the boss's dirty work. He implements layoffs until surprise surprise, the entire plant is shut down and Alan himself remains like a pathetic failure and jobless. No areas without clich√©s here, buddy! Not only that, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you have had. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, do not ask for details. How important is shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why does not the hotel, where the couple make love, think that someone is illegally entering one of their larger rooms and, among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly soiled? - in a spectacular way. Summarize this film in one word: avoid, avoid, avoid.
