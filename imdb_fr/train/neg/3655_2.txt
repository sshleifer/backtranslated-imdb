Oh dear, I think it's maybe the craziest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, it's one of the ultimate B movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, it's too common for that. I got it on VHS, in a bin full of old rental videos in my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I can quote the press text: "In the seventeenth century in Japan, a samurai lived His name was Mayeda, he then undertook an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 muscats the king of Spain while at sea, a violent storm engulfed their precious gold intended to buy arms and cost them the life Mayeda has to face all the difficulties to survive and to preserve the destiny of his beloved Japan. " He then continues: "An epic multi-million dollar adventure on three continents" <br /> <br /> I must have seen a different movie. It was not an epic, and it was certainly not a multi-million dollar thing. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is actually the crazy adventures of Mayeda (Sho Kosugi) who speaks English. He's not really a shogun, but it's not important. What is important is that it makes a really cool impression of John Cleese's repeated accusations of the only "Monty Python and Holy Grail" castle, and of his ability to pass serious scenes to show his mental powers of samurai. Impressive. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is the accented accent of Sho Kosugi. The film may be missing almost everything that makes a good film, but it catches up with some of the most cheesy lines ever made, with the coolest accent ever created. And honestly, do you really want something else? You can fast forward "Shogun Mayeda" to the end and replay the last line of Kosugi again and again. The tape will probably be worn out before you get tired of this line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very very cheesy.
