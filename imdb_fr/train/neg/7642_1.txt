Everyone seems to be excited about the subject and not really noticing how the film was shot. The deaf and dumb is fine, the underdog wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the film is overall average. I think the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real event. I'm sure the film could have been made more interesting. The songs are simply crushed in there, and I literally had to follow the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good interpretation, though. Observable.
