Madison is not that bad - if you like simplistic, non-offensive, "family friendly" fares and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., get ready to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have long commented on the movie's filmic character and its penchant for using all the cluttered sports clich√©s of the book. I do not need to repeat what they said. What I missed was unfortunately the sense of enthusiasm for the unlimited hydro-electric races in the "glory years" (which many would say in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats traveling the six course abreast, although it was clear that the restored versions (hat congratulations to the volunteers of the Hydroplane and the museum of the race ) were smashed at a reduced speed. But where was the sound? The great passion of the old hydros was the deafening roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, whose designers had not imagined the idea, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You have not heard it, you feel it. Real Hydro fans know exactly what I'm talking about. There is none of this in Madison. Instead, each race scene is buried under what is supposed to be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> And then, there are the close-ups of the pilots, rolling slowly and comfortably in the cockpits, as if they were relaxing in the last luxury limousines, sometimes taking the time to smile maliciously while they were thinking of the best way to thwart the poor hero of their hometown. Or, in a particularly ridiculous shot, take the time to spot Jake Lloyd saluting "Rocky" from a bridge pillar. In reality, an unlimited number of drivers were wearing bullet-proof vests to minimize the blows they suffered when the boats hit the depth of the water at a speed exceeding 150 mph. <br /> <br /> As one of the commentators put it, "the sport deserves better than that." <br /> <br /> Finally, since another user mentioned anachronisms, I'll add one: the Seattle photo shows Kingdome and Safeco Field. Neither existed in 1971
