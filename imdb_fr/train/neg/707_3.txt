"Celebration of Toussaint?" Or...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Has the script and theme of All Saints Day been removed? <br /> <br /> What a mess of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the furthest connection with the "Feast of All Saints". There is also nothing in the story of "All Souls Day" to which the term refers. Why bother using this title if you never intend to include a script or theme on "All Saints Day" or "All Saints Day"? <br /> <br /> embarrassing scenario and amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such talent with this clunker? The writing is so amateurish that characters who have known each other all their lives engage in long and long speeches on their history to the delight of the audience. Not at all the way people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What did the director think? <br /> <br /> The staging is just as bad! Forced and deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character shouts "Take your hands off me" and no one touches it! The most misguided scene, however, is the incredibly disproportionate battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a very fictitious battle scene <br /> <br /> There are so many deaths in the most fake battle scene. It sounds like a Saturday night skit! You can see extras waiting for their signals to cross the camera. Everyone plays his death scene like a 4th grade boy - exaggerating every little breath. The blood on the victims of the battle is so excessive and negligently applied that it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just threw straight red lines at the suits. <br /> <br /> This whole battle scene is like a parody of a nerdy war movie. You almost expect people like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride and deliver the replica. <br /> <br /> Who in real life would behave this way ?! <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous writing, directing and casting are at the center of the stage: <br /> <br /> A little girl stands under the body of her hanged father - who is terribly mutilated and literally dripping blood forms his gaping wounds. Even a fool knows he's dead! Still, she repeats - very monotonously again and again "Dad, dad ..." while watching someone off screen. She delivered it with about as much credibility and passion as one would expect from a non-acting kid who was telling what was going on for the cameras all day long. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child had acting skills, the scene is completely incredible. The girl would not even have been in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she stands serenely there !! His natural instinct would have pushed the child to scream and be terrified, deviating from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be horrified or laugh ... ?! <br /> <br /> A particularly naughty detail, which gives the scene a SNL satire tone, is the hanging father, with huge hook by the mouth and cheek. It looks like a fish on a hook! Unintentionally amusing details make the entire scene a fake and an idiot. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another fun detail is that you see a central character - the mother of the little girl - at the end of the stage and in the next scene, which occurs 20 years later, she even ! She is still young and beautiful, and is now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost shut down the movie there because the direction and writing was obviously horrible - but I tried to hold it because I wanted to see the sets of Louisiana and I love all the actors. I do not know what these good actors thought when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the audience targeted for? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and misbehaved violence in the opening scene are strangely out of place with the soap opera tone that follows. It's also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems to target romantic novels read by women. Bizarre inconsistency in the tone!
