Dahmer, a confused young man. Dahmer, a confusing film. Of course, I drank a few beers while watching the movie, but that does not explain why I was so bored of this movie. a beginning and an end, the only thing that makes sense in the film is the explanatory text at the beginning and the end of the film. The film, which would be the movie, is just boring pictures and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see murders, everything is just a heap of innuendo. Sometimes you even have the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming of everything, but you know that's not the case because it's based on a true story and that's what happened, at least in the together. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
