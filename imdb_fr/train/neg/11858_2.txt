I am a fan of Matthew Modine, but this film - on which I came across the cable - is totally meaningless. I see that the screenwriter and the director were identical, so there was no one to check his worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given the high cost of filming in New York these days, I wonder how it was done. And if you're wondering why I watched it, it came out after a movie I like on the cable and I left it while I was working on the computer. This is not a very demanding image!
