I really have nothing new to add but I just felt compelled to comment on this bag. So, here is: <br /> <br /> atrocious. I'm browsing my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for the tenth time. It's really very painful, but it was the next one on the list ... You can see there's a tiny nucleus of a film buried under the heap of "Hobgoblins" but it just could not go out. All that concerns this film is 4th. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the ... ahhhh forget it. I can watch a piece of shit like "Dr. Z's Blood Waters" (aka "Zaat") over and over and over again and almost without any perverse effects (I like that actually, actually, it will be on the TCM later this month) October 2009) but "Hobgoblins" is an entirely different ball game. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is maybe now it's about 12 hours after the end of the movie, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and dry sandwiches, my drugs, and yet the ersatz "New Wave" dance music to which Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman frolicked in the living room was ALWAYS UNDER MY HEAD. This torture will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, is not it?
