By resuming its long title, the film finds the way to approach the mark of 90 '. The beautiful scenery is here with everything that has made Hamer production a trademark, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent negligence. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words. So there is nothing unexpected and nothing is worth more than 5% of your attention. <br /> <br /> The realization is heavy as a direct transfer of the on stage, the actors are usually stiff like wax figures (ok, it's a feature of Hamer, but sometimes it's better in the package as a whole). My conclusion: this film is a junk, not worth the time I spend this evening. Eternal life is a boring affair and I should have hoped that those in charge of programming at the Cinematheque would know more.
