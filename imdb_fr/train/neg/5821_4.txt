As others have noted, it should have been an excellent Hammer-style film, and it seems to me that's how most of the actors were asked to play it ... but the story is so heavy, so little rhythmed and filled with Many monotonous monologues (poor Timothy Dalton is struggling with most of them) are too exaggerated and important. This is an unusually weak performance of Dalton, although he quietly describes the climatic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. The only actor who is doing really well is Patrick Stewart which is a very welcome sight. Freddie Francis was perhaps an excellent filmmaker, but he was an ugly director.
