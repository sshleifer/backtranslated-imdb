I doubt it is a cult film. I liked Gram Parsons and I did not expect much from this film and I still have less. What could have been smart and moving was campy. It was devoid of music that made Gram and had more charge than cheap dog food. There was no knowledge of Gram or the colorful people of that time. The featured characters are unfamiliar to me, even as a Gram fan and all the versions of his "after-life adventures" I've heard. Rock and Roll is full of tales, good too, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. They can be big stories even if exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and turned into guts. Stealing a corpse and the ensuing implications should never be a bland tale, but they have made it dull, one way or another. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, to go to the desert and burn them all.
