This film is horrible. Bad acting, bad writing, bad music. It's just horrible. Not only is the role play incredibly wrong, but the key elements of the movie are poorly executed. May the God in whom I do not believe I have pity on the soul of the unfortunate who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
