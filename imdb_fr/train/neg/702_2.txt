Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this slasher asleep and the light goes out quickly. If it's not her, what other reason to look at it. five students are registered to prepare a former dormitory on the scheduled date of its demolition. There are automatically problems when a strange homeless person asks and the group has few people. Then a killer is on the run. Honestly, I wanted to say that I was going to appreciate this one. There was a good installation, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The film is too slow and almost as silent as a library. Most actors are below average, and "point of view" moments are so old. The acclaimed composer Christopher Young of films like "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" wrote this, in a repetitive queue that was best made for a TV movie. Still, it seems higher than what the film deserves. So, aside from Young and Zuniga, he scrapes the bottom of the barrel.
