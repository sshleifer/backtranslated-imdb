I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I have ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and other sequels like The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they try to catch up by filling it with jokes. I do not say that jokes are bad, but they are the essence of the film. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given a 1/10. But now that I think about it, most kids do not care about the quality of the original movie, they just care that the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's horrible. Now, I think it deserves a 3/10.
