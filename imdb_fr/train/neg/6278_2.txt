You have to wonder how some cops were created ... this one decided not to use the why among so many other things and to wander beyond the theoretical debate. <br /> <br /> And yet, you have a number of honest actors who do their best to breathe some life into the story. The blue hue throughout the film overflows on "again", which in itself would be depressing, but here it is exaggerated. The idea that it is not a pathological state, nor a house, a gypsy or a curse, but simply something that, for no apparent reason, begins to arrive at our protagonist then to everyone around her. of an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have super powers but others do not know or do not know they do it? It seems they are as helpless as we are. <br /> <br /> It's a scam for a poor man who has been a victim of the "snatcher-body invasion" with Keifer Sutherland's "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense". you seriously botch these three together.
