A dog found in a local kennel is mated to Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family that has just lost their previous dog as a result of a hit and run. The puppy does not want to have time to do like Donald Trump and dismiss the Mexican governess, what a party. Only the father suspects that this dog is more than it appears, the rest of the family adores the demonic dog. So it's up to dad to say the day. <br /> <br /> This TV horror film of the late 70s is unlikely to be a good thing, except for a sense of nostalgia. When I saw this as a child, I thought it was a little tense, but revisiting it as an adult, I realize now that it's just lame, boring and not really well played. my note: D
