Why when a star reaches the top of the chain of stars, she spoils all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds reached its peak, then began making horrendous films against Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become Hollywood's most fashionable property, only to deride the terrible hero of Last Action. And here, the loquacious Eddie Murphy clears the memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with the adventure film "family", which is a missed incredibly tedious, childish and rather simple in which lucky to see big boobs Charlotte Lewis in the most attractive aspect of the whole film. <br /> <br /> History is pure tradition. This is the social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and informed that he is the Chosen One. Choose for what, I hear you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who wants to rule the world. As the main demon chic actor Charles Dance seems terribly embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for having sacrificed his talents. Of all Murphy's movies, it's easily the worst. I read reviews that suggest it's nice to see Murphy in an unusual role, in a kind of non-formic movie, and while the two points are approximately true, it is undeniable that the film - also atypical non-formally it could be - is an absolute load of waste. <br /> <br />
