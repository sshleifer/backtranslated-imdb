The standard "paint by numbers" monster fare, filled with a set of routine plot devices drawn from big-creature movies. It's as if someone had a deck of cards with plot ideas drawn from other movies, which were mixed and distributed. Whatever lines of the plot and characters appear in the contract, they were then integrated into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so clich√©s that you can play a game of "guess who ends up becoming a monster meal" after less than ten minutes in the movie, and probably get each one right, - there understood the order they will be devoured. Many characters are so odious that you have to ask the creature to silence them. Key characters include: a Billy Idol clone surfing with sharks, a bigmouth kid with billboards, a Captain Ahab man with a vendetta, and Ahab's girlfriend dancing in a bar. Oh, and a big fat beast who needs an anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> On the way, people quarrel a lot, pretty girls run everywhere with wet t-shirts, couples get along on exotic beaches, explosions occur, the ruins of a sanctuary appear and fat-faced pirates come forward. <br /> <br /> Fun, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the hardness of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent death, they make one-way jokes. I could almost hear the kicks. <br /> <br /> All in all, OK, if you have 90 minutes to spare and want to laugh at a bad movie. If not, you may want to ignore this one.
