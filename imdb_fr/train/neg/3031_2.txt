Tony Scott destroys everything that could be interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©, fragmented and overworked scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who gave up and became a bounty hunter. It's his story ... "somehow". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not really a story, and the extreme graphic stylization of each plan by Scott acts as a distancing mechanism. it makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays her like an odious and cynical kid who did nothing to deserve our respect. She hits people she does not like and rejects her clothes and inhibitions when the situation requires it, but she is not at all real and Knightly is not at all convincing either. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. It is also noisy and chained with one of the most annoying sheet music I've heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes are a bad revival of Scott's "True Romance" climax, as the Domino gang is about to meet two crazy guys who - surprise! surprise! - destined to fight at the top of a casino in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious and pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. . This is not an artistically courageous or experimental piece; It's a failure on every level, because it gives us no entry point into the life and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks great as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears in the background as "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, still solid, is underused. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the multi-layered and gimmick surface of this film. It's always a shit, no matter how hard you polish it.
