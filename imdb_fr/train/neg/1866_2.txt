A cheap movie about a mother looking for her daughter who was kidnapped by people making porn movies. The trail guides the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we, the public, struggle to stay asleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of countless sleaze soft-core movies designed for those who want the excitement of porn without the stigma or danger of seeing it appear on their credit card bill . Personally, I would prefer to have stigma since these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. It's supposed to be a sexy thriller but it's not. Most of the time, people talk about things followed by many steps from one place to another and lead to the foreground. Periodically, throughout the film, various people undress and everything has more than a touch of S & M in the debates. The material of violence and fetishism is likely to cause laughter rather than horror or even excitement, it's incredibly wrong. Even worse, there is not even enough nudity to stay interesting. <br /> <br /> You will forgive my lack of detail, but it's just a dull and boring film in which I stayed until the end hoping that something far off is coming, but he There was nothing. The most interesting thing was the naughty blonde haired with a huge bite and a nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with a morbid fascination wondering what she looked like as a girl and wondering if she had undergone plastic surgery, and not the kind of things one should think about in a captivating thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
