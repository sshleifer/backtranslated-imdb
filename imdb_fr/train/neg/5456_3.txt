It's just one of those ugly films you find on Lifetime TV, which portray the obnoxious behavior of a disgusting woman with empathy. With other nasty movies like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man and Vili, a 12-year-old girl, would you have made a compassionate and empathic picture with this person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine changing the genre in this movie, and you'll see why myself and others here consider it a worthless trash. If the sexes were reversed, there would be no attempt at empathy with the criminal. Instead, we would probably be treated with a portrait of a monstrous and hideous man attacking a girl, her lascivious behavior putting him in prison, and his victim with brainwashing suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this movie is because of his sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call a cat a cat. The Toureau is a pedophile. Clear and simple. No if, of and, or of but. She is a criminal who belongs to the prison and deserves our derision and scorn, but certainly not our pity or our empathy.
