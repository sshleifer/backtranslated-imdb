I am an A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this film in class, and what I drew is the blatant bias involved in the film. The film is obviously directed towards P.O.V. of "common deafness" is not common ground. In addition, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also under discussion in this topic. THAT IS TO SAY. Deaf People born hearing and deafened thereafter. Is it true or false in this case? The film is biased and virtually everything to the deaf's opinion with a capital "D". It's not bad, but for it to be a real documentary, you have to try to be slightly impartial.
