Like last year, I did not manage to get through it. Ok, Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather, on the total troubles accumulated in the theater, he was not in the top 10 most boring. Many presenters, however, were part of this coveted Top 10. I did not know everything was going well (although I knew it was written in a script), but it was really terrible to see that so-called good actors unable to insert an expression, turn away look and stumble on simple words (Natalie Portman, if there is no director, she left). Night Dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles selected good songs and there were very few decent speeches and decent clips. Adam Sandler wins the worst presenter award. <br /> <br /> For having helped me write this review, I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my pedicurist for believing in me, and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I have not starved myself for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
