This film is so, so, so horrible that it makes the angels lose wings. Shaq had been trying to make other efforts, such as his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic portion of the horrendous movie Steel. <br /> <br /> There is not one good thing to say about this movie. I saw it many times when I was very young, but I had to be an idiot then, because this movie takes all that is nice about movies and tears it. It's fun to make fun of. I saw it on Disney Channel some time ago and spent a few minutes doing it. Even so, once the thrill of making fun of him is done, you are still overwhelmed by his terror. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, try this: think, while watching the movie, to remove all the scenes in which Shaq uses his powers of magic genius. If you do that, it becomes a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and hitting to seduce him. It's quite funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A horrible example of a movie. Do not watch this movie unless you try to make fun of it.
