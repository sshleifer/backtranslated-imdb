Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's, the commercial center of this movie <br /> <br /> is home to an explosives magazine. This is the only place where the main character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he plants in the mall in the boring end. <br /> <br /> A fictional city has a new shopping center, built on land it was <br /> <br /> condemned. Pretty girl (I did not understand her name) found a job <br /> <br /> waitress. She lost her boyfriend in a fire on the site where the shopping center <br /> <br /> is located. The nasty owner of the mall hires the fire arsonist <br /> <br /> as a security guard after the death of her first security guard. Rob Estes, well before "Silk Stalkings", is a <br /> <br /> photographer / reporter looking for a story. He met Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their "funny" friend, Pauly Shore, and tried to find out if Eric <br /> <br /> was still alive. He lives in the basement of the mall (?) And <br /> walks through the air ducts and diffuse different people <br /> <br /> who upset his former girlfriend, including arson . Finally, he kidnaps her <br /> <br /> and the final includes the bomb and all those who flee the scene in front of the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is in the party <br /> <br /> as mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably did not need a plot sketch since <br /> <br /> story is in the title. Someone named Eric is taking revenge on <br /> <br /> people as a mall ghost. It also means that there is no suspense <br /> <br />. We know that Eric is behind all this, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> Estes and Cute Girl follow the course of a silly investigation. <br /> <br /> Look like Fairchild, which we know has been angry with the owner of the mall <br /> <br /> from the beginning, take out a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of <br /> <br /> festive evening, but no one says a word as she heads to her office <br /> <br /> and to her eventual death. The fictional city is huge, but a police officer is never called, everyone relies on the security of the mall. <br /> <br /> Eric is hiding since the construction of the mall, but I'm not sure where <br /> <br />. He seems to live in a basement, but one would think that a construction worker would have found him. He also <br /> <br /> furnished his love tablet quite well and found some outlets because he has <br /> <br /> electricity. It may be better than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Take note, both of you. He tip a security guard <br /> <br /> out of his cabin taking the picture to black. Yes, stop sweeping <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, this is where you'll be able to see a black and white granular plan <br /> <br /> from the south shore of Pauly, but without no weezil. <BR/> <br /> It's just a junk and proof that I'm ready to rent <br /> <br /> about anything in the video store to stay in the horror section. This film <br /> <br /> is not Eric's revenge, it's the filmmaker's revenge for me <br /> <br /> to be stupid enough to look at him. Here is my revenge: I do not recommend it. It'll show them! <br /> <br /> This is noted (R) for physical violence, some gun violence, gore, <br /> <br /> some profanity, some female nudity, short male nudity and some sexual content < br /> <br />.
