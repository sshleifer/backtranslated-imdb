Honestly, before watching this film, I had heard many people say that this film was a shame. I did not believe that Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey had played roles in this film and had watched it for myself. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect much from Justin because it does not really belong to the cinema / theater. business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not help but wonder why on earth they had agreed to participate in Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> One would think that if the players are void, then I should pay more attention to the story. This is indeed the story is the core of a movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to give credit for its story. Imagine this: a smart journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote an article against the system while learning to become a "real" reporter for his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by an agent who is always keen to claim justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a story that ends well. <br /> <br /> Good God, I could not even continue with that. Just remember that the movie is already making me sick. My advice guys, do not look at that! Please save your money and time for another movie.
