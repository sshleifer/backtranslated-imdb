I do not know what to say about this horrible movie that has not been said yet. Honestly, I have only myself to make myself angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this film that it would be a horrible shit, but I loved War Games, so I let myself go at my whim. I will live to regret this decision the rest of my life. From the beginning, when government officials explained that their supercomputer could determine who was a terrorist based on the quality of their video game, I knew I was going for a ride without forgetting the name of the country. The list of very, very, very bad lines of the plot, dialogues and actions is so long that I would plant IMDb if I tried to publish it. To those who said they have seen worse movies than this one, tell me. In fact, I'm curious to see something that could go beyond this pile of steaming horse poop.
