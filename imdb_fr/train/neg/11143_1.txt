Hi, I'm a friend of the werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves, I thought "hmm, simple and friendly name at least ... Althou ... I wonder why I have not heard before. "<br /> <br /> First, the film starts with breasts. Many tits. Breasts are pretty much all that movie budget went to. Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses to get pictures of topless! biker Not even very sturdy, but as the old sage says in the movie "he's a lot more powerful and dangerous than ever." Just by describing her as a tattooed biker type. Pretty original. I even watched twice when they used for the first time the special effect "bright red eyes"! I mean, my god, this effect "let's put-the-red-points-on-eyes-with-computer" has been used since the seventies. It looks very ugly here! And do not get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI. As said before, as a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, as I do like wolf movies, as I said. They almost always build a werewolf legend. Darkwolf is also building the werewolf world about silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the old bloodline. BUT. It's almost instantly after creating the engagement rules that "the black wolf kills all the people the girl has touched" begins to slice randomly. What makes no sense, why even bother to tell us the rules of the murder, when they will not even follow them ... In addition, the plans from the point of view of the wolf are made with a handycam of Sony or something. , mainly filming the floor and the walls. Just add some grunting noises and you get a great werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf hits everyone with an open hand, just by laying hands on the victims, that's not enough for me ... <br /> <br /> The truth is that WHO is giving money to Make these piles of junk are directly horrible, they are not even funny bad movies, but simply sad.
