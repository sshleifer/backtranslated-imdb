A nonconformist policeman with family problems and who likes to use his firearm ?? Check! Isolated place with a valuable object that needs to be stolen ?? Check! Interesting love looking ?? Check! Assortment of criminal gangsters stuffed with cardboard and gloomy European accents ?? Check! Bad German guy played by an English actor with a piece of nerdy dialogue for all occasions ?? Check! Corny one liners ?? Check! <br /> <br /> My dear friend, is this film really small or what? Clich√©s go fast and well like an avalanche and most actors are speechless in front of the scenario. <br /> <br /> In a cheap and cheerful movie, Die Hard's video scam only Located on a mountain (with a few pique lines of the above), we have all the usual activation shots, Gradually selected as good old violence and nudity are launched to wake up all the spectators who have just acquiesced. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the cop in its entirety in John McClane's mode, which even manages the time of your nasty old man with gun has used all his gags of balls at one time. <br /> In the midst of this mess, there are some well-known recognizable faces that, I can only assume, needed the money and / or were just playing it for laughs right from the start. useless beginning scene that had nothing to do with the plot until the final conclusion implausible complete with the ropey dialogue and even copy effec cts. <br /> <br /> Looking up at these three books from the supermarket sales effort on IMDb, I'm surprised to see that this failure has spawned not one but two sequels, I have to find these gems on DVD! Looks like the first sequel is a scam of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, well God knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each movie and even the name of the character seems to change for the third part. <br /> <br /> However, blind purchases of cheap DVDs would simply not be the same if the studios did not continue to trot material of this horrible quality !!
