The subject seems pretty dated today. Adapted for television from Rona Jaffe's book; we stumble and stumble in a fantastic existence. Four students play a live version of the Mazes and Dragons board game (based on Dungeons and Dragons). A young player, a young Tom Hanks, goes too deep into the fantasy world. His teammates must come to his rescue and save him from the harm done by himself. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the match quartet. The lead actors are Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> At this date, the group seems heavy and tame. But the highlight of the observation is to see Tom Hanks between his salad days "Bosom Buddies" and his big hit in SPLASH on the big screen. The youngest viewer will get the most pleasure.
