I saw this movie without knowing anything in advance. The plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. The film did not have the feeling of "battle of wits". The actors just vomited a mouthful of nonsense, sometimes forcing me to cringe pain while they were buzzing. The plot was predictable, with the exception of the erotic homo erotic erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic, but makes me physically sick to the stomach), even the end was predictable. And you could tell the detective that Jude Law was disguised as a costume, whether it was a false accent, horrible dental work, the facial hair of a costume shop, everything indicated that it was a disguise . The whole movie was like a waste of time in my life. This film had the atmosphere of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as a window to see the show, very disappointing in my opinion.
