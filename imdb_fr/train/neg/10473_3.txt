I went to see the Omega code with a group of other Christians totaling about fifteen people. We all expected a good Christian movie. What we had was an extremely painful, long and boring movie attempt. It has good production values ​​but also has a bad acting, a weak scenario with a lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes, we all knew that the night would be long. We all hated this, and some people in our group put this film as an odor of more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Bright effects and sharp cinematography can not save this bad movie. I would give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only high because I rented the abominable "film" Werewolf (1996) the night before seeing this movie.
