I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I'll go in any movie to see her, which led me to Purple Butterfly. Although I wanted to love this film, I agree with many others who commented on it. It is very confusing and extremely slow. Since the whole movie seems to have been shot with a portable camera, important parts of it are blurry. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and what is not telling you much. There are countless scenes of people standing, smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room, looking at each other without talking to each other. The time lag of the film is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even after reading several reviews in advance and having a general idea of ​​what the film was, I still struggled to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the movie was not very similar to Ziyi Zhang's previous films, but I was anxious to see it in a different way, but unfortunately I was disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, although she admits most of the time that she does not have a smile. I could have done without sex scenes because they were as sexual as possible and without any obvious feelings between the participants, as you might expect.
