This is the worst shit imaginable. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very amusing and dramatic. The authors of this worthless film do not follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred and make free versions for me if you have your own ideas. If all we can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and diluted pictures, we must stick to the original. Had they done so, this film would have been at least twice as good, even with less performing actors and if it had been shot inside a studio with cardboard huts. But there is no imagination at all, just fatigue. This should only be purchased or viewed by collectors of Victorian novels turned into movies. <br /> <br /> Just a hint, not a spoiler, I think, to get those who read the novel to understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch this on television or - God forbid - waste money by buying this. Gagool, a nasty old witch in the book and a precursor of Gollum, has been turned into a nice girl!
