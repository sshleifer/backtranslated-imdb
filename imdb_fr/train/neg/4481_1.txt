I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque's commercials, but I thought I could give him a chance. So, I looked at it, and all I can say is that it bleeds. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate a movie as much. Watching this movie, I remembered those fun scenes in Altman's "The Player" when the writers presented their bizarre ideas to the producers. I'd like to know which MTV producer has decided on an adaptation of a 1.5 hour video of Bronte (but this time, Heathcliff's name is Heath and he's a rock star, and Hindley's name is Hendrix) would be a good idea. <BR/> <br /> Even though it might not be so bad, they would not have had all the other aspects of the movie so horribly wrong. The direction was to be "you're alone, pout for me". I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and was bored for everything else. The camera work was irregular and reminded me many times that I was watching a bad movie trying to be pissed off. My theory is that the soundman got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom - all I could hear in half of the scenes was the waves. And in the other scenes, I'd like everything I can hear. And speaking of her, what they did to the song "More" from Sisters of Mercy is absolutely inexcusable, but again, it's inexcusable what they did in Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was an entertaining scene - especially when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you can tell me what this scene has to do with the rest of the story more power for you.
