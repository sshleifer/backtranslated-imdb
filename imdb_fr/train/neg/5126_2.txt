I rented this movie because I hoped all family members would benefit. Although the film is family-friendly, my family did not like the film because it gives a false vision of God. If you obey God and follow him, success is not guaranteed. Your football team will not always win. Like magic, you will not have better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get an increase. Sometimes you will be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to answer all our whims. We were instead created to glorify him. Sometimes we glorify him the most when things seem to go wrong for us. To live is Christ; to die is a gain.
