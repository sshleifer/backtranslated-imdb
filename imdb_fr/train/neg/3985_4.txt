Plain and ordinary thriller about an accomplice woman who cheats everyone she loves supposedly to grow his bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceiver Tracey, married to Andy (Bill Pullman). Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), an old friend of Andy, appears as a resident surgeon. The problems are not far behind him. <br /> <br /> The script fails because it does not carefully develop the promising principles into an effective and enticing thriller, and the cruel lack of motivation of character, background and development leave all the scope a spectacle. None of the actors can arouse interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose Andy is inexplicably curious and impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Poor filmmaker Harold Becker is left to try to resurrect an incredibly dead project, and is unable to make entertainment out of it all. At the moment the "secret" of the plot is revealed, you will not worry anymore. <br /> <br /> At least, cinematography gives Massachusetts a beautiful appearance. The stars are also George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
