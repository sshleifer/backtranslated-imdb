I caught him on a test. All I can say is: What is ... hell? This film goes as well as Mickey Mouse reads the script of "Scarface". It's weird beyond making any sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still as weird as it is not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile that contains a CIA probe. The CIA comes looking for his investigation after Irwin. Irwin takes them for poachers and begins to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> That's about all history that exists; the rest are ballads of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin rides a motorhome at high speed and fights with a CIA agent over it. Yes, it's true: Steve Irwin's knife is fighting a guy at the top of a camper. Be your guide for this ridiculously bad movie.
