I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie and who likes to watch movies on the paranormal. The film was shot entirely in video, so it looks like a PBS special. The special effects are whimsical, but there are actually scary moments in the film that made us sit in our shoes. There is a particularly effective alert involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the scenes of "the plot" are long and very boring, and I will tell you that I do not know what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
