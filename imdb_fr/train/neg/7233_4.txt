I feel a bit like a genius; I feel that I am the only one to have gone through this fake film. I watched it three times, once with comments, and found myself upset in front of all close-ups, every time the screen is all black, and worse, I feel that the movie never really solves nothing. Yes, the priest dies, but he did not really seem at peace with the city that caused him so much grief, or with himself. And he was an idiot. Without Peter Cowie's commentary that explains not only the film but also the book from which it came, I could not have supported it at all. I appreciate French films, but this one was completely absurd. <br /> <br /> The diary of a country priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but can not alone save this deadly and dull tripe. Scene after scene, extreme close-ups where the characters say nothing until the camera cuts off and goes black do NOT make an interesting or relevant story. It's amazing how this film has become a classic: it reminds me more of the emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance of Claude Laydu is sincere and provocative, if you are a sadist, but this film I feel empty because, overall, it is a slight impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and unglamorous institution of corruption. The young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a faint scene, but 90% of the film will draw you into his dismal introspection and his window to the young priest's melancholy thoughts. This priest does not seem to be as humble as he is pitiable, he is simply pitiful. <br /> <br /> Since I do not speak or understand French, I was eager to do the English thing SUBTITLE to help understand. the film. The English subtitle is sometimes impossible to see / read and the text scrolls so quickly that there were a lot of things I could not read (and I'm not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie. I try everything that is "chosen" by the Criterion collection, but I do not see why, in many ways, it deserves a kind of critical nod. However, I spent this entire two-hour film aspiring to feel some kind of empathy for the main character, and that never materialized. He just seemed to be a victim rather than a fighter. And for that, I say it stinky.
