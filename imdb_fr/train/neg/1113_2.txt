Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and is not called Topper? Go understand! <br /> <br /> This parody is a blatant injustice to the greatest cowboy hero, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays it is young against old, blond hair against white hair and kills people against shooting at them. Will the real Hopalong want to get up? <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever made, believe it or not, by the person who gave us the Grandfather saga!
