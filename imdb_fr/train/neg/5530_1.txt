Among the many problems of this film, the worst is continuity; and reissuing it on VHS for a university cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what was wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer movie and then cut it for standard theatrical viewing. How much time left? To fill all the holes of the plot, we would need three more hours of narrative and character development, especially considering that the film we have is so slow and takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's amazing; What could Halperin have been trying to accomplish here? Their previous movie, "White Zombie", was a successful attempt to reproduce the first Universal Studios monster movies (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and thus remained quite close to the zombie mythology that North America would know popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The revolt of the zombies, on the contrary, seems to have been conceived as an allegory of the politics of modern warfare. That would explain not only the opening and the change of the character of Dean Jagger megalomaniac, but also the reason why the zombies do not play much in the film. In addition to standing up, scary and waiting for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not cannibals of the undead that we all loved and hate in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I'm equal to all those who do not like modern war and its politics - the film should be entertaining first, and only later perhaps, educational. And certainly - a movie about zombies should be dedicated to zombies. <br /> <br /> Really one of the most bizarre movies in Hollywood history, but I can not recommend it, even for its historical value.
