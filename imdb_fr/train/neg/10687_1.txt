End of the game has started well, the less we say about the end, the better. it seemed like things were just going to keep the plot going, for example the journalist who at first is a very curious and intelligent person, half way does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are not given any reason for that other than that, the next scene would not make sense without it. The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, which would have given an average political drama on television. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is however very watchable and James Woods does an admirable job considering its end. <br /> <br /> The end Honestly, the game was one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... and that's saying something, I saw Gigli.
