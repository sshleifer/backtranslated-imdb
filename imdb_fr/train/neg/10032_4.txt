The scenario agreed. Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There were so many hues and tears above her zero size but she did not look skinny. I do not know why Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There was nothing to do for him in the movie. It is not because it is a Yashraj film that the actor must accept the role, whatever its quality. Ali Khan agreed. I think it's high time for Indian filmmakers and producers to start looking at Indian customers as a smart lot. What are we? fools !!!! What do they think, they will show two men who are part of a SWAT team and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that it tries to attack criminals ... it takes a whole squad of more than 100 policemen and no one was around to surround the palace. The action was shit and I have never seen such bad action. Akshay Kumar was part of a circle of 30 to 40 policemen who were all shooting at him ... and he was returning the favor. No police bullet touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Shit. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the director of the fight who thought of this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to see this movie.
