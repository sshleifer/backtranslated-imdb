Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a courier for the troubled television channel UBC (United Broadcasting Corporation); he's not going anywhere to work and is proposing ridiculous projects like "The Doctor Dog of Abraham Lincoln" to studio directors because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. The director of programming, Joe Flynn (Francis X. Wilbanks), wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to choose a successful TV show. Her secretary Heather North (under the name of Jennifer Scott), who doubles as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who is hurting Captain Russell to death when he wants to watch television. It turns out that the monkey looks at all the popular shows and can easily pick the hits. Russell discovers the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to advance his own career. Naturally, things go wrong for Russell and the actors! <br /> <br /> The distillery the chimpanzee (handled by Frank Lamping) works well; Raffles looks bored and / or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimpanzee is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with revisions or editions. A slight satirical touch is present - imagine a monkey taking successful television series! AND it's a monkey who gets a beer during commercials (drink in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a group of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place. You can make a drinking game, in honor of Raffles' refined beer, by guessing the actors and locating them beforehand. Here's a start - Hey, is not it "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? At the bottom of the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn and John Ritter
