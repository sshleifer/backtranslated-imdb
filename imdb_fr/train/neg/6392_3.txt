Gordon Herschell fans Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they choose this movie for his usual blood pails, as there is very little precious information about bleeding in this movie. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell this bizarre story by relying on exceptional special effects on a budget that could probably have been doubled if the cast had run out of pocket one day. Curiously, although cheap and very badly played (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total parody of the plot holds the attention. Imagine what this movie could have been with a decent budget! Overall, this matches the tastes of champagne on a beer budget.
