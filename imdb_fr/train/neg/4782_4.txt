1 watched 24/12/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas stories that are not detailed enough to explain the true story of this factual incident involving a man who was wrongfully put in prison to get a job for his family to make Christmas for them. The family's three children then fled to Washington, DC, to recruit US President Herbert Hoover. This trek provides secondary stories such as their positive encounters with a tramp and a puppeteer, which gives the movie an air of Disney's "animal on the go" movie that is not appropriate here. In the end, there is no detail on how the president helped the family and that's another negative point of the film, in my opinion. The film ends up crying, but it takes too much time to get there. The film is not supposed to be an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it shows the obvious fades that make it look like that ?? so I'm not sure that their information is accurate. All in all, it's a simple film (which could have been more complex) with a good Christmas story, but played in a bland way and without much substance.
