Yes, it's one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so banal, that you will not be able to stop laughing anymore. I watched comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other reviews give the idea quite well. The characters are so unpleasant that you applaud the rats, the effects are so badly done that you wonder what art class of primary school was in charge, the acting, oh the actor , talking about tired dialogs and embarrassing breaks. <br /> But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we did not see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often, the "big problem" does not appear before the end, because the budget is limited and good effects spend so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case, the big rat was concealed until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed of what they had best to have a guy who was dressed like a groundhog with a third dentistry -world. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After realizing that the rats could not stand a loud noise (migraines caused by bad behavior?), The main guy set off a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. If you have always wanted to see a pair of rats waltz while blood was coming out of their head like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, all right?
