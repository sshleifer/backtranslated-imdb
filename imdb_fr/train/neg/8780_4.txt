Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes widowed on the death of his wife. Shortly after, he is approached by a Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims to receive messages from his wife Anna, deceased, via various electronic gadgets. Does Anna try to say something to Jonathan? Is it just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or extraterrestrial scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story in which he's stuck is complex and absurd at times; it is as if the film did not know how to answer the questions it raised, so it distracted the viewer by new unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is pretty good, and convinces convincingly. distraught widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He matured a lot as an actor, leaving behind the friendly waacky-hijinks roles to the siblings he had played about fifteen years ago. It looks a little steep, with maybe a little more wrinkling than you'd expect, but it has not lost any of the cunning and panache that it showed during its quarter of century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's not that Keaton is performing in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more and more confused as it unfolds, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. That's fine if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement, something that connects more or less everything and explains ... something. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I had ever seen before. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to look at this junk, although he is very well supported by Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a love interest.
