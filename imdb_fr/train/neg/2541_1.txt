I've never seen the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a much better movie than this one or that the rest of the 1980s had been like it was not that way. two terrible consequences have been justified. This film had a very good lead when it announced that it would be broadcast on one of those old independent stations that belong to the past. Anyway, it seemed like it would be a very good horror movie. However, it was a film that would make some Walt Disney films look dark. Really, this movie was just a heap of light fluff with virtually no dribbling stream creature to see. The only real observation is close to the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, apart from the fact that there is virtually no sign of the creature that was really disappointing in its infancy. The story basically says that the old evil hunters have to kill everything they see and are interested in the damaged creature of the brook and the children to help him or just a hairy guy at random in the woods who loves shoot boats at random in the water. Not really worth looking at, but I'd love to see the original, knowing that the creator of this movie would be an equally damaged creature of the 80s, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70s, "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
