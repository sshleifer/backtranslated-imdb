Many people thought it was a good movie but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spaceship crashed on the ground and some of the extraterrestrials escaped from the spaceship, then they killed people on the ground, but for no reason. In addition, it is in a dark forest, I see nothing on the screen, I can hardly hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the predator has arrived on earth but no one has yet sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on earth, so he there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the director of the extraterrestrials and killed him for no reason. He was not alive on earth, it does not concern him. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and it is not possible to tell the story to the commentators. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think it's a good movie.
