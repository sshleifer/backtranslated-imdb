When you go to the open air cinema under the Greek summer night, you do not care what the film is! Edison started really well with the good efforts of the singers who want to be actors and Morgan Freeman again but ... (In a movie, there is usually a good start to capture the audience, does, a little boring however, at middle of the film, more characters and less action, it's done, and the third part is really a good thing so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (drunk 'weapons can demolish a building) shoot a guy behind a car, do not hit him even once while he kills all (except 3) and then the guy comes out a flamethrower (to kill the rest 3) you you realize that the Greek summer The sky filled with stars is too good to be distracted by a film like this!
