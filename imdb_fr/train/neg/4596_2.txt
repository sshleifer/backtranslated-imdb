A question for you: a family goes to a new home and is harassed by demonic forces. Which movie do I talk about? Every horror movie you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I will say that there are many scenes of teenage anxiety. Do not help? Well, there are a lot of bits where characters are harassed by a creature and you see the characters through the creature's POV. No more forward? Ok, there is a sequence of dreams with a lot of blood? Could always be a horror movie you say. Oh well it could take weeks so I would say the film I'm talking about is about a lot of Australians, many of whom appeared in NEIGHBORS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, it's true that the movie is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the exercise above is? It's about me to show that THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that was shot
