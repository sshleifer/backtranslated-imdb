I watched this film based on the very positive reviews I had read about it here. <br /> <br /> They certainly saw something in this movie that I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, then it starts to be recorded and dragging, not to mention the incredible. <br /> <br /> You end up finding yourself saying, "What?!? He's going to do that too? How far will he go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, entering a deli to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. It sounds a bit strong, but wait, there is more. <br /> <br /> John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that make no logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful loving girlfriend, a safe and well paid job, a beautiful house, a beautiful car, Costly costumes - decides to get loser, like Auggie Rose, and to experience life in low-paying work, to live in a dump with a silly girlfriend and possible relationships with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why this weak half-cooked and spiritual movie has got favorable reviews that I'll never know. Admittedly, Goldblum does a good job of acting - he always does - and his appearance has improved with age - but unless you have a big passion for Jeff Goldblum and you have to see all the movies in which he is, I would not recommend this turkey. That's about two hours of your life that you will not come back - and believe me - you will have no reason to thank you once these two hours are over, apart from thanking you for not sitting around watching this movie ! <br /> <br />
