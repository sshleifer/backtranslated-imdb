Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his movie stories. A mother and her son settle in a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are somnambulists, feline creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; no more hints of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is remarkable as a mother. Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett are also present. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the guardian of the cemetery.
