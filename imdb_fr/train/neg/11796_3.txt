Is there nothing else on television? Are you really bored? So look at Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and do not buy it. It would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched this on TV and laughed at times. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you're looking for an extremely funny "funny" movie, watch it on Friday. If you're looking for a powerful emotional movie (something this movie is trying to do ... like that), look at something like hoops or Jason's Lyric. If you are looking for a good "booty" black, go watch a porn film Dominique Simone, because the nudity in this film is almost nonexistent. However, if you have nothing better to do and it's on the cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be slightly amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
