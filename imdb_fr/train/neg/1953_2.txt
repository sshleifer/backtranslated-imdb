The first episode of this new show took place today and it was horrible. Not only does Shaggy have a new voice that squeaks from his lines, but he's so far removed from the original concept and animation style that he's barely recognizable as a "Scooby-Doo" series . <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew, Scrappy, was there, the team has always solved mysteries. In this new show, Shaggy and Scooby fight a super villain of James Bond and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser of the next episode that promised a transformers-type robotic car did NOT make me comfortable). How can we take Scooby Doo and do that? <br /> <br /> The show pays two points for two scenes featuring the whole gang of Scooby Doo, all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy, and even then, I am far too generous.
