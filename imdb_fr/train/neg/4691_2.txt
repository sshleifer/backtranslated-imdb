A real explosion of the film literally. This British film is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How could the authors and producers of this stinker make such a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as a specialist called to defuse the bomb, has a terrible writing material. Naturally, when he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would be enough to end his career. <br /> <br /> This old man who loves trains and interferences is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was very insulting to show this man, even at the end.
