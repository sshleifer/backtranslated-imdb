Omen IV (1991) was a bad product for T.V. film. Since the 1980s were over, I guess executives were experimenting with methamphetamine (the drug of choice in the '90s) because there was no other reason for this parody. Why did they even bother to do that? A movie t.v. What did they think when he appeared on the board of ideas? Did they even think for a second that this film was going to make its way? Maybe they thought it might be a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have broken a few dollars instead of releasing this "extra" record. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically a remake of the American family of the first film. Instead of a punk kid with a brittle nose, we get the scary girl who is a total kid to everyone around her. If the family had better parenting skills, none of the demonic events that occurred in previous movies would ever have happened. These parents must be disciplined and disciplined! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, avoid at all costs!
