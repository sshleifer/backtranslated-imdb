For national audiences, I can see how they would applaud this movie. For foreigners, having no vested interest, it did not make much sense. The Germans have been described as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and distracting. How could a young woman "love" the lieutenant who had just caught sight of him was nonsense? As she could, as mentioned at the end of the film, never get married just because of this craze, it was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, as evidenced by the swamp hunt. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and stayed there listening. I guess they did not want to wet their boots, but I'm sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men to search the marsh in the water. But that would have ended the story. In addition, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the attic and did not bother to fire on the roof. At worst, a soldier would have thrown a grenade into the attic and would not have climbed into a ladder to look into it. I saw critics who said they cried in the end. I wonder why? You knew that this little group would perish and that nothing had to hold it back.
