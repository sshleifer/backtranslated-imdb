It's one of the most dreadful movies of all time. Shaq would do better to stick to basketball. This film took part in my life, I will never see it again. I'm going to make fun of this movie until I die, and more. It's so horrible that it's not even funny. MST3000 would have a crazy pleasure with this one.
