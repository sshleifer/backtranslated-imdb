if they gave me the option of negative numbers, I would use it. This movie was really horrible. I went to the theaters hoping that it was horrible and that it would have exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br /> The scenario was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to go out, but my friend drove and wanted to get value for money. I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when the girls had their super power and the hair change the color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed to be wrong on the part of the super villain, he was strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) was psychotic and strange, as was Matt's friend (Luke Wilson), Vaughn (Rainn Wilson).
