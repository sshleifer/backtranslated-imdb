Certainly the worst movie I have ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where should I have laughed? There is not a hint or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are pestilential, especially that (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily that can not create a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the dreamlike insertion of Dracula ... another way, taken from the worst tradition of cabaret, to make this "film" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too hard to save. I would have given "0" / 10, but the lowest note was 1/10 so I had to overestimate it by one point.
