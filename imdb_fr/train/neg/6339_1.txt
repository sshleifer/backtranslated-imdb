All of David Prior's films are terrible in every way: bad writing, bad pictures, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually referred to as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their involuntary hilarity. The plot of almost all of David Prior's "movies" (as I like to call them) is basically the same. Male commandos, all American, team up to blow up the evil communists. But unlike other Cold War era trash such as Red Dawn, Prior's films are really fun because of their local and acting style. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was the other guy?) Is summoned by General Mitchell for a very secret mission in South America. The funniest line of the film is then delivered, which gives the following effect: "It's my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Did you train your roommate? And apparently, this will be their solution to avoid deportation. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems on a used video anywhere, BUY them. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to get their hands on Night Wars and Aerobicide, aka "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most is Final Sanction, with Robert Z'dar, looking monstrous.
