I watched Grendel the other night and was forced to make a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglican epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless, uninspiring films, and the premieres promised a mini-epic inauthentic, low budget, but it refused to let me change channels. It was amazing, incredibly bad. I watched with fascination and horror the sinking of the train from which you could not take your eyes off. I took a notebook and managed to capture some of what I saw. The following may contain spoilers or maybe just save your sanity. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to finish, the Beowulf warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial problem with what followed. It also seems that the helmets were in a bin and handed over to the actor who was wandering afterwards. Appearance, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed to make the Ringling Brothers circus movie, Barnum and Bailey. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already made up the rest. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as a king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become king of the Danes just minutes before the film's beginning and had not yet had the opportunity to resize the crown to suit him. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate the return of actors to their waiting table, no one was required to change their hairstyle. The variety of hair included forks, favorites, fashionable cuts and a mullet, which at least served to distract from the dialogue. To prove that the distribution was multinational, they were all encouraged to retain the chosen focus. <br /> <br /> - As it is typical in this type of film (at least since Mad Max), a leather armor was essential. . In this case, it was strange, ill-fitting and brand new. <br /> <br /> - The female love interest, Ingrid, interpreted by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of hotties to watch with the volume completely lowered. <br /> <br /> - The film was intended unwanted repetition crossbow composed with explosive locks. He never needed to be charged and even had a setback when he was fired. He managed to destroy the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical facts and the suspense all by himself. <br /> <br /> - The Hrothgar Palace, Heorot, rather than being a long Nordic Hall, was apparently designed and built by craftsmen who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived in the native country of the Danes aboard a two-mast ship on the stern that was part of a set, the other two being Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth observed the approach of Beowulf's ship using a telescope. Before you can recover from this incredible innovation, you must see the ship from her point of view. Judging by the angle, the prince was in a plane. <br /> <br /> - Anecdote 1: In Bulgaria, fire (like that of a chimney) creates light without heat. That explains why you could see the breath of the actors whether inside or outside. <br /> <br /> - amusing Anecdote 2: dancing in Denmark, the age of Dark Age looks like slow dances that I attended in the 8th. <br /> - Fun fact 3: You too can do a catapult with a long-acting explosive. But do not expect it to really hurt something. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a World War II veteran, shouting "Incoming!" to shred any suspension of disbelief that remained. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so upset and always fearful because he could not leave footprints as an entirely CGI creation. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and the junior did not inherit her wings. Recessive gene, I guess. By the way, we can now make an educated guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and his mother have chosen to kill, fly with or drag their prey on the sole basis of a close reading. of the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - A funny medical fact: to be criticized by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown at a distance of one hundred feet against a stone causes slight scratches on the face that do not bleed much. <br /> <br /> - The legendary sword used by Beowulf to ship the Hag was as large as possible and would have contained enough steel to lay a second bridge over the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the flicker dispelled any worry about his weight. <br /> <br /> - Best Replica of the Movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit out a pint of blood about six feet. Princess Ingrid rocked him gently and said, "All will be well, my prince." So much for this job at the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
