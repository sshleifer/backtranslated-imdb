I only saw the film recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining film, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... It reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who was only looking to be understood before defeating his opponents. Throughout the movie, I waited to hear at least one confession about what she loved, why did she fight, who did she love and trust her. I waited in vain. Shit movie. Shit dialogue. Do not look at her unless you want to be bored! It's so bad that I finally wondered how I managed not to scream in frustration for an hour and a half. About. I give a 4/10.
