If you read my article on SyFy's "Dinoshark," you know I can understand the low-budget schlock that these movies designed for television can provide. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still very funny in a style "so bad, it's good". So, still feeling guilty for having loved (and recommended) the "Dinoshark" undeniably hokey, I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", an original SyFy movie about a monster half-man, half-hammer, terrorizing people on an island. With the infallible SyFy recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could this go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it's really missing the target ... not a lot, but enough so I do not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, the dreaded hammer-human hybrid, gives way to a group of fake military thugs who really become the main villain of the movie. Although the hammerhead accumulates the number of bodies, it (or what you call it the thing) only arrives just before someone is about to chew and leaves immediately afterwards. The rest of the film is filled, opposing our heroes to these soldiers. For me, this is not as convincing as watching a hammerhead shark eating people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
