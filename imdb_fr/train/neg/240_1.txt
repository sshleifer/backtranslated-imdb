I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I really have to do it. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have lost it completely. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with nerdy wedding videos. Vivah is so old-fashioned that the Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in the film where I can say, "Oh, at least this thing is good." Aloknath does not cliche in the role of the girl's father, Shahid kapoor has Looking tired and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster, in addition to derogatory settings, bad costumes, a messy scenario, a monstrous mother-in-law, hard-to-play actors, cacophonous founders, cheap soundtracks. br /> <br /> Now, the spoiler, I warn you that, as in all his other films, a catastrophic impact film ends on a happy note.
