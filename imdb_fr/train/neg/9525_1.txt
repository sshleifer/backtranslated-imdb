This totally boring, insane, useless, mindless and stupid film is not the definitive proof that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his post-Trainspotting films: The Beach has already dealt with it. This low-budget quirk only secures its place among those who have started very well, but have completely lost themselves in drugs, alcohol, ego, self-delusion, mismanagement or whatever led to the rapid disappearance of this once promising director. <br /> <br /> The principle is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and a certain bimbo, Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet by chance and start singing spontaneously with a fervor that looks more like an asylum. aloes only to a potential success. duo - they become. One of their friends - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their director by smashing a shop window and stealing a video camera with which he films them in "action" and then showing the band to musicians who really interested in this movie. garbage. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has put in unbelievable pieces, but that's ridiculous; the music gives Oasis the appearance of the Beatles. During recordings in the studio, the duo - Strumpet - changes the lyrics at each take and Ecclestone arrogantly tells the music guys to take them or leave them, and quite absurdly. Music is not only total and total, but its "interpreters" are antisocial; these newcomers are supposed to be masters. It's too stupid. It's just awful. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not funny and is not going anywhere. This story of horns makes no sense and does not make sense. We often feel improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little bin is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone's I.Q. we must also ask ourselves if he has accepted to be part of this nonsense. Anyone who has financed this Â£ 1,000 joke has to leave the cinema sector before selling their own underwear on the street corners.
