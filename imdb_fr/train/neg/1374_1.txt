Dude, it was hilarious. He should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have been a lot easier to realize the pile of stench. Seriously? I want everyone involved in this film to be effective immediately. For all those who are considering watching this "movie", let's take a look at some plot points. Oh, wait. There are not any. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and he decided to shoot something at random, and miraculously, the video was recorded. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me? Go look at him. Do it, man. I dare you. But be ready to open your eyes. If you can escape without blowing up a cow, you are very strong and brave.
