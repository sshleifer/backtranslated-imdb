I have not seen a lot of low-budget movies, I must admit, but it's the worst movie of all time, the old man's main character was talking like he had a lobotomy and had lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds. years could act better. The story had the most hideous plot, and the army guy put what he thought was an army, then went over, I only looked at him for laughing at the gravity of the situation and I hoped it would lead to the real movie. I can not believe it was under rent for 2 nights at blockbusters, instead of one please take this for free and get it out of sight. I think there was an almost decent actor other than the woman, I think the only thing that suited the budget was makeup, but they show all the important scenes of the film at the very beginning of the music. Horrible simply horrible.
