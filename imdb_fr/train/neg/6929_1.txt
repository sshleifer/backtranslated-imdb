I read the reviews on this movie and decided to give it a try. After all, I am an open minded guy and I have given good reviews to very bad movies. At the end of the credits, I was looking for a meaning and a good thing to say. Here is: "This movie was fortunately short." It is all I have. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped to give the atmosphere of the asylum life, but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogues had taken away. I found myself laughing at this film but how you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd. <br /> <br /> At the time of the "chicken dance" in the final I had just decided to roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. The acting was not bad and there seemed to be a budget, but there was no way to make it visible; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. I might have had to trigger a doobie or drink a lot of beer to get a full movie experience. Anyway, I'm not watching this movie unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say, "At least I was not in 'Dr. Torture Dungeon of Tarr. 'I'm better than these guys.'
