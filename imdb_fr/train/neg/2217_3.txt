As one fake Russian scientist tells us two-thirds of the film, "I came for science". This sums up pretty well why I watched this movie - anything involving a half-man, half-hammerhead shark certainly deserves serious empirical investigation from an aspiring neutral scientist. Or, as they say in the biz, my girlfriend's brother had the remote and the rest belongs to the story. To say that the special effects were bad would be a bad service for the field of special effects. We are in 2005, it is not so difficult to film a car scene without blues background on the screen. Yes, it was charming and cutting-edge when Hitchcock was shooting "The Birds", but in 2005 it seemed like a small budget. Save me the inexpensive attempt at Sci-Fi and give me the service of trying to voluntarily suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, after having seriously defamed the general concept of this film, let me tell you again, as sad as it may seem, it is probably worth it. If nothing else, it's a stunt of bad science fiction - training for the new movie buff and certainly a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies during their day. <br /> <br /> Crazy Hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it's a good idea to pour sips of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the 'intelligence of mankind, but also the ability of movie writers' B' to find Plausible plot. <br /> <br /> This film also responds to one of my long-standing disagreements: The bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it was not 2005, I'm not mistaken about the fact that this film was a kind of incredibly poor metaphor of the cold war. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon bird of prey inserting leachate into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines of the film is the one where the bra-free girl insists that the Charlton Heston look-alike, "wait for Tom" as he tries to lift the helicopter soil evacuation. The problem is that Tom is wasting the nasty sunglasses with his eternal banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in simple terms. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist says towards the end of the film, "my goal is to evolve the human species" - suffice it to say that this film only contributed to a devolution of humanity. The weak Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepared the protagonist to mate with a hammerhead shark are just a reminder that even in the worst of science fiction, we can all find something to laugh about.
