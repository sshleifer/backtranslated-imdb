Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles. This film is fantastic. Vampire witches fighting in dreadfully choreographed scenes and dialogues that could have broken ribs of laughter. Plan 9 of OUterSpace gives no chance against that. Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece - he is English and very sarcastic. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Beaton and the producers know what will save them from bankruptcy by using multiple times. Although it leaves me cold because it looks more like the undead than all the devil breeders. And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira. Everything is badly done. <br /> <br /> Take a good look at the script
