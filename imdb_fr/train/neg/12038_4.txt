Is something happening in this movie? There are only short and weird scenes where I did not know what was going on so it does not matter. This film is so boring it hurts, and it comes from a person who loves it when movies are made to make movies. Confused ?, Well I was after watching this shit. On what was Donald Sutherland, because it was missing him completely. And what is with the scene "pedofile" at the beginning of the film. Can put anyone to sleep! 4/10
