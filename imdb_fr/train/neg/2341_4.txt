Okay ... it seems that so far only Barman fans have commented on this film - the time has come for a counterpoint. Be careful, this writing is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (especially non-Belgians): Tom Barman, director of this film, is the singer of dEUS, one of the best known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. Basically, they made two very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly became famous nationwide. Then, the egos started to hurt and the group practically collapsed, while Barman and a few others stayed to make albums under the label of EUS-Monicker. As always happens in such cases, the post-ventilation dEUS was much more docile and less interesting than the original. In 1999, they attempted an international breakthrough with their album "The Ideal Crash", which presented a much more diluted form of their earlier musical composition style. They have not quite succeeded. However, the egos were still big enough, it seems big enough for Barman to consider himself an artist enough to try films. <br /> <br /> More often than not, this kind of thing is a VERY big mistake, and that film is no exception. And Barman clearly opted for * art * on this one, another very big mistake. On the one hand, he's a musician, not a director. On the other hand, dEUS at its best has had fun and provoked music, but never anything that I would consider as 'art'. It shows. <br /> <br /> So, what is this film about? Basically, it tells the story of a group of completely uninteresting people, who do equally uninteresting things during a totally uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, while even more uninteresting things happen to them under the act to be without interest. The characters are superficial, the plot is totally useless and the film has no other redeeming quality to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and managed to cause a single laugh of 5 seconds (not loud enough). Atmosphere? The film does not seem to show emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) the idea of ​​"The Wind Man", which inspired the film's name, is as captivating as a pepper and banana pizza - not very, and was made a thousand times before (we remember Johny Destiny - one of the worst appearances of Tarantino on the movie so far) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). Well, it's * artistic *, so do not expect real action to make up for all the above. In other words, apart from the few smiles, it bothered me with my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is quite good, even if it suffers from the same problems as those recently appeared in OST: first, the film is more like an advertisement for the CD. Second, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the film's weaknesses and lack of emotional content behind the quality of the song content, which just does not work. In the end, the movie no longer looks like an illustration of the songs. And unfortunately, it's the bartenders' own contribution to the soundtrack that gets the most attention, although it's the weakest part of the entire soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. Overall, this shows that Barman knows more about music than movies. The work with the camera is good too, although nothing else would make you scream for joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that made me watch was the postman. Since I'm from Antwerp, it was fun to play some kind of "guess the location" game. I hardly think of it as a quality. <br /> <br /> In the end, another chance is lost for the flemish film. I see that lately, the best Belgian films come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because at least they have something to say and manage to say it in both a lively and emotional way (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Maybe Flemish artistic directors should also try.
