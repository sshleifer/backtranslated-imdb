An ambitious ambitious science fiction by Kerry Conran, for whom it is clearly a work of love. Unfortunately, it's just not so good. It all starts pretty well - with an epic but limited score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock montages and the brilliant film of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many novels, series and sci-fi movies on paper, as varied as The Day the Earth Stops, Superman, Metropolis, The Planet of the Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and L 'Spy who loves me. However, the film is not as good as this one for several reasons: the main one being that it is a work of love, so anxious to throw everything on the screen and create a new world brave, Conran forgets to actually make a film. Despite aerial battles, dinosaurs and fixed points against the clock, tension, atmosphere or magic are rare. Even the black elements fall flat. This is a general way of seeing things - these elements fail mainly because nothing seems real and is so wrong - the green screen looks like a video game half the time and it is obvious that the actors were glued after . . The actors do not do much either - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is boring and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and all because of a horrible scenario - the kind that has to explain almost everything. It's a decent experience and some might feel nostalgic, but it's finally a useless step in the world of yesterday. Nice ending though.
