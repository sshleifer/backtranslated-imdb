I jumped at the opportunity to see this film unbroken and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves. But every time it looked like it was going to get really scary, he would step back and go somewhere else. Drops of water in the house, black rain, prophetic dreams, untreated wastewater treatment errors were dropped before they could scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The mask of Chamberlain's almost inexpressive face offered a confused but confused incredulity, which I found in the image of the film. What might have been odd aboriginal songs and instruments in the background was rather a cacophony apparently designed to strike terror. The ideas that modern peoples may embody ancient gods, and that Aboriginal people believe that white-haired, red-haired men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are conveyed more like a shopping list than as an allusion to another dimension (The Dream Time). <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, what the director was trying to say was unclear. Is there a big wave? So what? What size? A tsunami? Yeah OK. It's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? This should be a damn big wave. Why? Was the world so bad a place? It did not look so bad in this movie. In fact, I did not think the wave had dissipated, because the shadow had left Burton's face that had been projected by the wave. Was it just the apocalypse of Burton? Heck, it happens every day to people who lose it. It had no point if it was only him. <br /> <br /> The scariest scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, took place in Charlie's apartment where Burton went to confront the old man. man to scare Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him "Who are you?" and it becomes really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed.
