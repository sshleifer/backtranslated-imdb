I saw this film in the first theatrical release, in a theater that was deservedly empty. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one remains clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors is well below the standard set by any group of randomly drunk high school students who have been forced to learn their aftershocks 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a moment, each scene reaching a new low. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure faded away and it became really sad.
