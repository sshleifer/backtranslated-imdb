When I listened to the morning news for the first time, I thought, "Wow, well, a little entertainment." It was a little fun for about a week ... But we must admit that these journalists (if we can even call them that) have a lot of "time to play". <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have a journalist in it. She is very unprofessional. She continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform viewers of a certain story. It has become so annoying that I can not look at it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she is no longer a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. As a result, she instantly becomes a celebrity among the celebrities she is supposed to interview. She is not very professional and probably considers that her relationship with celebrities is more important than her legitimately insatiable journalistic status - and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> In addition (unfortunately), this show has more reporting necessary on the world, the government, the United States or something that will benefit and / or serve the best interests of the public. They are too focused on sensationalism because everything they talk about is considered a commercial product. On the other hand, their reporters in the field are quite interesting ... <br /> <br /> I think "Good Day LA" is for young teens and celebrities, and it's certainly not for people who are really interested in the news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would really rather like to watch KTLA, but they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes, they're still a little bland.) Oh, well, I'll stick to NBC "Today, ABC's" Good Morning America "is also acceptable ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not get too serious.)
