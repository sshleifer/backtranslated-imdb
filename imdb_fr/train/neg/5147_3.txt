"Blue Desert" may have had the potential to be a half-plausible thriller and more enjoyable if the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) had not been so stupid. When she is the victim of a new attack on the streets of New York, the cartoon Roberts moves to a small town in the West. In her early days there, she meets Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this role well), who is strangely crazy and will eventually leave her. Fearing for her safety after having been twice in the situation, she formed a friendship and a relationship with the city police officer, suspiciously friendly, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough, leaving the disbelief among viewers convinced of red herring launched by writers). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because, he tells her, Atkins is an ex-convict and a culprit of sexual assault. But the police did not have enough evidence to send him away. <br /> <br /> The film had enough stratagems to at least make an interesting movie, because pretty quickly there is such confusion that Roberts should trust. However, much of the anticipated suspense seems too forced because Roberts' character never seems to react to simple things as any reasonable person thinks. And his late responses allow much of this suspense to happen easily and unconvincingly, especially in the finale. Maybe Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; Too much baby has faced ways that recall the character of Kevin Anderson evident in his character in "Sleeping With the Enemy". Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, that might be enough. In the meantime, the film is not so great, even as a low-budget B thriller.
