From the opening dialogue and the scenes, I knew that I knew I was looking for a shipwreck. I did not want to look, but I could not turn away. If it were not the case, I would have given a star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the relational behavior has so far been exaggerated, added by a mediocre direction and a horrible story, makes this film nothing more than a disaster at low budget. Money is certainly not a necessity for making a good movie. But this film fails so horribly that there was no chance of bouncing back. <br /> <br /> If you were stuck in the woods, your childhood best friend dying of an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stuck in a strange What would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Flee everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) have sex with the girlfriend of your friends. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows and shave your legs. D.) Hit your childhood best friend's head and crush him with a shovel all your life. E.) All the above answers. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so exaggerated.

The total absence of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throw this film into the bone basket of your local rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
