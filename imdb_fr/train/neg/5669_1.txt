The director, dressed in chains and leather, warned the audience of the SF Frameline Film Festival Friday evening that we were going to see an "experimental" film. Experimental? Leave the video camera in the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and mount anything that is useless to view. A sinuous pastiche road show missed that starts nowhere and takes no place for the public. The gratuitous violence that opens the film has led more than one client of the Castro Theater. I would have left too, but my filmmaker needed a return home and was worried about seeing the worst until the end. By the time the lights went out, the audience had considerably thinned. Warm applause. Pro forma questions from the director who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
