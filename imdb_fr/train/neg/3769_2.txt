There have been many movies featuring Bigfoot, most of which are not good, but most have at least a crazy charm. Sasquatch Hunters does not even have that. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters talks about a group of paleontologists, primatologists and rangers venturing into a remote area of ​​the Pacific Northwest Forest. Bones belonging to a kind of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and, as great apes are not natural in North America, this leads to a scientific expedition. Of course, they soon discover a graveyard filled with skeletal remains of these huge creatures resembling monkeys. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb old burial places in movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is composed of uninteresting and interchangeable characters who assemble their equipment, walk in the woods, stop at rest. go a little further to the woods, take a break long enough to examine and discover some discoveries along the way, but browse it further, look for a member of the group that has disappeared, continue to browse the woods, dig into the land, randomly theorize and gather around a campfire to discuss the little they did that day. When Sasquatch shows up at last, he just turns into a person who stumbles in the dark while being stopped one by one (all in the blink of an eye and you've missed him in fashion and murder takes place off camera). All this is extremely boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to create suspense, but there is nothing to find. So we stay with sad and stretched scenes of people wandering in the woods just to go somewhere and wander the woods at night trying to act out of fear. I would be lying if I said that I did not use the fast forward button to speed up those scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, like all the other characters in the film, he does not have much to do and lacks a distinct personality. It sounds like a more refined version of King Kong, which is not that bad, except in the scenes where they used the CGI instead of a man in Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during daytime monster scenes. Part of me can not help thinking that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a bit of a sacrilege. If there is only one movie monster that I think should only materialize in the situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that does not have so much intrigue as premise. . That's all you need, a principle that the people involved have come up with to make a feature film without worrying about adding all the ingredients to make an interesting movie.
