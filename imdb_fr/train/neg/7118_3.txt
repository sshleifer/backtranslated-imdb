I could not tell if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a scam at Hitchcock or a modernized homage by Edgar Allen Poe. These days, someone would have cut it a little bit and presented it as one of those television anthology episodes of the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after an extensive rewrite. <br /> <br /> What's sad is that there seems to be a nice and nasty little story trying to escape under the rubble of this movie, and the actors obviously do their best with their talent and the material with which they must work. But the director simply did not know how to go up or beat a dramatic scene; the special effects simply did not work; the scenario telegraphed so clearly that the bivalves could have seen them arrive; and the soundtrack continued to play German "oompah band" music when she was supposed to try to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they really tried. But I guess a very young person who has not seen a lot of suspense or horror could charge against "Screaming Skull", but such a young person would probably not understand most of the subtext motivation or conspiracy. ("Mom, why is this nice man trying to scare the cowardly cat with a crooked face?")
