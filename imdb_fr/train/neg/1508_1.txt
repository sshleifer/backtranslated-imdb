I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me from staying in my place. I guess I was just expecting a movie with Gere to be worth it, but nothing good has ever been on the screen. The story is a stupid excuse to pile up, ball and slavery. No character in the movie is like real life. The "style" of cutting is based on jumping cups, mini-backs and overprint to give weight to this insipid set of a gang of sadists apparently free for years and the SURPRISE leader is the " victim "of an executed murderer. I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent and sexist basket.
