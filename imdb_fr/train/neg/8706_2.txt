If you live for the first time the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen a "moving image", you will think that this film is a child of the gods. BUT if you have seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney the Dinosaur, you will not be very impressed by this movie. Heck Barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinosaurs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I like B movies. I just watched "Gila's Giant Monster" just before watching this failure, and I really enjoyed this movie. It works like a movie B. It has a dialogue, an action game, a cheesier effects and an honest god of my real Gila monster! Carno 3 just does not have much success in movie B. It has a bit of gore, and this guy from Polchek has been pretty funny a few times but this film is disappointing, almost ... flabby. It's the little engine that could not dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch the gum dry on a sidewalk and be entertained. If you are one of these people, give a shot to this movie.
