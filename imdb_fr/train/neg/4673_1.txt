I love the books of Henry James and Washington Square is no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie based on the book of this title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin has enough talent to play the lead role. Albert Finney is a bad idea and has a bad role. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her idiotic and tasteless role. The real problem and what's missing in this latest version is a good script, good music and good direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep at the theater watching this long film, extremely long and exceptionally boring. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book, I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also hated the twist in which his aunt has a sexual attraction for Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> Look if you can not sleep, it's a definitive snoozer. Do not look if you are depressed. After that, you will need Zoloft. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the lead roles. The actor who played his father was on the mark as a cold and indifferent father ... still in mourning for his wife dead and hating Catherine for that. The film was not faithful to the book, but it was not true either. <br /> <br /> This movie was a failure at the counter. I have no doubt as to why.
