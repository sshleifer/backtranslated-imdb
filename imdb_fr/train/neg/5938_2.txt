if you did not live in the 90s or never listen to the rapper !! this film might be suitable for you, but for all fans or anyone who has heard rap, this movie was boring and there was no reason in the movie where I said it was interesting or I did not. did not know. Another thing that bothered me was that it gave the impression that everything he had done in his life was very easy, there was no difficulty making the prison easier, selling drugs and even strike unfairly. I think that if the film is released in about 15 years, it may have more impact! good rap movies jostle, get rich or die trying not to become notorious
