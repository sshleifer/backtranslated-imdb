A woman asks for advice on the road to a mysterious city and hears two macabre stories of the bizarre local, both related to a zombie. But maybe fate also has something unpleasant about it ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles are absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must admit that it is so serious, I quickly advanced most of the waste. And there were many, believe me. It only lasts 69 minutes and there is still tons of charge. You have skinheads that do a lot of push-ups, a lot of boring kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (it rhymes, tee hee) and some nice examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> for the characters in the title, they barely have a footnote in the film. Why, you have more undead action in the intro than in the previous feature! However, considering how the eyes that come out of the eyes and the sequences that eat the brain are pathetic (among other "delights"), it may be a blessing disguised. <br /> <br /> And to top it off, it seems that likes to have been filmed on the cell phone of someone for broadcast on Youtube. Camera jerky, scratches on the print, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, not in 1971. Even the clothes and the fashioned clothes seem outdated for three decades! > <br /> If you think I'm not qualified to review Chronicles who have not seen the whole movie, then do not hesitate. YOU try to sit through it, I bet you will not even succeed in the first appearance of the smartie blue monsters before apologizing and leaving. It's really laughable that anyone has chosen to release it, and honestly, you'll have a lot more fun putting your drink on the record than torturing your DVD player with this huge excuse for horror. In fact, do not be surprised if your bags are stowed and taken out in the morning, you will be doomed to watch VHS tapes all your life. You've been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S What kind of horror rated 18 on a woman did she keep a massive sports bra during the forced sex scene ?! You see, the film can not even understand this part ...
