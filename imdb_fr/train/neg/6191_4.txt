I watched this film, along with all other possible adaptations, including plays, in preparation for academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as is music. Unfortunately, all life has been removed from history. I have never seen such a horrible portrait of Mr. Rochester. All of his most basic traits have disappeared. Where is his mind? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester is more like Rochester's film, St.John, than the character of the novel. In fact, the actor who plays St.John in this adaptation has played a passionate St.John while Scott is content to break objects or look at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they thought. I would like to give this film a slightly higher vote because of the wonderful music and cinematography, but honestly, I can not stand to see this movie too long because of the performance of George C. Scott.
