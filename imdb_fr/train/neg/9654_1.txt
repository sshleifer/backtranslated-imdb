The movie is just bad. Simply horrible. The series of bad Bollywood movies has no end! They must be running out of excuses to make such horrendous movies (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to concern principally the directors. This film has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver a great performance ... but they have been misdirected. The poor script did not help either. <br /> <br /> This film has many ridiculous moments and a very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan met Om Puri (whom he had escaped 30 years ago and spoke again) and all that Om Puri found to say is to be wary. of his friendship with Salman !!! What a load of shit. Seriously. Not to mention the soundtrack of baaad. What happened with Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is a pure misunderstanding for describing a rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only the good results of the second half are welcomed. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. Just like Salman, the addict. <br /> <br /> Look at it maybe only during the last half hour.
