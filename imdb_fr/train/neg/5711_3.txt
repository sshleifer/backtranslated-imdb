The National Treasury is about as overrated and over-excited as it is. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". People who have compared this film to the classic Indian Jones trilogy have seriously fallen out of their rocker. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what kind of target audience this movie was intended for. It may please the preadolescent public, but I found it completely ridiculous. Nor can I imagine that adults or young adults find this film so great. In other words, it is at best acceptable. <br /> <br /> The national treasure is neither imaginable nor inspired, borrowing the "Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for the release of this film in 2006 and convey this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The very idea of ​​being able to fly the Declaration of Independence so easily and to travel through Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (without ever damaging it) while fighting the "bad guys" and Experimenting with what is supposed to be a "non-stop action" is absurd. I particularly liked the scene with the statement folded in its tube that lies in the middle of a busy road while cars whistle without damaging it. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> It reminded me of this episode of "Brady Bunch" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except that this episode of Brady Bunch was much better than all this movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such an immense treasure that no one believes he is buried in a secret United States ruin is strange. Literally, there are thousands of "inestimable" objects not found in this treasure. Yes indeed!! Ridiculous!! Worse still, the speed and accuracy with which Cage finds and determines what are supposedly "hard" clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterior !!! Oh humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and the other actors of "National Treasure" are as steep, wooden and flat as they are. However, when you work with such an ugly dialogue, it's hard to blame the actor 100%. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an acceptable movie to see once. I can not recommend it beyond that and I certainly would not buy this over a strange and disastrous treasure hunt. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you have to see it first .......
