I saw this movie "hot" when it came out in 1986. It had an X rating for a brief scene of oral sex but played in traditional theaters (it was a film "art"). Supposedly, this is the first movie to show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a boring tale about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) in love (rightly) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As it was mentioned before, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body BUT she also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) rather poor. No wonder he never made another movie. Despite everything, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but rather brief), it is a slow and moving story that bores me stupidly. The good action of Detmers only helped to a certain extent. Most of the time, I looked at my watch waiting patiently for it to finish. If he did not have this sequence, this film would have been forgotten for a long time. Dull and slow. You can skip this one.
