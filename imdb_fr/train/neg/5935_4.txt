The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including Nick Cave, otherwise incredibly talented) seem to have missed all the point where Cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines in a balance almost unparalleled, Cohen conveys the full extent of his poetry, irony, total humanity, laughter and tears. <br /> <br /> To see some of these new singers making convoluted grimaces, toss their pathetic cries in the patiently screaming effort "I'm a singer!" is a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably heard some horrible opera versions of simple songs such as Lennon's "Imagine". Nothing, simply nothing comes close to the simplicity and openness of the original. If there is an art form that does not need embellishment, it is Cohen's art. The ornaments throw him on the street, resembling the tasteless makeup of sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Cohen, I found myself in pain and through pitiful tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all completely missing from the original The irony of the master and, in truth, many of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at an asylum talent show. It is up to Cohen to pay tribute to them by allowing them to sing his material, in fact, and not the other way around: whether they are friends or those of his daughter, he could have become very tender and want to make a gift . Too bad he does not stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but at the very end, Cohen himself interpreted his majestic "Song Tower", but even that flower was spoiled by a totally incongruous background. U2 group, all wearing the expression that children bore when they visit their poor grandfather at the retirement home. <br /> <br /> A sad, really, and sad spectacle if you really like Cohen like me.
