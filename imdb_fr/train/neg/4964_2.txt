This film is a joke! The names are grossly mis-spoken and the plot is twisted and transformed into something incomprehensible to any lover of literature. And they have the nerve to give Beowulf a ridiculous gun / crossbow. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, he pulls Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can not believe the writers did such a thing. The way Grendel is described is impressive. This and the casting are the only positives of the feature. My English teacher would go crazy if she saw this abomination. Unless you are a fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this movie at all costs. And even then, I would not recommend it.
