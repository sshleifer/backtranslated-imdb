Val Kilmer, a solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, a solid performance. Three very engaging actors giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Notorious for its riches, an addict and a guy who, despite AIDS, continues to make adult movies, does not create an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events that preceded and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder in the late 1980s in Los Angelos to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder and who was finally been acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the guilt factor, regardless of outcome, was quite high in the "He did it" area. <br /> <br /> There is no one with whom to sympathize in this film, as everyone is a selfish criminal. There is nothing interesting here.
