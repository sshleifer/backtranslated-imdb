Every film from the 1930s is dated, but if you only watched John Ford movies, it would seem more dated than watching others. that is, the Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, it is always difficult to sell someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always overestimate the villain of some heavy. Always poorly designed, clumsy and obvious scripts. This is not an exception. It's just a pretty sophisticated device to give feeling. And feeling is all we have to do. <br /> <br /> What Ford is doing here does not make me appreciate Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the United States was colonized by the population of complete morons described here. . Ford has continued to make decent films. It's too old-fashioned to be anything but bad. It's completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is weird. And no one from Illinois would say 'S', or say "Shonuff!"
