No, it was not one of the worst ten films of the 80s, but it is certainly beyond the last 100. It looks like this film was put on the shelf for two or three years, then released in 1981. How else to explain the special effects prior to "An American werewolf in London", disco still considered cool and Ronald Reagan the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it, let's not forget the hairstyles of the '50s and' 60s. I've seen more here than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" together. <br /> <br /> The woman who raised this film in the category "Too bad is good" was the end, great Elizabeth Hartman, but hardly. Biff plays Miss Montgomery, the high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that has been destroyed and is still being defeated by Hollywood, but still retains its mouse qualities. His call for help is proof of that. She also looks much better at Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars at the beauty salon, shot in hell." She did not joke. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good roles elsewhere, they are few and far between, and I do not say that because I like Hartman. Incidentally, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and it was not even so good. <br /> <br />
