Heavenly Days is doing a serious comedy drama: it's hopeless to give us a lesson in civic education, and it will not stop until we have passed the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly go on a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), discuss with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), meet a a crowd of annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he was considered an almost communist dupe, but in 1944 he was OK. Add to that really awful musical moments, a host of worries and a boring secondary plot about reporters, and you get a movie that had to prepare Philip Wylie to Generate Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Funnily disunited, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
