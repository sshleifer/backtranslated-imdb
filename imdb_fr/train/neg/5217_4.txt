Meet Peter Houseman, Rock Star Professor at Virgina University. When he does not play on the field, he blows into the spirits and drops underwear during his class lectures. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells, allowing humans to become immortal. I would also be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet feminine love that only VU can offer. An assortment of ugly and ugly college professors do not care about the famous Houseman and cut funding for his project for lack of results. This leads Peter to use himself as a guinea pig for his serum. To my astonishment, there are side effects and he, understand that, is changing! in something that is enshrined in our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "millions of years". He is also sleeping Sally, Dr. Mike, after a whole day of getting to know her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry little boy. <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis is not a terrible film, but it is not well produced. Throughout the time I watched this, I could not forget the fact that it was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the film is of the quality of the seventies at the latest. It does not help it to be packed with the movies of the 70s, because Metamorphosis is one of the 50 scary classics of Mill Creek. There is basically no difference in movie quality. The last five minutes are a pure film of bad film which, for me at least, saves the film of a lower note. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "cromosonic anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can not spell! This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.
