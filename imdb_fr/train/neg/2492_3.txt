I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it a 3, but it's hard to remember what they could have been !! Maybe Xtro (nasty and dull) or possibly Creep (just dull), but it's hard to think of anything worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's say it is the seat of a poor man, with Jean Claude Van Damme, a man even poorer. Casper Van Dien was the only thing that bought. I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> If we judge by this site, it is stuck in the hell of television ... Casper, be more selective ... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just shot and there's a half-decent film called Criminal Law ...... now I'm getting really resentful of the last half hours !!!
