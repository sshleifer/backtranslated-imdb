Can A-Pix ever, ever, ever do anything good? This film was to be seen on television in a mailbox format. As A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see entire scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks to a shoulder on the right side. Of course, not that you miss a lot. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie where the characters scream loudly for 80% of the movie for no reason.
