It's one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is largely due to factual improbability (for example, an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while showing that he is talking to someone through a wire connection or scene where scientists assume that it is safe to enter a room where the virus has been released even if "he has not found a viable host" does not mean he will never find it), sets cheap (the bank seems to have been poorly constructed to look like a dungeon), and bad behavior. This is the story of an organized criminal group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the deadly virus. However, the manager who decides to remove him from the safe of a bank does so at the same time that a bank hold-up is collapsing, that FBI agents have been informed of this and that a terrible earthquake occurs. Needless to say, the consequences of the earthquake are disastrous in more ways than one. However, the results do not make an attractive action movie, but rather a movie that has been clearly a Z-class junk food since the beginning of the movie. (This may be why some of the screenshots on the package appear to be created with computer graphics rather than actual screenshots from different movie clips). What Ron Perlman did in there, I have no idea. I wonder if he was as embarrassed to be there as I would have looked at him.
