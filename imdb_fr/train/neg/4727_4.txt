This film is really a priest's egg, good in places. Unlike other reviews, I found that the main flaw of this technique is its inability to attract the interest of the viewer for the characters and the plot. I sat through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and group dynamics, but if I had to evaluate it solely on the basis of its merit as a film, I should let it go, with some caveats: Jason Behr is good in the role of John Livien and very convincing as a rock singer; the story of his childhood trauma is unclear, although Livien's well-organized relationships with his parents are revealed to us, but his behavior is ultimately strange to the viewer (which should not be the case). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using a stage character to solve inner conflicts is interesting, even if it is neither new nor fully explored as a theme of this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I admit that I am not a fan of the Beatles. Anyway, Livian and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in that they had something derived from them. Another frustrating thing about the film is the way it opened up with interesting philosophical reflections - albeit middle-level and high school - of the main character, but he left the threads of his thought there, for the resume again in the middle of the film very briefly, when Livian says, "before God, there was music" (never saw this advertisement for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "before the time, there was Tia Maria "That's what I thought anyway); it seems like an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he did it, but he is entitled to it. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, skilfully interpreted by Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the mistake of this thought when he answers "You do not know it". <br /> <br /> Overall, the limited force of direction and intrigue could go into future projects, in an unfounded banality or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
