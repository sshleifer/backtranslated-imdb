After the disastrous revolution, this film was the final nail of Goldcrest's coffin and thus of the British film industry. The film is an absolute pant, it is full of jazz rebirth music of the mid-80s and is based on a book and an author that were briefly popular at the time and have rightfully fallen back into obscurity . Temple searched for centuries for Suzette and invented Patsy Kensett, another person who was briefly popular at the time. By the time the film was released from post-production, the revival of jazz was over, so had Kensett's career and the film met an audience totally indifferent to cinema. <br /> <br /> The mediocre would be an overestimate for some of the worst / worst camps. The best actor to ever see the big British screen watching it nearly 20 years later and the movie is really crazy.
