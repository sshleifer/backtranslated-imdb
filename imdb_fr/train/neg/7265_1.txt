I just saw that at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have trouble sleeping. It's a movie full of pretensions - it starts with a minor quote of "Hiroshima my love" and everything is downhill from there. Camera work - Imagine a child imitating Wong Kar Wai. Scenario - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "The love I saw in You were just a mirage" went from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but filled with rehearsals. For scary pains, this movie is one of the benches of the Methodist church where my parent dragged me when I was a kid. I want more than 2 hours of my life reimbursed. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the screening by saying that the film was "controversial" - this is only true for the film's narcotic effect.
