Boring. Minimum plot. No character development. I went in this movie with great expectations of the book. It could have been a great movie. It probably could have become a cult classic. No, it was a giant disappointment. It was badly launched and had horrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels or the military or the church or all? Some mini-intrigues of the film leave me still perplexed. I am stunned about certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never really EXPLAINED. I felt like I was watching a nerdy episode of a mini-series on the science fiction channel. It looked a lot like a movie made for television. Do not go see this movie. It's a waste of time AND money.
