An interesting idea (four African-American women crushed under the heel of the company takes revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by the horribly slow leadership of F. Gary Gray and an atrocious scenario (written by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full unexpectedly funny moments. Instead of commenting on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men are cruelly insulted and humiliated, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to inflict notions of lyrical tragedy on their unsuspecting public. It's melodrama at its worst. Gray puts his actors above every tired line and John Carter's lazy montage refuses to take over, instead choosing to keep his camera trained on the perplexed faces of the performers. And they are amused: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have a raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress, she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand than Gray to guide them. As a result, they are perceived as uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away.
