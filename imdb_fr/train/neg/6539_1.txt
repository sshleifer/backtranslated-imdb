If it could be evaluated at 0, it would be. From the excruciating wooden actor's play to the dull and painful look, to the childish exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudosbian titillation, solely for the pleasure of sad spectators, it is the plot of a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, from the beginning, we are absolutely certain of what will happen to all the characters and the unfolding of the plot. From a boring and unusual beginning to a pathetic and dark end, every presence in this film is ruined and every meager piece of talent found for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something as indefatigable as ever with the same childish titillation, watch one of Ilsa movies. At least they are without excuse and at the beginning of what they are trying to do. How has something so horribly bad ever been able to be above 5, a miracle of how people without taste or indiscretion can sometimes meet for very questionable purposes. <br /> <br /> This is not scary, it is not interesting, and above all it does not excite the meaning of the word at all. It is, in my opinion, a crime. It is a crime that such horribly offensive and incompetent waste has ever been conceived and endowed with the resources to exist, let alone a tragedy that is still defended by lamentably misguided viewers. <br /> <br /> Even Elvira's cheerful personality and her jokes would not diminish the shock of this horrible movie parody. Avoid it at all costs.
