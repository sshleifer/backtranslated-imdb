This movie had some big actors! Unfortunately, they had forgotten how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better, but the acting was so robotic that it was doomed from the beginning. In fact, it appeared that actors might be reading a scenario all the time. Maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is certain, the makeup artist must have another job! The face powder was so thick that you could see it coming off the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it has never been released in theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods, shame on you for not giving everything. The plot was awesome just needed a lot more.
