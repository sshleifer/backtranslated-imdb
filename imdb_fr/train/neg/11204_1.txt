:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was awful. A Catholic / superstitious / thriller thriller that dates back to previous films. <br /> <br /> The priest who doubted. Sex and Priesthood. Politics and religion. Hypocrisy of the church. Plot involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of voodoo fights of black magic between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Quite stupid and lame with a weak scenario to suffice. The story revolves around two concepts: absolution, better known as the sacrament of the anointing of the sick - the last rights a person can ask to be cleansed of his sins on the verge of death; And excommunication, the act of cutting off a person from the Church. Basically, an excommunicated person can not receive Absolution. So happens the Sin Eater, and I'll leave it there. Add all the doping things I have already listed and you have "the Order". <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene with the priest intertwined with shots of an image of the Virgin Mary rather insulting to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I paraphrase) "I am the Redeemer and damning sins, I live without love blah blah blah" / the cue walking down a dark alley with a long coat went "The Matrix". <Br/> <br /> I attributed to this movie a 1 to not only be zero and unoriginal, but also because it managed to insult a lot of confidence in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
