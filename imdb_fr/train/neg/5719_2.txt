This movie is a bit like the movie Hostel, except with * BAD * and less suspense. The gore elements are there, but you do not feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence very inefficient. Some parts are just strange ... like forcing a snake into someone's throat. What's up with that? Is it supposed to be scary or bloody? It's just a little stupid. As for the torture, there is not really (except the guy who was burned at first, which they do not show anyway). The main villain keeps saying "let them die slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. The dead are all relatively fast. Yes, I watched the "unclassified" version. So all in all, not the worst gore movie I've seen, but not at all good either. You will not miss anything if you skip this one.
