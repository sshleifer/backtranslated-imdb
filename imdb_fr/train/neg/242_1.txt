From an ill-conceived plot that makes almost no sense, to a bad dialogue, from incoherent scenes to ultimate despair, bad acting (even Peter Falk can not find his way) " is better to leave John Find ". Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion, as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as a love interest for Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single father Noah is almost unbearable to watch and even less to listen to sing. But who can blame them with material like this? Michael J. Murray's script is at best juvenile. <br /> <br /> Every year, at this hour, I'm looking for television guides and I'm looking forward to seeing some really classic Christmas and inspiring holiday movies on the small screen. Films like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delicious "The shop around the corner" and, of course, the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There are Frank Capra's classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift is a tip. Your time would be better spent searching for these movies than finding "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
