...... this movie is really horrible, the only thing that prevented me from giving it a score of 1 is that I have unfortunately seen worse. <br /> <br /> The music of the jungle, the jutter demons, and the fluorescent UV / blood / teeth / eye style gives it that "awful" look, and the scenario is disastrous ..... this movie is plus a test to see how long you can last before giving up. It is also predictable but not in a good way. Nothing of this film is going in the right direction. I watched it 10 minutes ago and I thought I'd make a small comment so here it is. (oh and the game does not drop the movie, it's also terrible)
