It's a really terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I only write it so that some people are pushed back somewhere. If I prevent someone from wasting a precious part of his life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Needlessly monotonous, although, considering the film starring Al Pacino, I felt that something will happen. The credits are then passed, and I realized that I was completely duped to look at this incredible stupidity. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie got a score as high as IMDb (more than 5 stars saw the vote for the last time). Are you voting ironically? <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, please.
