Very bad acting and a very superficial story. Not even a decent movie B <br /> <br /> Events that were supposed to be shocking, as if humans were boarding an alien ship were boring and very lame. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst Sci-Fi I've ever seen. I saw the stars 5.0 and decided to watch it because I like the genre, but it was really bad. Now there are really very few good movies on ALIEN, I think because most of them are small budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
