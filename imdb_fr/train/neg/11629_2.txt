** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, lacks intrigue, and was only done to see the stars represent themselves. The most moving scene of the film took place when Shabana Azmi is in the shower, then we see her television playing the shower scene of PSYCHO. This film actually expected that the character of Naseeruddin Shah had enough memory to remember where some shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer leaves Shabana Azmi his guts long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to hit him! <br /> <br /> *** END OF THE SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> At first, it's a bit humorous to hear the director and cast members insult and hear Shabana Azmi exclaim: "Oh, hush!" <br /> <br /> Overall, a movie baaaaaaaaaaad! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** on ********** (2 of 10)
