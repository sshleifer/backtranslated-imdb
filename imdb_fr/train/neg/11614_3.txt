The Lady in Cement is a real class of social anthropology of the late sixties. Writing, not acting, is at the center of the stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are a woman or a gay. Broad and lady are standard terms and gay bait and smear are represented for what they were in the day (camp). Most of the lines are rejected, although very few actors of exceptional characters have shown great performances. The action scenes are mundane but it's fun to watch Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes to denigrate the tough guys. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the peak of their voluptuous career. Amazing to note that they were both 28 years old and that Mr. Sinatra was 53 years old. The musical score, wait. . . was there a partition? Well, you have a point. Look at him with friends who want to laugh. it's full of them.
