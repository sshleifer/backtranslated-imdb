Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise, but I found that Europa '51 was one of the most overworked (and therefore boring) movies I have never seen. The film begins in a promising but familiar way, as Ingrid Bergman's mother is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (Alexander Knox, a bit bland) invite their guests to a dinner, the boy tries to commit suicide, setting off a series of upsetting events in which Bergman spends his time spreading compassion on the poor and the needy. At the instigation of Andrea (Ettore Giannini), editor-in-chief of the communist newspaper, she quickly spent more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon locked him in an insane asylum. Bergman plays the role of saint, recalling her role as Joan of Arc of 1948, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of enlightening and filming it at best. Unfortunately, the script marks its goal with a subtlety of hammer fist, while Andrea and Mama declaim in turn Marxist and Christian platitudes. In the last scene, filled with tears, these tired characters filled me up. A real step forward for Rossellini, who moved away from neorealism and was more interested in the mythical and mystical themes of the Flowers of St. Francis of the 1950s.
