This film features, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly the names that scream for "quality". And with skits as edifying as "Supermodels Taking a Dump" (that's exactly what it looks like), a guy who steals a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), a necrophilia with a rotting corpse, fetuses from the black market (with a guy who scoop is supposed to be them in a jar), lots of joking jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions. Sketches are painfully impossible (as in "Batman and Rhymer"), the acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is rude just to be brutal ... and stupid. I really believe that an 8 year old group could have easily made a funny movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film gave rise to a lawsuit of "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I would not know who to look in this case! Apparently, he alleged that Scientologists had destroyed his reputation and leaked the film. It does not matter that the movie is disgusting from beginning to end and that it is not funny at 99% (in comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> So, it's Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") who wears a diaper and participates in the fake dummy porn movie. It's amazing that his career can overcome that.
