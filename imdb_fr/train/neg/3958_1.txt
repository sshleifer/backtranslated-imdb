I will not waste a lot of time with this one because, in my opinion, it's not really a film to begin with, but a carefree mishmash of borrowed sequences and embarrassing new amateurish sequences made only for the movie . purpose to stick all the bazaar together and call it a sequel "Boogeyman". This film is literally stolen at 80% from its much superior predecessor, "The Boogeyman", a movie that the writers of this garbage did not even bother to watch because they could not even get the name of the original character of the actress Suzanna Love (Lacy) right. And to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as themselves. 0 out of 10 and I would like the rating system of IMDb to be so low, the most foolish and blatant attempt to scam money from people I've ever seen, YOU WERE TAKEN IN WARNING!
