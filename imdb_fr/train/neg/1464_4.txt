I watched this in the hope of discovering something that I did not know about the most infamous man in modern history and that I could not help but think that the story had been rewritten in HITLER : THE RISE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to be shot by one of his admirers. Hitler arrived with a weapon in his hand to stop Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but did the writers not confuse Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? It's bad enough, but what really offends me is that there is a lack of historical context in this mini-series. Germany lost the First World War and the Allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price. It was this economic environment that prompted the German people to ask someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s, caused by the Allied Powers, seems totally absent. HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL can not be taken seriously as a historical document, and I did not even mention that Himmler and Goering were remarkable. by their absence <br /> <br /> The mini-series has a positive point: it is Robert Carlyle who plays the main role. Okay, some of his manners are wrong and his voice is a little too loud (the records show that Hitler had a sweet and seductive voice) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he manages to communicate Hitler's own charisma to the screen. The comments in the British press that Carlyle is more like Sparks synthesizer than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the best interpretations of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I liked Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hated everything else. about this mini series and asked why the heck it was done in the first place. There is nothing to recommend to fans of serious history
