This entry is certainly interesting for the fans of the series (like me), but it is for the most part incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the continuity of the sequel. Some striking effects, of course, but we never find out what all of this really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the version "NC-17" which contains the gore that was cut to be re-evaluated "R".
