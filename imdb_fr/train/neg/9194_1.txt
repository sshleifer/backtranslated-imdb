Ok, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all of Romero's films and really enjoyed the Dawn of the Dead redesign. So when I heard all the critics criticize this film, I was always optimistic. I mean, the critics hated Resident Evil, and although it may not be a particularly good movie, I enjoyed it without the fact that it's just a fun zombie shoot-up. with a half-decent plot. This however, is pure shit. Terrible dialogue, half-conical plot and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing I liked in this movie (I use the term vaguely) is Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name casts the originality out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he is in a horrible movie and that he could just as well make the most of it. All others act as if they were doing Shakespeare. And very badly I could add. Basically, the only reason this monstrosity should be seen is that you: a) are a big fan of zombies and have to see all the zombies made or b.) You like to play MST3K, the home game. See him with friends and get ready for tons of unintentional laughter. <br /> <br />
