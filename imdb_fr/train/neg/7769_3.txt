A real guitar at the head of a Bill Rebane movie that seemed to have gotten worse in his job in the eighties. Three millionaires crackpot invite nine people to a distant hotel to participate in a final standing contest in which the last competitor will receive a million dollars provided he succeeds so far. A series of lame jokes is drawn on some of the guests while the others indulge in what most adults would do under the circumstances, namely being shot down at the hotel bar. Most scenes are simply an excuse to center the camera on various parts of the female body, including an opening number that is a cross between American Bandstand and geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there is a hesitation that whites can not dance, this scene drives the last nail of this coffin. Pay special attention to the nipple slip. It lasts about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at different plot twists and what he strikes becomes the inspiration for the next scene, which makes this disorder incoherent. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots keep complete control until they are not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes more than accessories. They died until they were not dead. Even the narrator at the end replies that he does not know what happened. I challenge anyone to reason where Rebane was heading to this one. The acting game is a theater of caliber minus dinner. Most actors have probably resumed their daily work at Stuckey's local. I give him some points for the scene where the yuppie opens the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull that is filling. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that! This collection Chilling Classics is becoming the scourge of me. Bane, understood! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
