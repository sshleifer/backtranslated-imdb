If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social comment about a woman who was a victim of violence and who defended herself. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson spills the plates of his assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilance. It essentially cancels the judicial system. The movie "The Accused" was much better because the victim uses the court system and wins. What does "descent" tell victims of aggression that they must resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? No!!!
