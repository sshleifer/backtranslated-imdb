Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself and stop producing. You can not under any circumstances look at it and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute movie with this idea, not a feature. I am so sorry to have rented this movie. I will never look at anything with the Spurlock name on it. It's completely garbage. Filmmakers like this one should be on youtube and never get a distribution deal. The film claims that US consumers and their purchases are responsible for the current depression related to purchases and purchases of products. Circulating money in the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
