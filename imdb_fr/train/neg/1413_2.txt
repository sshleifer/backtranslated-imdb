I like Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure it would have been a good movie if something had happened. Nothing does. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too much. After an hour of frustration, I went through the remaining 20 minutes. Atrocious. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked for a while - in search of a role he could play, as a cashier in a supermarket. He goes to the supermarket where she works. Nothing is happening. She decides to take him home and they go to Arby, Target, in a car wash. Nothing is happening. They talk about their life. Nothing is happening. Never. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I also do not get Bill Murray's "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers" movies. If you like these movies, you may like this. Many people find movies like this one whimsical, charming, or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialogue fascinating. A common feature in movies like this is having a long silence / silence after an actor delivers a line that is meant to be meaningful. We know that makes sense, because it takes two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a philistine. I do not understand. For me, these kinds of movies are neither funny nor charming nor stimulating. They are just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laugh. No suspense. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I go to the movies for. I can be bored for free. I see weird / quirky characters in real life. I go to Target, fast food and car washes. These elements do not make a movie, even if the stars do that kind of thing. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just love hearing about it, have fun. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can watch it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. A total snoozefest.
