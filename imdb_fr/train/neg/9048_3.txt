Originally broadcast as ABC movie of the week. Two innocent young students are taken to a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed to call and no one knows they are there. The following is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for its time) dark. No nudity and beatings were tame enough, but the general feeling of thinness wore one. The unrated version is even worse - nudity is plentiful, the violence is extreme and, in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying prisoner forced to undress while a lesbian keeper "uses" it. Yuck! There is nothing wrong with the exploitation movies, but this one is on the brink. You have the feeling that filmmakers like to see these poor women tortured and degraded - all of this is put forward as if you were supposed to enjoy it. The unnecessarily morose ending does not help anything. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because the acting is good - but it actually makes the movie harder to watch. A sick and fishy film. Not recommended.
