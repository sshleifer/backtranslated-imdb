If you want to watch the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the still monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener The Golem and the passengers of the Ghost Train, you can not compare it, it gives him a bad reputation , bad acting, bad script, etc. my favorite of all time, I am really speechless, I have nothing more to say, please, do not make the effort to look at something so stupid, please, understand
