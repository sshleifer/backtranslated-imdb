Not that I want to be mean, but this movie surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie, I thought ... uh ... what is this movie about? I do not get the animations at all. This film will probably only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film, a group of people came out. After the movie, a lot of people said, "Is that it?" Frankly, I can not believe this film was awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you plan to watch this movie, I strongly recommend you do not do it. You are going to regret it. I am not joking. You will find that you are simply wasting your time and money watching the movie.
