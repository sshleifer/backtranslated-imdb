I'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent !!! Yay !!! This program summed up how much Victoria Beckham was obsessed with prostitution and talking about her family to the media, in the name of self-promotion and the "Beckham brand brand." <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I still loved David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand resting on his back like a puppet? <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was on Manchester United's Beckham premature departure and now the same thing happened to Real Madrid. I hope Beckham will be able to live with the fact that, even if he earns maybe billions of pounds, he has sold his soul to the American Buck and will end his days as part of a team that will fight for a promotion of the One Division in England (no offense - but in baseball and basketball, there is - football, not at all!) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I move away from subject. It's been years since I've seen such a completely false performance from 'Posh' - this performance has only been exceeded during the latter's worthy performances on the red carpet, as a result of the Rebecca Loos's debacle, when she deserved David, she clung desperately to his arm to save the million pounds her marriage had become. <br /> <br /> This whole cascade of public relations was pathetic. Why can not she just go quietly, support her husband with the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep his head down? When did she become so self-conscious that she feels the move to America should be wrapped up in this huge fan price? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he kept a shine of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do while learning. <br /> <br /> One more thing, Victoria: you complain about being constantly harassed by the papers. Little advice - stop telling them about your fate, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America !!
