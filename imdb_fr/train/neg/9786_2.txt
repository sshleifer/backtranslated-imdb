OK, I bought this movie from my friend as a joke gift on his birthday at Woolworths, because the cover page contained sexual innuendo. <br /> <br /> But we decided to watch it anyway. Just for the sake of hilarity. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but it's one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> It started well, and we thought, "Ok, that could be OK." But after about 10 minutes, we were unfortunately wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious painter" became the most obvious character, the Scouser / Australian (I say that because he had an accent I can not say, who is the actor , was catastrophic. <br /> <br /> Then everything ended and by that time, we had all lost the will to live.The final of the paint ball. <br /> <br /> The only one thing that I liked about this plot is that they did not win, but rather boring, they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know that has nothing to do with that, but the name the team was given was horrible Critical Damage - I mean they could pick a more awesome name, like "The Destroyers of the Antichrist" or something like that. that's how the movie should be called anyway.
