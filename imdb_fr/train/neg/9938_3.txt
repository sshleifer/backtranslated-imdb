The Marxist controversy of Jean Luc Godard is as close to an unassailable film that you are likely to see of a filmmaker of international renown. A bit of political drama, boring and interminable, mixes with the realization of "Sympathy for the Devil", staging the Rolling Stones in studio. <br /> <br /> The development process of the song, of Mick Jagger playing a demo on the acoustic guitar, the choirs being recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it is worthwhile to rent this film just to see the piece with the Stones. Almost half of the film is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of the chapter stops, you can ignore all the bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones compose a song. <br /> <br /> When I had this on laserdisc, I valiantly tried to look at everything, but I do not see how we could get through. I finally gave up and just one chapter jumped my way to the Stones segments.
