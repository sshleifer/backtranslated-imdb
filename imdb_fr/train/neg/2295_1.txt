Useless and boring film with the charismatic Mercurio completely lost. Released for a minute on a Thursday in perhaps a local cinema and avoided by all the people of Sydney, except me and four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project apparently created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (although Polson has become a lame thriller director like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio never seems to have a guernsey outside of the rogue roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of the biggest Australian exports on the screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and movies like this are just a waste of talent and time.
