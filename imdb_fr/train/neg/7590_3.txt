Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of the prima donna Camilla and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently remind us of the similarities of the plot of Dumas' novel The Lady with Camellias, the film Camille with Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least , Verdi's opera, La Traviata. Beautiful ladies not too virtuous, excluded from society for one reason or another, loved, divided, gathered just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... why spoil Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful interpretation of LA in the 30s, an earthquake deus ex machina that easily kills the other woman and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there is no beautiful song?
