Let me start by saying that I had read several reviews before renting this movie and that I knew what to expect. Yet, I was surprised by the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of werewolf and I used to forgive a lot when watching a movie. Most of them have mediocre effects, mediocre acting and weak scenarios (at best, revisited from previous films). So far, with the possible exception of some of the latest movies in the "Howling" series, this is the worst of the lot. <br /> <br /> First of all, history. He has been quoted many times in the reviews of this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is very obvious that the author (s) had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters. As often happens when a horror movie is given to a writer who considers himself "above" this kind of fare, they have tried to give a new twist to the myth of the werewolf. That's fine, but a fan who does not fear horror and tries to do it usually tends to disregard the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing it. The plot looks like a parody of werewolf movies, and the events described sound so wrong that I felt my intelligence was seriously insulted. TV reports, for example, never move away from the reporter to get close to someone in the crowd behind him. Give characters and viewers the credit they need to spot the villain in the scene without flashing neon lights. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As far as effects are concerned, I have NEVER seen a less credible werewolf. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. with crepe hair. The beast they used was a lot like ... well, a guy in a cheap rubber suit with glued hair and really ugly animatronics. And, I know that many people have already criticized the CG, but my God, it was awful. A scene depicts a woman changing, and begins with an all-female version of the actress, naked but without nipples for some reason. My first thought was, "Hey, why is one of the characters in ReBoot becoming a werewolf with a silly look?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like to look for positive elements in a movie, and little. The cinematography was passable (the film was shot entirely digital, which is interesting) and some of the performances were not terrific. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the best-made homeless woman in the world and Kane Hodder as the bad title. Plus, the Yellow Power Ranger has grown and ... well, fuckin '. And if you are looking for skin, there are some pretty tasty examples. This puts an end to the male-pig segment of criticism. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a good movie about werewolves, try "One American Werewolf in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers", or even "The Werewolf". Wolfen "(although this one has more wolf than he was). If you are a complete lycanthrope, then take a look. If not, drop this one.
