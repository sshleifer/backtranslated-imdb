I saw this film in preview and I can not emphasize enough the seriousness of what I thought. From the beginning, the audience was moaning over the terrible southern accent of Pacino. Poor Al looked really, really haggard, and I can not decide if that was deliberately part of his role as a drug addict publicist, or maybe he had not slept before coming on the set. Much worse than Pacino's close-ups, however, it's the bad excuse for a plot. At the beginning of the film, we are told that the character of Pacino is gay, and I suppose that is what the scriptwriter had originally planned. Later, however, we are supposed to suspend our disbelief and believe that Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleepwalkers through lame roles) covet this elderly, effeminate, half-dead man with that ridiculous accent. The worst of all was the intriguing thread of the plot, which was about corporate espionage that is never explained in detail and that we never care about at all. Because it was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment, because of the possibility of re-turning and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a dime to see it in theaters.
