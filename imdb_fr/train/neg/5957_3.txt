An insignificant and misguided 1980s horror (haha!), As there are thirteen out of a dozen, but it may sound funny if you look at it in the right frame of mind. The special effects are sticky, the game of actors atrocious and the scenario seems to be missing a few essential paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typically American setting, where every teenager works in the same restaurant and the cool high school boy throws cherry bombs into the bathroom. It's here that a TV guru, Dr. Blake, and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for national control of the mind. Under the label of "independent thinkers", a gigantic and nerdy brain sends waves to television and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is it? Now it's up to the rebellious teen from Meadowvale to save the world! The funny thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that's about it. Meh, who needs an experience in a movie like this, really? Unfortunately, there is not much bloodshed and the "evil" brain looks like an oversized puppet. The only thing more or less interesting for horror lovers is to take a look at the cast and the team that made this film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who created "Bloody Birthday" and "Plague". These two films are much better and they have wisely decided to resign from the film industry. The most familiar face of the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, which horror fans will love for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity factor and she is obviously a great talent ?? She has exactly 3 films on her repertoire of which CECI is her "masterpiece". In her debut, she was credited with "fugitive model" and in "3 men and one baby", her character is described as "one of Jack's daughters". I really wonder how she feels compared to her acting career ??
