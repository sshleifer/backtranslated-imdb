I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are very bad movies, are considered by some "critics" as a big cinema, only because they are not American. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score of this movie and noticed that it was selected for some major festivals. Do not let that fool you! Ignore it, unless you like dazed movies like this and call it great art! The film contains a hilarious scene after another (a similar Italian film came to my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only annoying, like some strangely rented movies, but that they play almost like camps. I mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (I mean: soap opera level), the story does not have a surprise (it has already been done several times before, linking several scenarios: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAYING BY HEART, only a lot better), not a realistic character (some real lights along the way, notice the hilarious girl looking like a zombie), etc., etc. etc. As if that were not enough, the film is 135 min. (count it!) long, and in the end the director opens his box of sentimentality. After a film with a hilarious dialogue and scenes that made the audience laugh at the projection of so many incompetences, well ... It's an insult to the cinema, which receives only high ratings because 'it's about being in an' other 'language, in this Spanish case. The strange world we live in ... 3/10
