The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, who is part of Mengele's twin experiences. It consists mainly of a version of what happened in Auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of other survivors. The film obviously had good reviews. This is one of those subjects on which no one dares to express a contrary opinion. <br /> <br /> Me too, during a big part of the film, I let myself be carried away by the emotion that the filmmaker so obviously wanted to see the spectator. to focus on. One of the comments of users on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the question on a public forum) could find only the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, while a group of Jews are arguing with Kor in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgive "is even debated, but the Kor, isolated and surpassed in number "But at that moment, the sappy mine that the film had on my dormant emotional repertoire had dropped enough so that I could see clearly once more. After "strong will" Eva Kor has forgiven her "Nazi kidnappers", the film begins to delve into what forgiveness is all, at least from Kor's point of view. The film talks about following her, passing her public pardoning statement to the Nazis and entering a new territory. For me, it was the meat of the film, surrounded by inedible fat of his "act of forgiveness". Obviously, it was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On the verge of testing her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal the wounds of the past, she goes to the "promised land" to meet with the Arabs, to discuss with them the problems they are facing. confronted and see if the dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and is sown with many debates and discussions with Jews in the United States on his act of forgiving the Nazis, including one before a Jewish group. center in Chicago. From that moment on, anyone who does not have tears in their eyes, who can not see the screen, will have a hard time missing out on the obvious contradiction in his statements. <br /> <br /> First of all, you will immediately notice his body language, defensive. and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. His comments on his fear of kidnapping show how much he was wasting time, effort and money. Dr. Sami Advan (professor of education at Bethlehem University), rather upset, runs perfectly when he explains to Kor that his statement would rather fall asleep in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Debate at the Jewish Center in Chicago, where she is "grilled" about the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, as a result of those who continue to suffer the trauma of the acts. <br /> <br /> I will cut the hunt. At the end of the movie, I was hoping I did not choose to watch the movie. The film was of poor quality, not trying to deepen things on Auschwitz, except for the purely trivial, just enough for the holocaust to refresh in the memory of the viewer and cause a flood of tears. This showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary, was unable to engage in a fair discussion. His capacity for discussion was limited to reiterating his position on forgiveness (at best), total refusal to listen or to participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, is everyone so retarded today that he can not notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Citing another IMDb user, "I do not consider her forgiveness to be weak, quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve her soul of her grip, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go." Such would be the perfect definition of the profane for MAKING PEACE. <br /> <br /> I suppose that, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no place to question those who "went through more things than the human" . the mind can understand. "<br /> <br /> PS The dictionary should definitely be included in every list of books to buy that everyone continues to create.
