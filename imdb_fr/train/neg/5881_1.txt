Absolutely the most boring movie I ever spent my money on. It was a bad choice for all these big stars to lose their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character has been portrayed in a less than inspiring way. No actor talent shown - just read a part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth has proved ugly for a thankless role, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies she chooses to play, as well as all those big stars who have left me disappointed with the way they left their films. talents to be drowned in a feature that leaves a lot to be desired in the entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the public to anticipate a great performance in a film that suggests feeling a tension and a deep emotion. There was not a moment when the cast was able to represent an interpretation of that on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ---- whatever.
