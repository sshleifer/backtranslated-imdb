Looking at this film, I came up with a movie script, titled "Making 10 Pieces or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good and bad news. The good news is that we can have Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what is the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I guess we'll have to find someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hire him for a day. A film lasts an hour and a half. A work day lasts eight hours. I do not see any problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he will have to spend time getting into a character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we ask him to play a character who is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will still have to understand his motivation and all the rest. You're not saying we're asking him to play a famous actor who makes a low-budget movie, does he? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But hey, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I guess we also have to shoot the movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a hell of a mess. We better make money with that. Just in case, ask the character Morgan Freeman to connect Wal-Mart or Target or one of these stores, so that at least someone wants to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a second ... what is a small bodega with an express way "ten articles or less"? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I guess it's pretty weird. But we can not change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my scenario is very similar to reality, but it was the same for "10 elements or less". It's a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate seeing it happen. When you watch an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some kind of message. I think they may have tried the tired old message "Do not let anything hold you back" that was put to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 items or less," the only message I received was "Look! Look Morgan Freeman!"
