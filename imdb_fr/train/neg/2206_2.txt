A scientist on an island is deeply saddened by the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who would not? It is a bit difficult to face the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everyone is called "Paul" constantly. In addition, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savetheday-hero lacks some credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot girls who make you watch the screen while the shark Paul bites another to death. In fact, I find the bad B-movies quite amusing. But for my taste, the film would have been much better if it had been designed for less than $ 1,000. So it could have been fun.
