A really unpleasant movie. Although the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (in the event of a stomach upset), there is no other redemptive feature. As in many 70's movies, you feel like having to take a long shower and clean your skin. The characters are uniformly unpleasant and the plot makes no sense.
