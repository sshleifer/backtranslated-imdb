I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I had not seen in any film since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment. The game of all parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren, who was well. Kata Dob√≥ was pleasant to look at despite her ridiculous dress and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not at all smart, it's something that has been repeated a million times in different movies. The crooks were totally stereotyped and Lundgren's character had no depth. I did not really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately, it's not a decent action. Each trick of the plot is extremely predictable and the incredible amount of extravagant unrealism and comic characters began to annoy me very quickly. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to young children who want it. comic action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I guess the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in making this film)
