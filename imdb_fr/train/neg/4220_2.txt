A brief opinion but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs a complete loss of 90 minutes. At the end of the film, I did not know what had happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the girls from "Philadelphia") and a few people vaguely recognizable, but that makes no sense. If the story has just been lost in editing, I do not do it now but good God ... <br /> <br /> Put a DVD instead or go to bed and rest! > 2 out of 10 (for cameos and a Morris Minor car chase) <br /> <br />
