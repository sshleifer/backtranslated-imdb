Really one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. In fact, I never took the time to write one of these texts, but I felt compelled to do so after witnessing this affront to the cinema and I felt a little wronged to lose my time with such shit to be honest. There were so many parties that made me furious with their completely randomness and lack of meaning (for example, when does the police ever kill people with infectious diseases) When are the hospitals defeated for lack of Why did he spying on his wife wandering outside in her dressing gown while carrying a gun while she was rolling on the bed?). In addition, the characterization - as you would expect almost in such movies - was horrible (for example, the way the blond guy - I do not remember his name frickin and do not do any nonsense anyway - completely spilled I ran away to leave her) and ended up asking them to face terrible ends! The production was horribly disjointed and cinematography had no reason to write.
