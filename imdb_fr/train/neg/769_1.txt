The major disadvantage of this film is that it is impossible to believe that one of these characters would ever be in a Macbeth professional production. Hearing the soft voice of David Lansbury struggling with the famous speech "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow", it was impossible to believe that anyone would ever consider him for this role. So I kept thinking that he did not have the role because he was an ugly actor; not because a larger name was available. Then, when we see parts of the play in rehearsal, it's hard to believe that the director does not parody things with a meaningless and misguided parody of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and the directors who see the piece through their own screw. interpretations. Sometimes filmmakers are so eager to film their films (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works) that they are content with less. This seems to be such an example.
