Sorry, but every time I see a movie in which a woman is punching a man and the man is only shaking, the film loses all credibility. Thus, the new (female) Starbuck immediately corrupted the plot even before it takes off (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as a type of sensitive hero than the new generation Kattee Sackhoff - whose overactivity will probably now be considered "a compelling, exciting, groundbreaking, and revolutionary performance" by the politically correct new speech of the editors. head of today's journal; but it is actually an old tired image of a woman with a chip on the shoulder as big as a town house: the biggest clich√© on the screens today. Maybe I can give another shot to this series, but the human caricatures will not keep me tuned. As James Hilton regretted, "A story, please, give me a story."
