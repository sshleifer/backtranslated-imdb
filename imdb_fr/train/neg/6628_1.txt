If the scale becomes negative, I will be happier. See Sushmita Sen was nice and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director have ruined everything in this story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting and everything else distracted from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and dances have not torn your head, first of all. The film could have been shot twice at an hour and a quarter and be rather good, a bit like "Seven Samurai", but the director and the writer did not engage in this direction, even if the "townspeople" finally found their spine and want to help. This film fails on so many levels: editing, writing, angles of photography, style, lighting, scenario - name any aspect of this film - it was BAD - the food of the caterer was also bad. In 6 years of watching Indian movies (Bollywood), I have never seen anything so badly done.
