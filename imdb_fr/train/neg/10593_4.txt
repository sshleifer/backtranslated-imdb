Ed Wood's infamous "classic" "Plan 9 of Outer Space" contains an indignant extraterrestrial calling the human race, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!" I would say that piece A of this trial would probably be this film, a ridiculously ridiculous sci-fi film. <br /> <br /> The star of the action series Jean Claude Van Damme returns in the lead role of the original film, Luke, a former universal soldier who is now working to make very good universal soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to take over the role in the first two sequences, he was too small to do much when the fourth movie in the Universal Soldier series arrived. So, probably swearing all the way through, he kicks, groans and croaks through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You will find a lot of senseless violence, but I would advise you to have your brain brain checked at the door when you start looking at this thing. Otherwise, you may forget where you left off at the end of the process. <br /> <br /> Luke is called to act against several universal soldiers after a really REALLY nasty computer named Seth (which makes HAL look like Ghandi). turns every other universal soldier into a devilish and ruthless killer. Of course, that's what these things are programmed to do, but in this case, they kill their creators, not "the enemy", so that's a problem. <br /> <br /> I like the stupid logic of this movie. Logic who believes that a supercomputer would create a body as shameful as Michael Jai White in this movie. Logic that dictates that the creator of Seth is a blue-haired cyber-stereotypical geek who casts clich√©s more regularly than does Old Faithful. The logic of a culminating karate fight features two characters clashing against each other, though ten glass panes break in the space of three minutes of screen time. <br /> <br /> The film also features a girl in danger, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier, and a romance on which one leaned, I have to think that writers thought that nailed on a romance was actually a good thing. And when this movie ends, it ends. Not a minute after a gigantic explosion of similar final, the credits run. No epilogue, no where are they now, no last kiss, just an explosion, a hug, finished. Even the creators want to get out of this business as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a shot 9, US: TR is a ridiculous little action movie that could have fun during evenings Van Damme fans who like to see their heroes reach new depths. Do not be seen on a serious stomach.
