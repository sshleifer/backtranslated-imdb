I will not add anything to the plot review, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> Orphanage very improbable on Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> Well to spot the face, and I quote, "look at the mouth, it's Cassie de Fools and Horses". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was a lot better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Exchanger? It was free to watch the Horror channel before switching to the subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
