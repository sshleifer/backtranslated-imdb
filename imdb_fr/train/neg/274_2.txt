There seems to be little middle ground with regard to Watch On the Rhine. We love him a lot, applauding his sincerity, his liberal point of view and his acting, or we hate his obvious propaganda, his mediocre dialogue, his cardboard characters and his great tenderness. I fall a lot in the latter category and I find the film and the play - in terms of the activities of European refugees in Washington in wartime - overwhelming boredom, especially for acting, and even intermittently. This author, Lillian Hellman, was on the side of the angels is unimportant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she rarely explored ideas that the author and the public did not share yet, except to emphasize how "formidable the other side" is. Even when I find myself one hundred percent in agreement with what she has to say, as in the Rhine, I still can not stand the way she says it. Her characters are unreal and, while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people speak, she has no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I completely agree with Mary McCarthy's departure for the dismantling of Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think that the theater is dead or in extremis and aspire to the good old days, I invite you to take a look at Watch On the Rhine, as bad as Angels In America, which does not than show that the theater has only one foot. in the grave sixty years ago.
