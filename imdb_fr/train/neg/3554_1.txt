I rented it in the 80s and, honestly, I do not remember anything about the movie, but it's the worst film I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of those films "he was so gore, he leaves you with a bad feeling". It was not even one of those "what was that?" movies. I do not remember the performance of the actors, but the filming was mediocre, the story disjointed and the style definable. When it was over, I was sorry for wasting my time. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of movies that I did not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or stories, but it was clear that these films had some of these properties. The incubus does not have one. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have considered NOT commenting on this "play" for fear that someone will look at it out of curiosity, but I am obliged to warn all those who love them movies to skip this movie. .
