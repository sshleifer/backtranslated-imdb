I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but not me. It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Parker. The three actors do a remarkable job in this film about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and the infidelity of the third. Everything happens in a house by a lake and it's beautiful. The film first wants to treat its subject as a comedy, then as a drama, and I thought it had to be the opposite.
