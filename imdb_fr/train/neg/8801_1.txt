Pieced (edited) set of corpse parts (deleted scenes) from corpses (Anchorman), the Frankenstein monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something you'll never want to look at twice ... .. maybe even once about it.) <br /> <br /> Most often, the relativity of scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third-person narrator. What's even more disturbing is that the WURB characters are incompatible with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (the initial story tells that WURB is taking place shortly after the original ). At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown since the beginning of the movie and embraced to have a hybrid / lover co-anchor. In this film, he returned to his immature antics with phone calls of jokes to Veronica (these are clearly the most similar scenes to those of original Anchorman spliced ​​in WURB.) <br /> <br /> The part that makes A film, a story in perpetual evolution, staged a clan burglar without cause called Alarm Clock. These scenes are almost painful. This part has been removed from the original scripts for Anchorman. <br /> <br /> Most scenes involving our Channel 4 press team are clearly alternate / deleted scenes of Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original scene, to the same original group "quarreling about having a woman on the team" and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to make about news stories <br /> <br /> Burgundy re-creates their first rendezvous with the meeting place by car overlooking San Diego and a dinner in his favorite club, Tinos None of the characters mention that they have already gone at the rendezvous, and when Burgundy enters Veronica with Tinos, he presents it to him as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as on their original date. <br /> <br /> I still have to thank the filmmakers, even though WURB is nothing more than a clever way to present deleted scenes. tied together with the narration. Between the two stories of Ron Burgundy, it's the weakest. Looking back, it's quite a feat for Anchorman to be out of the ashes of WURB. You stay in class, IMDb. Thank you for being here.
