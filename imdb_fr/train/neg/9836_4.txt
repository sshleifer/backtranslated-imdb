John Scott (John Wayne) and his partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are rowing friends at the Rattlesnake Gulch Rodeo. Scott is a fairly honest competitor, but finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty-five cents on a dollar in prizes from a crooked promoter, he will have to collect his winnings under the threat of firearms. Coincidentally, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they would like the rest of the rodeo to take over; they shoot at the promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall) and give the impression that Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a flowing gag in the film where they are about to fight for different banalities. Every time Chandler takes a wild run, Wayne's foot tramples and makes him stupid. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, there is a beautiful advertisement for Lipton's Tea in one of the scenes where Scott's love interests Anne (Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the friends are again supervised during a robbery on stage. Having changed his mind and seeing the mistake of his behavior, the mean Jim wants to be honest and confess to the sheriff, but Pete overthrows him. While being treated, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne is in the middle of a fight between good and bad to face the sheriff. <br /> <br /> "The Desert Trail" is one of the John Wayne Westerns blander of Lone Star Productions at this time. George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt are obviously absent, we usually see one or both. If you're a fan of John Wayne, you'll have to see it once, but it'll probably be enough.
