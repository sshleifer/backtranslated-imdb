Honestly, I was surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so terrible that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few errant and dead stereotypes. The extent of the character's development gave each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes have just begun, coming from nowhere with a breathtaking techno track. As I watched this movie, I kept asking, "Where is this going?" What's going on? The acting was high-school theatrical, with a rigid wooden cast, as if the actors were reading memory cards without understanding their lines. Their difficulty in providing lines has been made even more obvious by the horrible sound design. ADR appeared to have been recorded in an open room. The actors constantly took care to score their goals, seeming almost robotic in their movements. Thus, these apathetic automatons go through a series of unlikely and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transitional scenes. They were there, now they are there. This was happening now. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Not really worth nine dollars though.
