This film really shows his age. The impression I saw was terrible because of age, but there may be better impressions. However, it was not the major problem of the film. The problem was that, although the film was shot in 1933, it was essentially a silent film, in which the smallest of the dialogues was scattered (only a few sentences) in the most amateurish way. Sometimes the characters had their backs turned or spoke with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "hide" (?) Hide the fact that the film had been dubbed. It's true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed in many languages, but doing it this way was really stupid and obvious. It looked cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looked like a small budget and an idiot. It's really a shame though, because there was a grain of good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to go through this archaic mess. Even with some glimpses of Hedy Lamarr being nude (and somewhat chunky), this is not worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even in 1933, this film was a misfire. The only interesting thing about the movie is to see how Lamarr was different in 1933 from the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America - she looks like two completely different people. <br /> <br /> Incomplete film and technically inferior, I do not see how he got such rave reviews. For technical problems alone, the film can not rate a 10 or anything near it.
