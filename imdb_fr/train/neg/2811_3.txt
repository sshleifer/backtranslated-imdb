Will one day make films without nudity and without sex? This happened at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God, my son was outside or I would have been panicked if he had seen the soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies not care about those they offend or corrupt? The children could have looked after the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys, but you should expect it in a Western movie. Randy Travis was really good in his role. If writers, directors and producers stopped playing so many sex scenes. What must happen to stop them from leaving in this direction? Where can I complain?
