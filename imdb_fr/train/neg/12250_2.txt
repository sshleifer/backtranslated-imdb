Looking at Crocodile, the pearl of Tobe Hooper, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the niche crocodile / college crocodile exploitation / monster. I look forward to a misplaced producer who will make several sequels to these delicious candies from the goodness of the camp. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of talent and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkeys creating special crocodile effects on a computer, all we would need is a crocodile forage cast with Russ Meyer's breasts and Ren Hoek's chest implants. <br /> <br /> While Tobe Hooper's grumpy opus was referring to his own films, Blood Surf chose to broadcast a series of aging-related themes in the bucket of other films. See if you can look beyond Revenge of the Nerds series of suites for hints / tributes? / Scams at Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones Crusade, Convent, Godzilla 2000 and other James Bond movies. Also, try to find the fade for television where the editor has given up making sense of the title. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the pot could not try his tenor sotto voce with a monologue on environmentalism ... or a sneaky appreciation, but the near-captain Ahab of history is makes talk about his tour de force. Perhaps, in the years to come, we will see a pot galloping after a shootout in a golden sunset. Or, hopefully, a monkey will throw a glass of water in the toilets of an international space station for the dwarves and enjoy the waltz-exploiting blood monkey / midget / crocodile zero-g. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, The absence of a whammy bar in surf music irritated me.
