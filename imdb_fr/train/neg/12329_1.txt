At the time I was a bailiff, "Private Lessons" was played in the 4-plex where I worked. It was a sleep that was sold on Fridays and Saturdays for several weeks. I never had time to see it but I saw it was on cable last weekend, so I decided to try it. What I saw during the next 90 minutes is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that made me feel uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The basic story is a teenager who is crazy about his sexy wife (Sylvia Kristel). She too seems to feel an attraction for the boy, but for more sinister reasons. So we see scenes of the boy watching her undress and invite him to look at him. And that goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Her "scary" reactions every time Sylvia takes off a garment or when she touches it are horrible. I did not laugh once during this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And let's not start with the subplots of the housekeeper and the driver planning to extort money from the child. Let's just say it involves pretending to die, burying a body ... I could go on and on and on, but it's getting more and more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Even though Eric Brown was older than his age, he looked like a baby. It seems he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if THIS was acting, I should perhaps rethink my criticisms of Brown) and it was too close to the border to be erotic. I have never been so disgusted by a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is very beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I must mention the last scene. For me, it's just sick, but I remember that the audience applauded when the freeze film was framed and dissolved in the credits. Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the teachers. He invites her to dinner and she looks at him as if Tom Cruise had just invited him. She nodded and he walked away, smiling triumphantly at the camera. LEAVE ME ALONE! Yes, I'm sure teachers around the world would risk everything for a teenager in appearance. <br /> <br /> I'll never understand the attraction this movie had in 1982. It was definitely more than nudity, because there are teenage sex comedies with nudity that bombed in the box- office. And to say that these same teenagers who applauded this film 22 years ago are climbing the ladder of the company and can possibly contribute to the management of this country. It's a scary thought.
