This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was left for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s that spoke, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It was not an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry over the next few decades could have gone back to that episode if it had done it right. In fact, the modernization of sex bots is the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to movies or TV when this episode was shot. They could have at least seen her act as such. . His flesh would then have added a scary element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful little love story about two humans on a distant star. <br /> <br /> The twilight zone has always stretched imagination and credulity. Normally, nobody cared. But this episode seemed paralyzed by a Calvinist morality avoiding what would have been masturbation with a machine or outright negligence.
