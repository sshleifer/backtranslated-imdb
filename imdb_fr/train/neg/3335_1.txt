This Cannon film tale is the worst of all and proves that a five-minute fable does not make a feature film. Poor Sid Caesar, as a vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it is hard to look at him. As a clever tailor, Robert Morse does not have an ounce of charm. His unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter). The "songs" are awful and only slow down what's in the plot. The direction is practically nonexistent and the secondary characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is pretty as the daughter of the emperor, but her voice has obviously been doubled for some reason, a destiny shared by many minor actors. And the film crawls with turtle steps. Hans Christian Andersen must have been doing tricks in the tomb when it happened. In all honesty, at least in this film, it is not surprising that he passed directly to the oblivion of the video.
