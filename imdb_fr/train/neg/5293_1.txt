I picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story looked good and there was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how horrible his game is, he walks and talks so stupid all the time, it's wrong and not convincing. It does not stop there, almost ALL characters play so badly that it's ridiculous, the only acceptable game was that of Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide very early and we do not see him anymore, we do not even know why he did it! Everything in this film screams of poor quality, I can not believe how such a thing came out! I have been repeatedly tempted to stop looking. In fact, halfway through, I decided to stop watching and turn off the thing, I went to the BDIM to check what others thought about it, I found zero comment (not surprised), so I decided to force myself to manage the pain and go back to finish it and then come here to comment. The only good thing to do (for me) was the theme of the high school rock band, the occasional guitar game and singing parties, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad actor and director ... Terrible movie.
