Looking at this again recently, I found it very comforting to see how they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the tight budget and demanding actors meant an inevitable failure. In any case, it was a disaster, but I imagined how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if we realized one sincerely - and with the money needed to employ the most talented artists and writers. talented. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, it will not be possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I feel that, even with a budget of some kind, this story just can not be stuffed. up. Fantasy offers so many opportunities to make an interesting movie. There were many moments in this movie that were potentially more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did it, although of course you still have to use your imagination because of poor performance. The way they tried to show the spectral world from Frodo's point of view, for example. Or how Galadriel showed Sam what was happening at his place for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really appreciated in this version - the moments of silence. There were times when dialogue was spoken without background music against a fall back. Compare that to the grandiose camera of Jackson's films and the intrusive score that seemed designed to emphasize how each scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we have ever watched. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, they were quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and his friend cost more than $ 270 million in production costs, including at least $ 90 million more for marketing. , massive tax relief from the New Zealand government and significant savings from filming in New Zealand and not in the United States. However, despite marketing claims, the intention to remain faithful has never been there. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said in an interview, saying she had not deliberately read the books before writing the script. Jackson also said that they originally intended to make a fantasy film "in the style of" the Lord of the Rings, and that the one he really wanted to do was "The Return of the King" because he had a lot of battles, but no character development. . <br /> <br /> However, this film has tried to be more true. Of course, a lot of things were wrong, the acting was awful and had almost everything gone, and the pace was too fast. Naturally, they cut a lot and adapted other scenes, and for that they deserve credit. While Jackson added many action scenes that were of no use to the screenplay, Bakshi made book scenes that did nothing to advance the storyline. There is in fact a curious resemblance between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films at the beginning - in the sense that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - though some of these things may be coincidental. <br /> <br /> It was not a good movie, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview with AV Onion that only animation could do justice to the lord of the rings. His version did not work, but he may have been right.
