Many promises and nothing more. An actor of choice by HK standards, but man oh man is this one stinky. No story? It does not matter, the action will compensate like most action movies of HK. What? The action is terrible, old and sparse? So far, Dragon Dynasty releases are generally superb and generally considered as classics of Asian cinema. It's a scourge. They managed to argue with some Infernal Affairs actors, but they can not bring an incoherent scenario to life. There are dialogue scenes where two or three lines are pronounced with a break between each and no continuity in what the characters say. You almost have the impression that they each give a monologue in class and ignore the other characters. Michael Biehn is in wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a double? No way. Yes way. Stay away.
