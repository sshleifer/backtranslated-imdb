I was so impatient to see this when he was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest problem. Far from the whimsical world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and unpleasant. I do not think Dr. Seuss would have approved it. The Grinch flight was much better for Christmas. I understand that this book contained subtle jokes for adults, but my children have not figured it out yet. While The Cat in the Hat cried out vulgarity, they captured much more than I would have liked. Growing up with Dr. Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got to the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton I hope he will do Mr. Seuss justice.
