Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the murderer breaks a glass of vodka next to her, to make her feel like she's been drinking. But just before she was killed, her sister's partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she has not been drinking alcohol for 4 days. Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And, the characters talk about her bleeding when she fell down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this film, which is rather horrible overall. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the large distribution. Some flaws: the writing is not very good, the music is made for television, and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene of the film.
