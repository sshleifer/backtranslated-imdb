I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and I got this action drama too sentimental and super cheap at a budget that gives Kickboxer the look of Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam, and by the time Lou saves Reb, he is shot in the head, which is easily one of the worst effects of all time. The scenes of Vietnam are shot in someone's yard, I swear! Lou is now brain injured and Reb and he live together and have a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage against money and Reb launches into a killing to get him back. There is no good fighting scene, the punches are two inches from a person. Character personalities change in seconds. A guy is a bad guy and in the next scene he's good. The acting is horrible and the music is a song to Frank Stallone's too sentimental sound that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
