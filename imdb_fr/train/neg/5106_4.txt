ALIEN LOVE (as this film is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I do not mean it's an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it's a TVM with swear words, sex, very good T & A, a bad scenario and a very retro atmosphere. You can imagine someone like John Hughes directing this film ten years ago, although of course he would have eliminated the T & A. <br /> <br /> To get back to the bad scenario, one of the problems is that few characters have any kind of motivation especially Amanda. Why does she come looking for Connie at the bar? Just so she can meet an alien? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films from the mid-1980s had this type of plot, most of them being more defined and convincing than those presented here. The scenario continues to follow an ill-defined, unconvincing and illogical path. <br /> <br /> That said, I found ALIEN LOVE observable and not just below the display stand. As a science fiction sex comedy, it's way better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE Easy.
