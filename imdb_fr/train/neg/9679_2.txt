This film was horrible in the worst case: you do not care. You make fun of what happened in the plot; you make fun of the characters. Everyone was heartless. I ended up walking about 45 minutes because I just did not want to put my mind on it anymore. There is way too much sex in the movie. Sex can be good; he can even make the film (hence Karma Sutra) but sex here was neither beautiful nor sexy. It was just ugly. Do not see this movie.
