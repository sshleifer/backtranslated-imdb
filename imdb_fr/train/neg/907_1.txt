I wrote a review of this movie after buying it on DVD and being deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to see him again after reading some of the comments since. As a film student and myself making films with a similar budget (that is, without a budget, filmed in digi cam), I maintain my original comments. This is a student project without budget (and not particularly good), released on video / dvd to look like an award-winning movie (if you read the cover). So, persuade the public to think that it is something that it is not. I want to get my money back under the Trade Description Act! Complete garbage!
