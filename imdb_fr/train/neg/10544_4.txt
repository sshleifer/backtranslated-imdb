When the memory of your childhood told you it was a scary movie; it's touching and going if you should come back. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene featuring a homeless and naughty villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, it's sad to say. It is full of clich√©s of cops and a very poor scenario with holes that a truck could cross (with innumerable "twists" practices that can advance the story). Lou Diamond Phillips is the hyper-confident policeman who sends the serial killer Kober into the gas chamber to discover that he was a Satan's minion himself and now has the power of resurrection and the power to possess any weak person. mind that he comes across. In the mix, a very poorly realized psychic that helps to solve the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, that's bullshit. But nice as such, especially if you keep good memories. It scared me like a kid and this scene with the homeless person is still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; forget about that, just about every scenario is presented and you end up with a cross between an action movie by Steven Segal and a demonic movie from the '70s. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to place Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here? Needless to say, it is not at all convincing, but it does its best and I have never had the problem with the type that a lot of critics here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less we say better. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; always liked this actor. <br /> <br /> "The first power" is perhaps what the doctor has prescribed after a hard day's work and a "brain stop" is needed. The beer will probably improve the visual experience and I will certainly have a lot of it the next time I make this movie. In all; This is not a good movie but a bit of a culprit for nostalgic fans who were easily scared when they were kids. "See you soon, buddy!"
