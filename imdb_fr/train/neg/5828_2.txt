I totally agree with another speaker who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be totally boring and uninspired "regarding the content". It can produce candy for the eyes (and I like sweets), but its claim and its basic artistic void only diminish any joy. <br /> <br /> I fear that many people do not distinguish between Jodorowsky's similar (but only superficial) works and even more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and bored through the final scenes ...) This kind of art as Mr.Barney does adds to the confusion and dissuades viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Conceptual "art" vacuum typical post-modern. And check his interviews. I do not buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I never bored to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a real disappointment. Especially if it offered the possibility of being something, to actually say something in a non-orthodox non-linear way (like the beginning and the big choreographed dance and the preparations for the release of the ship. the sea ... Faecal ideas as a valuable object (if they were excrement) These "pearl" divers ... Anything could build a great surrealist film with content. was not the case, and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing and fake ceremony tea ... How many things are vain, false and philosophically pretentious but empty? <br /> <br /> I have some superb Scenic scenes, but all the film has become so boring and pretentious, totally empty and fake, which made me physically sick. <br /> <br /> And as time does not have a good tempo, I like slow-motion movies, but it was boring in some scenes - pa it was pretentious and false, so I was forced to stay as a witness to extended scenes of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> This kind of movies kills art and the spirit t My opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
