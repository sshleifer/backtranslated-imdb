This film reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another art-work film presenting a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remember "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where many disadvantaged characters live in a camp at the seaside in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their will and with all the confrontation of characters who do not correspond. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of naturalism. I did not like the film and I do not like the people who participate. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a member of a great joke, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: hell is on this world.
