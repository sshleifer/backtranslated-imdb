If I could give less than 1 I would do it. Do not bother to rent; if someone gives you the DVD, burn it. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie. A total waste of "film" even digital. I saw better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys. Lommel claims to have written this, if so, it is a classic case of illiteracy in two languages. The story is non-existent, the dialogue is mainly screaming, the camera work is a kind of attempt at artistic flair with an absurd cut of completely unrelated leaps from industrial transport scenes or some sort of strange angry woman rift. I can usually follow an unseen plot or see the goal in a "creative" movie - I love David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This far exceeds my limited understanding abilities that I missed or it's totally useless. I think this is a "let's see if we can grab a title that will come out soon and make a strange flaw on it and see if we can grab some of the money" scam ". <br /> <br /> I can not see why Lionsgate even bothered with that, totally worthless, it's such a shame that I will not praise any other of this same director.
