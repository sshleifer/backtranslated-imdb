Towards the end of the film, I thought it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom and looking at how our navy was rescuing at sea. I liked seeing the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have understood that before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable paintings with very little security is strange and unrealistic. The acting was pretty good, because they are mostly seasoned professionals, but if you go too far from what might happen, it should look more like a fantasy, a comic, and so on. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film was pilot Felix Ungar, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The film was filled with well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for the drama, but it hurts the quality of a film when a serious subject becomes a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about plane travel is that everyone moves casually. They walk around with drinks, depositing them and picking them up 5 minutes later, as if they were in a building or something, and acting as if the turbulence simply did not exist. Plus, I know it's a disaster movie, but the suspense should not include a 30-second crash after hitting something. Anyway, skilled actors and actresses prevent this weak scenario from being turned into a film that was boxed after its first screening. I love Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person dress up ... :)
