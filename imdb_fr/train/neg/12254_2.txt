Some might make fun, but there is a real art of making particularly bad movies. This is missing on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A group of young people - women with erect breasts and permanently wet t-shirts - naturally go to the movie "surfing the blood" and end up in a crocodile foot. <br /> <br /> Not only was the crocodile obviously fake, but some props [note that the boat hits the reef in particular] give the impression that they came out of Thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Not good, from start to finish. Do not see it!
