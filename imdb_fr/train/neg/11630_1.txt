>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>> >>>>>>> >>>>>>> With their flawless baroque, cruel offensive humor, safe enough to offend anyone, you will surely think it would be a riot of laughter! ............false. The worst movie since Open water. Do not be surprised if you completely miss this movie on the release date because I'm not convinced that it will not succeed at all at the box office. This movie had a lot of potential but became too short. Not enough character development, clumsy actors and the advantage of this film was nudity. Breasts. Unbelievable. If I had to see this movie again, I would become POSTALE myself. <<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<< <<<<<<<
