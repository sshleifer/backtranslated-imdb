1 in 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can not believe you've lost 2 hours of your life while you see the generic role. Honestly, I think I could make a better movie about Vampire ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that does not just suck (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a little cool, has mystery and gives a little kick.
