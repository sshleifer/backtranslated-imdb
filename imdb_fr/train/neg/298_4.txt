Daraar got off to a good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Otherwise, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. The first half of the film is dedicated to Rishi Kapoor, who fell in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he's a little old for her ??? <br /> <br /> Things are starting to get worse in the middle of the movie when Juhi talks about her previous husband; and wow what a fool he is! It was a hyper-protective monster with a HIGH TEMPERATURE! He used to hit poor Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons I really do not like this movie is that I can not stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) being so abused. This movie in general has MUCH too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so disgusting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is that if you're thinking of renting Daraar, you should immediately put it back on the shelf where you found it and choose something else!
