This word "True" in the title of this movie made me wake up. They sounded louder when a title card called America's civil war a "war between states" (the favorite circumlocution of hardened southerners). Jesse James - thief, slave and murderer - is described as a calm and kind farm boy. <br /> <br /> How dishonest is this film? There is NO mention of slavery, let alone the fact that Vesse James' poor mother had slaves before the war and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this film, all these civil war soldiers were really fighting over whether Missouri was a northern or southern state ... it's ALL. (Missouri: It's a mint candy! It's a breath of mint!) Blacks are totally absent from this film, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of which bears the "HELP THE POOR" sign which is very improbably typed instead of manuscript. (Some nineteenth-century newspaper clich√©s are also inaccurate, with twentieth-century fonts.) <br /> <br /> This movie has a weird back-and-forth structure. There are very impressive stunts (and good stunt work) and excellent editing. I enjoyed a line of dialogue: "Some of these boys will never taste beans again." The film sums up a few facts: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, hides her right arm in scenes following the Pinkerton agents raid (here called "Remington") in which Jesse James' mother was injured and had to be amputated. from his lower arm. Some mistakes here are forgivable: during his days in the bush, the real Jesse James has accidentally shot some of his middle left, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) has no stumpfinger. I saw a picture of Jesse James' real wife; Jesse James might have been more at home if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of revisionism here and most male actors wear 1950's hairstyles. But many of the mistakes in this film were preventable. Jesse James' mentor, William Quantrill, is mentioned several times, but not all actors pronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into a two-story complex house (where he will soon die) after paying $ 18 rent. In fact, Jesse James' last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting $ 14. There was no upper floor ... so when Jesse James was killed, his wife could no longer run upstairs, unlike Hope Lange. (She was actually in the kitchen.) <br /> <br /> A mistake of continuity: Robert Wagner (without stuntman) does an awesome job taking a slug to the jaw and falling while his hands are tied behind his. back ... but when he gets up, the rope that ties his wrists is gone. <br /> <br /> The scenario juggles with strange and useless dates. After the flight attempt to Northfield, Jesse says he expects to return home before his birthday. The raid on the Northfield Bank by James Gang (September 7, 1876) took place two days AFTER the birthday of Jesse James. (Maybe he was talking about next year's birthday.) Later, we'll see Jesse and his wife moving into their home in St Joseph on a sunny summer day, while Jesse will tell him what he's going to do. Do not worry about Christmas Eve ... but in real life, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse James moved into this house on December 24, 1881 ... so this scene should be * BE * on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely preventable. <br /> <br /> Some of the fictions made here do not make sense. According to this film, the raid on the Northfield bank failed because a (fictional) henchman was slow to cut the wires of the telegraph. If that had really happened, it would have actually hindered the escape of the James Gang ... but it would not have affected the flight itself, which failed for other reasons. <br /> <br /> There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (under the name of Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (under the name of Cole Younger) and by the actress Marian Seldes in a rare role on the screen. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, a generally underrated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner proved his impressive reach by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he can not decide whether to represent Jesse James as a goodie or a bad guy ... so he does not bother much. John Carradine telephones in his role in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptizes Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in his childhood by his uncle, a Methodist pastor ... but perhaps this second baptism is a complement. <br /> <br /> Jesse James was not Robin Hood. (I doubt Robin Hood is Robin Hood either, but that's another story.) There is not one documented case of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone other than his own family. After a few delays, he did not even share the spoils with the rest of his gang. In this film, Jesse is shot just after promising to give up his bandit habits forever. In fact, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a burglary at the Platte City bank. As a preparation for most of his flights, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor people who (in the wrong legend) would have been the beneficiaries of his largesse. I fell in love with a scene in which the fictional character Jesse James is so refined that he disapproves of an oil painting that neatly depicts nudes. <br /> <br /> 'The real (not much!) Story of Jesse James is deliberately dishonest about a murderous thief and also dishonest about civil war. For the very impressive waterfall work, a good editing and a few action shots, I will give 2 out of 10 points to this dishonest film.
