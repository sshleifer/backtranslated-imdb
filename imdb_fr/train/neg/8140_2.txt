I saw this movie on the mystery science theater when it was called "He lives by night". This title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, he would be more exactly Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies bats, I think, because he wants to improve the treatment of rabies. It's not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife go around a cave and he is bitten by a bat. Why a scientist must take a ride to study bats exceeds me. Should not he be able to go alone? After being bitten, he and his wife go on honeymoon where he begins to have seizures. They go to the worst doctor. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3 or 4 people and his wife supports him and you're supposed to support him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
