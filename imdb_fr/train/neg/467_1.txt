There are bad movies, terrible movies, even boring movies ... I can watch most movies and edit them until the end, not this time. Avoid it like the plague, the annoying music, the terrible editing, no comedy, it's more sticky than a mug of novelty ... My wife wanted to look as if it was Legally Blonde material or something comparable to watch, but never better than average, chick flick. This is the first time she begs me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, they were not great to start with (Denise did a good job in Starship Troopers and Wild things), but the gravel. I feel like a cup after spending 30 minutes on it ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after many face building work. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells. grumbling at the total ax that's on your screen.
