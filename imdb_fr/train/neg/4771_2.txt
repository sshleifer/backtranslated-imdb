Do not waste your time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the most lamentable I've ever seen. I'm seriously wondering how the people involved in making this film could have watched this final scene and say, "Yeah, now there's an end!" and patted themselves on the back. For me, it seemed to me rather that they lacked ideas! They built the final scenes for a cool twist, but instead, just let the entire installation fall flat on his face. When the last shot went dark and I heard the generic music start, I was shocked - I could not believe what I was seeing and someone might even call it an end. The best thing to do with this movie is to rewrite the ending and give it a substance. Seriously, I would really like anyone who invented this movie in a room to look at it and say - WTF ?? !!!!
