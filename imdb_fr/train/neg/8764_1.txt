This film was an absolute torture. First of all, it's a huge 4 hours! Admittedly, the Kargil war may have had several points captured and for which we fought, but each of these battles does not need to be shown. So maybe it's a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertised. Of course, this did not seem to be the case, as there were not enough backgrounds and some flaws. The fight sequences have been so badly executed. I am terribly disappointed by the man who gave Border well done sequences. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This could be a spoiler.) The whole army is walking uphill, about five soldiers are cursing five thousand times each (they also use the same keyword each time), one of the main actors is killed, someone shouts for a stretcher says, "No, do not take a stretcher, it will take six men from the battalion," then an actor dies. The same thing happens again and again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the film is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most tiny roles. They are all dressed and described as being the same. Two of them were crying synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and their head exactly at the same time, then bit their dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list is only getting longer. I know I'm forgetting something again. In any case, I think I have sufficiently criticized the film for you to get the image.
