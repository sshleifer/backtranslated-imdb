I saw this on DVD (it's called CORRUPT in this format) and the presentation text on the case really told how much the character of Harvey Keitel, Frank, looks so much like the one he played with BAD LIEUTENANT in "This powerful and hard policeman thriller". What the camera did not mention is that it is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music that he does not put on the CD player, he pulls out a big plastic pancake, puts it on a kind of rotating hot plate where a kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake thing , which allows the music to be heard. You see what I mean is that it's an old movie? The case of the DVD did not give any idea that it was a film made 20 years ago. It is also a film whose production values ​​are mediocre, like many other Italian films posing as American films. With the exception of Keitel, the actors are awful although the performance of Johnny Rotten is stranger than weird, the cinematography is static, the quality of the image and sound gives the impression that I watched a copy of fourth-generation hacker (I do not know if it's a dodgy DVD or if it's a very bad movie) and the worst of all is Ennio Morricone's score. It is impossible to believe that the man who made the irritating intrusive incidental music of CORRUPT is the same one who made the music of these Clint Eastwood westerns. <br /> <br /> All this is a shame because CORRUPT has its moments. This is certainly not the greatest psycho thriller ever, but it caught my interest and as always, Keitel performs well as a violent policeman. Too bad the rest of the film does not live up to its requirements
