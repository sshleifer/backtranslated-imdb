I just bought the VHS tape for two dollars, I wasted my money! Hey, I'm digging Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third quality production is a rehearsal of a dozen other biker movies; A bunch of crazy biker psychos enter a hideous city, hit everyone and everything, and are defeated in this man by a dashing hero. Adam West sees the role as a hero, but he misses the cloak and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and frightened throughout the show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once she was saved from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a motley group, and we know they have already acted or at least should not have. Hell Riders, it's hell to watch!
