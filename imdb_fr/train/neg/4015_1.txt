a friend told me that it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in the porn industry. Even more terrible is that it is almost always on the screen. But I read somewhere that, at that time, porn had to have an "artistic" value. I could not find it though. See it only if you are interested in the history of public porn development or if you can enjoy art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.
