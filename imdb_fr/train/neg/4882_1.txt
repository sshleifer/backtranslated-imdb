There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are pretty fun. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those films. So bad that it was nice and it was worth revisiting. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst movies of my life, it says a lot because I'm not the type of person to say that nothing is worse. But believe me, it was absolutely horrible and running for an hour is an hour too much. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather incoherent story, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is fat woman running to kill people because she is not Fed. Well, you do not see it in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences of the first one. The new story could have been really funny with Ethel sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone, but nothing happens before the last 20 minutes of the movie and at this point, you are already falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera in this film is simply atrocious. It literally reminds me of something I had shot with my friends at the age of 15. The sound quality is different because you can not understand a word that most characters say. To give an example of the seriousness of the situation, go to a New York subway and try to understand what is being said through the speakers. That's what this movie looks like. Be that as it may, the actors are about as dry as a piece of dead wood. <br /> <br /> Now, I know that saying that this is the worst movie that exists is hard enough, but the words can not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
