I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I was not a massochist, I do not know if I would have survived the visualization. It seems like it costs about $ 1,000, but it's not the money that made them fall. The acting was awful - not just bad, the 3rd grade could have read the lines better. Secondly, the skin is the only other reason to watch this kind of film, which is sorely lacking in this movie. We do not even see the most attractive chicas of the buff. <br /> <br /> Ahh well, better luck next time huh?
