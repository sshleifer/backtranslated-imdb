1987's "Deathrow Gameshow" by Mark Pirro is an extremely old-fashioned, but sometimes very funny, black comedy. This film could have been much better, the acting is awful and some extremely lame scenes make it difficult to watch from time to time, but the concept is fun, and there are hilarious moments. In the near future (1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a TV show called "Live Or Die" in which convicted death row inmates have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money. Unsuccessful candidates are shot on the air using different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other stranger performance devices, followed by applause from the public in the studio. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made a lot of enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly corny and crappy in many ways. is undoubtedly fun in many areas, especially if you are a fan of black humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it's really funny and it's a good waste of time. 4/10
