There is only one word for this film. Terrible. The director clearly has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws everything. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray, he does not need to use it. Cray has a vision of British youth: to be attracted by the small crime and then sink into depravity. Like British newspapers, this film depicts young people with no aspirations or respect. Cray calls attention, but deserves none. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to put in front of the public. It assumes that the public ignores the atrocities of the world. Like an obscene graffiti on the wall of a toilet, he shows us male depravity with joy in adolescence. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have minor roles in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make a brief appearance. The game of actors is also amateur, young men Joe and Ben cringe. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is scary. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the seductive wife of famous chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to submit to such a test is incredible. The film is never subtle and Monica is the victim of the most gratuitous violence that is interrupted by a war action. War images are used to convey the idea that young men can not help themselves, that acts of violence will occur even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and symptomatic of our altered society where men occupy a position less and less important, but Cray descends to the level of barbaric men he seeks to expose using such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or, in the case of Manville, a decimated mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first film. I listened to what he had to say during a question and answer session at Edinburugh. He is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film reveals his naivety. The film should come out later this year, but I hope the company will go bankrupt because the public does not really need this kind of wasted material.
