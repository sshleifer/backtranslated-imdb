I did not like this movie very much. It was not really funny and in some cases it was downright stupid. Rob Schneider is really an extremely talented individual and although his role is satisfying, it seemed like a real mess for him to play. I mean, some parts were good and some humorous, but that's all. about that. The only thing that caught my attention during all this joke was that there were very beautiful women present and I'm not one to watch a movie just because of that, but that where even the slightest case of redemption could be found. Overall, it was a few notches below an average movie! <br /> <br /> Last question: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I'm delighted not to have wasted too much money on this. <Br /> <br /> Purchase DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Location: If you have a sense of prehistoric humor, then why not.
