My girlfriend and I were stunned by the seriousness of this movie. After 15 minutes, we would have asked that we quit smoking, except that we were too curious to see if the film could eventually be redeemed. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the praise given to this movie. The writing was downright awful and performed by some of the worst actors I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly bothered me about this movie is that people often talk to each other there. was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of embarrassment (as in Happiness). It was not that kind of break - it was just bad direction. This film could actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best for this film, because then the innate dialogue and the bad game would not be so noticeable. <br /> <br /> I usually like these types of weird little movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this one has failed to such a level that I consider it as the one of the worst films I have visited in recent years.
