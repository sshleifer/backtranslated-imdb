I can not believe I lost five hours of my life in this garbage. The offer of the previous five days of this author was very nice and I was really looking forward to seeing that. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit as she mumbled or stammered her lines, but most of the other actors followed her example. Notable exceptions are Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do not producers listen to productions before they are released to ensure dialogue is audible? As a result, I guess I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot seemed to morph to become the usual thing between Muslims and others, I quickly lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. A complete failure.
