This film is a vehicle of Schwarzenegger's clone, Alexander Nevsky. His charisma is however insufficient to raise this film above the level of his poor scenario. He has little to add to his Arnie-act. <br /> <br /> Michael York is pathetic enough as a beggar diplomat. Watching him revisit his act d'Artagnan since he was a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and unexplained relationships; At the top of this bill is Vlad's informant, who looks like an American, but who, in its context, seems to work for a Russian ministry. <br /> <br /> The story runs well after the end of the year. under the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. Contrary to that, Vlad is allowed to drive a police vehicle like a police car. The action scenes are poorly shot and lack dynamic. <br /> <br /> This is not a film to see absolutely ...
