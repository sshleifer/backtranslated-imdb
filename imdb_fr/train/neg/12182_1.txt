Well where do I start? I think it's very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie and I was expecting it to be a brilliant film, but I was very disappointed! the acting is awful, the original Annie was released a few years before I was born, I'm now 25 years old and Annie is still one of my favorite movies. So I was really pleased to see Annie 2. The acting was awful in the film, were there any original characters? very poorly written, directed and played. This is not a film that I want to see again, and any lover of Annie, I recommend you do not watch this film because it will leave you very disappointed. Young girls sing are not bad but still do not compare to the original
