This film seems to have been a training exercise on the job for the Coppola family. He does not seem to know if it's a western "A" or "B". I mean, the hero's name is Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must turn in his grave. <br /> <br /> All Western "B" clich√©s are here. The pearly-toothed hero with two cannons in white hat with the faithful knight ("C'mon Thunder"), the bearded villain all-in-black, the heroine in distress, the troubled breeder, the sheriff loose, at above wicked, etc. <br /> <br /> The action, with few exceptions, is strictly Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As a villain seem to feel more at home in a 30's quickie in Poverty Row. The addition to the cast of veteran artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins is helping a bit, but they are not doing enough to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine Coaching Sequences? Should we believe that Sheen's character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It made no sense. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Westerns of all kinds, I made every effort to find qualities that would redeem in this film. The cinematography was pretty good and the settings seemed very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, the other characters seemed authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers wanted to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might have thought of representing it as it was originally written - a graying ranch hand with a shine on it. his shoulder, the kind of role that Lee Marvin would have excelled. <br /> <br /> What can I say other than ... about Thunder, about the big guy.
