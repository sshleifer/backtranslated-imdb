The super sexy movie actress B has another role as future friend of the "Goodfellas" star, Ray Liotta, in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialogue, well, a word of dialogue actually. She shouts "Joe!" as Ray's character violates poor Pia Zadora with a plastic sprinkler. This film is so bad that it becomes funny, sometimes hilarious. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love that! Check out the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia is having a nervous breakdown and all her tacky editing effects and effects to try to show how much Pia's character is in panic. Pia plays a budding Hollywood screenwriter in this role. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes indeed. Pia can hardly speak, let alone write! Pia is totally and totally bad in this silly role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her role in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!
