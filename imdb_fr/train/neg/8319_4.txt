Pretty unimpressive. The "twists" are all pretty predictable, if you have seen a movie in the last ten years, and the few pretty interesting parts (where somebody uses context clues to make a decision) are few and far from has already been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty decent. The story is just not very interesting. The premise of "always awake" is canceled by astral projection (no kidding). <br /> <br /> The scene of the surgery is initially tense, a little embarrassing, but then becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, but not memorable. The least interesting role of Terrence Howard so far, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's boring.
