Just like watching movies at a neighbor's summer camp, "Indian Summer" is a nuisance that causes sleep. Eight former campers are barely introduced when incredibly boring flashbacks begin for characters we do not know. The good actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally lost in this movie. A camper's observation that "everything looks so much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you feel uncomfortable. The pranks are neither funny nor original, unless you think that the short film is a real "howler". This film was a big disappointment considering the many talents involved. "Indian Summer" did not make me nostalgic, just sick. - MERK
