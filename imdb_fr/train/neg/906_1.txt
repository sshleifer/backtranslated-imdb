Yes, this movie gives me a real horror, when I realized that I had paid for it and spent more than an hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just makes me feel like a psycho - actor Junkie and the girl is the worst actress I have ever seen. Believe me, if you enjoy your time to avoid this film, I understand that a movie requires money and that some movies do not have that money, but that does not justify a stupid plot and a bad game. actor. I always support independent films, when they deserve it, but movies like this have a bad reputation for this kind of movies. I am always traumatized. I will not trust any more beautiful cover.
