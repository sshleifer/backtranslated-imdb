I started watching this movie with great expectations. However, after an hour, I gave up this film because he had asked me only a few questions. This has already started in the opening sequence and has only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is an Italian comedian present? Why did the farmer's wife save the Hollander? Why, after being saved, did he not run to save his life instead of starting to make love to the farmer's wife? Why did not the farmer's wife save Hollander at a time when the farmer would no longer be there? Why did these supposedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comic hear about the Hollanders' gold? Why did he hide it in the cloaca in the middle of the property of evil farmers? These and many other questions arose and none of them seemed to get a satisfactory answer. So I guess I totally miss the purpose of this movie and I do not connect to the story in any way ...
