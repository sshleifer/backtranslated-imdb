It's a shame - I rarely watch a movie and I'm disappointed by the end. I saw quite a few adaptations of Ira Levin - "Rosemary's Baby" and "Stepford's Wives" - and loved them, but I just did not like them. <br /> <br /> When I read the intrigue book - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his alumni (Christopher Reeve) and prepare his screenplay for his own success - I was enthusiasm. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for those who have not seen it yet, but I would say there are lots of twists. So many people difficult to explain in detail the plot of the film, without revealing it. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists began to happen and at that moment, my interest and pleasure began to fade. Although I have to give credit to Lumet for the very fun ending that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Leading actors - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Although the obvious Russian accent of Worth slightly annoyed me (nothing personal to Irene, I think that the false accent of an actor would annoy me). I do not know if the character of Cannon was supposed to be boring, but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to look at it because from my point of view - give it a chance, you can love it, you can not. It's all about opinion.
