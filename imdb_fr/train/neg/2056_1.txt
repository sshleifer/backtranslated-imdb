Anyone who has liked Edward Ormondroyd's two classic novels will be disappointed by this film. All the magic and romance have been modernized from the original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady, and have received "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three walks in the 1800s on a ruined elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time to the Top. The second is All in Good Time.
