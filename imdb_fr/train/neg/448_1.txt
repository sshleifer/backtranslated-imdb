What I hate about this show is how the tracks are written. These women have no self respect or dignity. The whole plot is that they are throwing themselves on guys. The talent of Amanda Bynes is completely lost. She was brilliant in "All That" and in her own show. Why would they write it, Jenny Garth and herself, as empty, impetuous, desperate, in pursuit of men doomed to the "old girl"? <br /> <br /> Their intrigues and dialogues remind me of "The Simpsons," says Homer. Whenever his comic book character Poochie is not on screen, "Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?". The purpose of all the discussions is to complain about a guy and then complain to a guy. Sometimes they change it and the guy complains. Then they recover together or separate at the end. The two women are either shallow, stupid or sexually dependent. The only word I can think of is "suck".
