This movie is just bad. You do not even have to look to make fun of it. The whimsical teacher is simply annoying. Even by suspending disbelief to allow invisibility (which I gladly do for the sake of good bad movies) and allowing extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie requires even more than that. If you're looking for shower scenes in women's locker rooms and random sex encounters, get a porn, if you're looking for a bad or bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste your time on a bad movie boring, rent this.
