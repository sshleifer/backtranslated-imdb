The film is about a saber in an amusement park where teenagers go on a hunt for treasure. As there are no rules, they break into a building and begin to get killed. The dead are old and dumb. But at least its effects are better than those of sabretooth. I gave him a three because Stacy was in and I loved the Sabretooth movie. I thought it was ok, but some dead were off screen. There was a dumb scene where the two teenagers kissed each other and the raised sword's head appeared and the boy leaving his girlfriend behind leaving her to be totally wrong. Then the sabretooth gets up in the air vents and stings the children's heads. The end of the death with the owner was totally fake graphics. Even this death was stupid because the tooth was running through her mouth and hanging as if it were going to support her. There is a scene where a Gothic girl loses her contacts does not find them and does not seem to need them. The movie is silly and a waste of time.
