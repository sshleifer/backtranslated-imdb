Well, this film started in a fun way but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be a more "grown-up" humor based on the first moments, but the film then went on to a bad Disney Channel style, especially an incredibly long go-kart racing scene. Alana De La Garza is beautiful but her Italian accent is really wrong. The film looked and seemed very independent and low budget. There was a very cute moment that I would simply call the serenades scene, but overall, it was a yawn. Laughs are very rare. The last surprise of "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that it left me crazier than anything else. It may be worth watching if you can watch it for free or on TV, but do not waste your money buying or renting this movie.
