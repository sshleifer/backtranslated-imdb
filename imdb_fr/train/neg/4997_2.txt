... but it is certainly not without merit. Already a screenwriter-director, Preston Sturges experiments with unusual cinematic effects by telling his stories, creating distinctly drawn characters and situations, and writing an intelligent and sometimes unexpected dialogue of wisdom and compassion. (No wonder the Coen brothers' next film is a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The major problem is that the plot has not yet reached its goal; it lacks surprise, unexpected twists and sudden changes in fortune that make viewers guess. The coffee slogan is a ugly thing to hang on to, and the end is perfectly predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing a lot better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you have seen them before, then go ahead and watch them.
