I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so needless to say I bought this movie without even renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible, I did not even bring it back to the store, I would not want anyone to be subject to this human poison, I threw it in the trash, whatever the money, the price was worth it to throw it. The acting was not so bad, it was not good or anything. The story was horrible and the end was something that I despise. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a junk. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible tool to show his innocence in his childhood, a dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this end definitely irritated me. Jesus heals everyone ... I hate knowing people like this who are huge Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not cure everything, nothing. It was a horrible film, if you have the opportunity to see it, to pass it, or even better, to buy it, or to rent it, and to throw it in the trash, and to leave the coffee in the morning
