Having grown up with the Transformers of Beast Wars, I did not really know the first Transformers, and now that I've seen the awesome movie, and now that I've seen the old cartoon on which it's based, I have to to say that I love it The original cartoon and live action movie are more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL!" sounds a lot better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still allows me to firmly believe that he is a true commander, much more than the Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the character of BW was more like a humorous version of the most evil version of him in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what's cool, robots turn into animals or change robots in vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original transformers any day of the animal war!
