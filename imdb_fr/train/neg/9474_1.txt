Nowadays, life is difficult in Eastern Europe and for young women, prostitution is one of the few career choices that Melania reluctantly chose. She gets the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed, paying more and more money to spend time with her until he finally wants to buy it. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments and she is usually passed on as a baggage without any personal feelings. However, we are in the territory of "modern art cinema", also conventions like the narrative structure, illuminating the subject to see it, the camera techniques that add instead of distracting from the action and a vaguely coherent plot can to be abandoned. Most of the time, I had no idea what was supposed to happen and very rarely did I care. People started to leave the screening almost before the arrival of the last latecomers and I do not think I have seen so many people go out. <br /> <br /> The images are important to the director - the characters emerge or disappear slowly In a dark screen, we get long persistent shots of nothing in particular and a sex scene takes place in the infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary; the missionary positions between the naked people in bed abounded and there was no drugs or strange connectedness. But maybe these days are ordinary is unconventional. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost entirely without merit. <br /> <br />
