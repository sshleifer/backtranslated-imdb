I went to see this film in the hope of seeing some flashes of the Jet Li that surprised us in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his stunts are so obviously wrong that it took just as much fun. The flying kicks would be much more impressive if you could not see the wires holding him as he flew through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Too caricatural and very disappointing.
