Well ... tremors I, the original started in 1990 and I found the film very pleasant to watch. however, they proceeded to make the tremors II and III. Believe me, these movies started to deteriorate just after finishing the first movie, I mean, ass blasters ??? Now, only God is able to answer the question "Why, in the name of God, would they create another of those dives in a garbage bin?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie. In fact, it can not even be considered the very incarnation of a bad movie because it is worth more than that. As I tried to sit on it, I noticed that my eyes were starting to bleed and I was hoping that the little girl in the ring would crawl on the television and kill me. did they really think that dressing people who had watched other films as if they came from the Wild West would improve the film (with exactly the same occurrences)? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
