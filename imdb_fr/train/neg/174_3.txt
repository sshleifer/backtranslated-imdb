* Spoiler possible * <br /> <br /> 'Back to the cottage by the lake' is a useless film. The acting was not good and the plot was not even very interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The rest was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first movie and put a lot more into his character than in this one. It seemed that he was not even interested in following up. His game was good but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they do not even deserve to be mentioned. But I will do it. The character of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly she is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role had no meaning and it should have been thought a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His game was way below average and cast members should have looked for someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose, but his death did not seem necessary. The role for this role was good, nothing great, but better than Salem's. <br /> <br /> The plot was really ugly if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, goes on the set of "Cabin by the Lake", the film based on his screenplay. He comes across the director and soon after, the director is dead and Stanley directs the show. Yeah, out of nowhere, the team will just let this stranger get into the picture and finish the movie without knowing anything about it. There are murders, not many, and those shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set is electrocuted during the shooting of a scene. Another character is chewed by a motorboat. And we get entangled in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been difficult to excite. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed by the filming. The way he came back in search of reduced budget to normal began to get very irritating. In addition, the new cabin at the lake was poorly created. We do not show this, but only in a few scenes, and all with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first movie only because we were shown much more room, but it did not work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All but a few had no reason to be there. The game of what is little shown is really bad and ... they just did not have a goal in this movie. <br /> <br /> In total, "Return to the Lake Cottage" is a selection of choices from where the first stopped. "Cabin at the lake" I can take but it was not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this one and you too. It's not like the first one and it's gone too slowly. Nothing happened during the first hour and it continued to drag during the second. Not to mention the fact that the writing was horrible. Put this option only if you need help to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> We see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and doing well. By the way, it seems like there could be a third possible installment for a movie well by itself. Stop launching suites and everything will be fine! <br /> <br /> (Did not the filmmakers realize that they had shown us how they had filmed the scenes of the lake since the first film, all of which were filmed in a tank. , never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br />
