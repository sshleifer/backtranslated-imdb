Not too fan of that really. The story is rather horrible and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes and the good tickets. After that, it was pretty dreadful. Tim does not fit this role, he appears as a sufficient and self-inflated donkey. Pruitt Taylor Vince is quite unconvincing as a trumpet player. It's an idealistic film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after seeing it. There is no scene of 1900 playing or playing with his colleagues, he is completely indulgent. I have a hard time building a relationship with this kind of character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you do not have a real passion for life or a sense of what music is, then let yourself go to the suspension of disbelief and look at that waffle.
