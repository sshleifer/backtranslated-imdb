I rented this movie at the library (hard to find for good reason) only out of curiosity. I am a big fan of Plath and this movie was a total disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it moves away from the original text of the novel, but because it moves away without purpose or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What about the hokey voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the situation in Greenwood; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely amazing as Esther Greenwood (or any other 20 year old) partly because of the casting (she was 32 when shooting, Plath's age was when she died) and partly because of the fact that she can not act. Hassett is all emotion, no profession, no skill. The management is mediocre; the director simply covers what is there, which is not much The only reason I give the film a 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry, Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your beautiful work into something more appropriate.
