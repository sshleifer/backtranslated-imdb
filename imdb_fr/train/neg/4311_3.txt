I watched this movie when I was a young boy full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy as a movie I had ever seen or seen. It may not have been a good movie. I guess that was not the case. I do not really remember much, actually. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in ANY film has ever done it for me as Cathy has made it incredibly sexy. I have not seen it since I first saw it on television in the '70s and I do not think I'd like to see it again because I'm sure it would be a disappointment. My hormones are not so rampant. and I became more jaded over the years. Still, when I think back to the shower scene, I still remember how nice it was to feel. <br /> <br /> Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered that it was dangerous to go home. What was once erotic is now quite tame. The older woman thing - youngest man is still working for me, but not as much as in the past, probably because I'm no longer a 12 year old. This older woman is now younger than me. Also, the amateurism of the whole was not perceived by my spirit of twelve years. <br /> <br /> Morale: Sometimes it's better not to go back to the past.
