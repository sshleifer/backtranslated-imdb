I wanted to watch this movie since it first appeared on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see Last Night at 7:40. I regret the day I lost my ticket for this trash when I could see something better. The beginning was a pile of garbage and sexual clich√©s. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo guys. The boyfriend was too stupid for his age. The gases that passed by and that the pregnant girl was guarding had barely burst out laughing. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that were used in other movies. Their van was an old Chevrolet van that they thought had no break. Hey, why did not they have a nice vehicle for the flight? It could have boosted public opinion on the film. This movie was very low low low low since nothing in this movie was damaged or destroyed. This film contained many things that would make Christians mad. Hey, I was even expecting a car chase scene, because all the burglary movies have car chases, but I've never seen them so I notice this movie b, which represents the low-budget stars and 1 star on 10.
