I wanted to believe so much in this film after the only form of traditional comedy recognized by this country is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, he went completely to the other side - let's be cool and pissed off - and came out on the other side with little to show for that. I bet One Small Seed went crazy for that. I know SL had some. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have the comic chops to succeed. Even Danny K had better timing. I am really serious. Every time they introduced a little character, I kept thinking, "Damn, that person should have been the lead role!" <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that the work of the camera must be horrible. Black and white did nothing for this film - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it further hurt that boredom by highlighting boredom. Black and white was not clean either. The composition was horrible. The use of the music was horrible. Strangely, I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition was superb - maybe that's why the flaws of this movie come to mind. <br /> <br /> I think Horn (which was funnier than the first movie before even saying anything) was talking about this movie and not about David - see it and you'll understand. I bet those who organize Oppikoppi were dismayed. You would think nothing is going on there. I have the impression that it could have been filmed in someone's garden. I know some normal guys who have much more fun, thirsty and witty conversations than any of these "comics". The guy they hung with was good though. <br /> <br /> Guess, the comedy will stay in the Stone Age a little longer. Good job guys.
