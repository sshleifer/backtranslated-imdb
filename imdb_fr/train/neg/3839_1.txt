Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as faithful to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the management was mediocre and the race was too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to finish with that and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart never hit me as a talented actress, but all her movies were pretty low budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she drops her characters by screwing them up too much, talking too fast, as if the acceleration of her lyrics would make her more dramatic. She really lets us know that there is a team in front of her and that she is talking to a camera when she should engage the viewer in her character. It drops all the film, and any leg on which he could have stayed is ruined. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is when it got stuck in the end. But even that was not satisfying enough to calm my aversion to such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it if your taste in the movie is more bland than a piece of dry toast.
