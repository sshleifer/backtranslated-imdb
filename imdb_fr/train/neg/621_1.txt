Holy @ #% & this movie was still hot and juicy from the heap with which it was made. I was trying to look at this pile of purulent waste, but found it easier to cut my wrists and shoot a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than to support more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I classify it well below everything I've ever watched in movies or on TV, and that's saying something. I have already witnessed a cow poop in a field. I looked at the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... she may have moved or something like that. Well, it was better to spend time watching these guts. The acting was nonexistent, the plot was elsewhere than on this film. I think I saw very early a cut at a place where the plot had managed to escape and in the background behind a van going to Portland in the hope of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me that the director is receiving medications he desperately needs. It is clear that he needs heavy drugs and I am willing to pay the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Well ... I can not give this review the full punch it needs, because nothing so painful can be made just with typed words. Let me just say that if you are looking for a shot to spend some time and you see this Chilton on the luggage rack, head to your car, start the engine, then push both your fists straight into the fan until you reach it. you can not feel anymore. your bones are vibrating more. Make sure you have your wallet in hand too because you are going to waste money anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched this after a "friend" of me sent his girlfriend so I could see him. He had to come, she had it too. What's worse is that she had to look at this thing $% & @ TWICE! I heard their newlyweds now and he has to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
