This is a copy of Doris Day's 1948 classic, Romance on the high seas. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less the same but is contemporary. Govinda plays a quick-witted guy who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the university friend of the woman who does him the same favor. They are apparently trying to get caught off guard while the husband and wife are trying to fiddle with each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> During the trip, Govinda takes another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies her while falling in love with the lovely Rani. <br /> <br /> Lever plays the dual role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are opposed to each other to form the couple at war. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy classic classics and the songs are pretty dreadful. The comedy is sloppy and will not make you laugh too much.
