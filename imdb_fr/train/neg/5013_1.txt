I will not argue with anyone that this movie is execrable any more than the performance of January Jones, but please watch it, if you have not already done so, in Mad Men, CMA TV series, at from this month. She's excellent, I'm sure she took on the role of "Taboo" for the sole purpose of making money and, realizing how this putrid mess was going to be, played a minimal comedian role to avoid the famine. I do not know if that's the case, but I know now that she can act. <br /> <br /> At first, while looking at "Taboo", I was convinced that his flat delivery was a wise choice that would then give rise to a significant revelation about his character or plot. No chance. Hard to believe that the director did not suggest to him at least once that the fact of not changing his expression during 17 successive scenes could cause a lockjaw. <br /> Ironically. , his winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character who, at least in his first appearances, is very repressed, reserved, uncertain itself and rather colorless, not unlike his role of "Taboo". But as the TV series progressed, she began to blossom into a person who was questioning her traditional role as a mum of white breads in the early 1960s. I can not wait to see where they will take them. his character in the second season. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "Taboo" like leprosy, but take a look at "Mad Men".
