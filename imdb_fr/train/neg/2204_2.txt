I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a Power Ranger villain, and has approximately the same range of rubbery motion. This might be acceptable if the manufacturers were not as proud of its design as they seemed. That is to say, for a guy wearing a big rubber suit in an action movie / scifi / horror that could take advantage of a mystery, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. True, it is usually fragile and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume it's so scary that even the cameraman panics. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person about to be eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person about to be eaten, but now she is screaming and has no arms. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costume game is bad, the acting is mediocre and the special effects are mediocre, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL ME, the people who made this film have definitely adopted a more explosive = better state of mind. The characters shoot at the cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot at helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, whatever, they all explode, so much so that the bloody shark explodes even at the end. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, I do not care about the madness of a person, I find It is hard to believe that anyone can think that it is good to try to bring a half -Giant grandchild to have sex with a woman, in order to make fantastic babies. That is, EXCEPT that person is the mad scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is so random (and sometimes annoying) that even its wickedness is not enough for the long-term interest of the person. It might be a good choice for MST3K with your friends, but after that, if you happen to catch this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change channels.
