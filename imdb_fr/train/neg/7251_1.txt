Great Western, I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure of the movie you all watched, but it must have been different from the one I saw. Great Westerns or good movies of all genres have characters you can believe and this movie had none! The acting was mediocre to say the least, and I made fun of one of the characters, making the whole movie useless. The story was too long for the creators and maybe they should try it on television, as you see in the "FACT OR FICTION" shows about science fiction. <br /> <br /> looking for a good movie, a big western or even a nice hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
