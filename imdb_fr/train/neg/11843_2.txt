It's not because an event actually happened that it will make a good screenplay / movie. Peter Bogdanovich's Meow cat claims to be based on actual events during a cruise led by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a group of weird characters that he took the time to create a story that strange characters could inhabit. The key moments of the story seem implausible. For example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on a person wearing the wrong hat is trivial and artificial. The story is trying to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow lacks an important element of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for one of the characters. It does not matter who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to encourage. As a result, it is difficult to deal with conflict and the end result is incidental.
