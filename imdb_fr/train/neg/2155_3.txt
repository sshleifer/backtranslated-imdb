Good night, Mr. Tom begins in an incredibly exquisite village in southern England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we had a clear idea of ​​the period, we heard an announcement on the radio of the declaration of the Second World War. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when the shy William is lodged at the old reluctant and gruff Tom (who, you know, will have a heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a burden of sentimental toad. In fact, this is the old odd-couple buddy formula. Are not new stories being written? <br /> <br /> As I said, there is almost no period felt in the village and little more in London, apart from the old ambulance that trembles. And certainly no trace of the horror of the Blitz as London citizens politely enter anti-raid shelters. Even when the teacher's husband is declared missing, he is brought back to life. <br /> <br /> I found "Goodnight, Mister Tom" cliché and obvious and the accent of John Thaw evoked Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in the mouth making his accent "country bumpkin". <br /> <br /> Incidentally, my wife enjoyed this film for all the reasons I did not like it and looking at other nested reviews, it seems to me in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
