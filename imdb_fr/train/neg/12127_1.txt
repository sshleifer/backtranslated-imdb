Sorry fans of Fulci, but I could not get through this one. The soundtrack was about as annoying as it came, the acting was childish, the story was made and done, and the direction nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Honestly, Massacre looked like a children's movie project. But I've seen a few, and they're actually better than those! He seems to have been so underfunded that they could not afford ... NOTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, who, even at a distance, had no idea what an acting game was. It was a very bad movie experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was pretty much the worst sucking festival I've ever seen, next to Terror Toons, who's second behind Killer Klowns from space. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> He gives a score of 0.1 / 10 to ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
