I did not like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was released in the 80s, so I tried to watch it again to see if my disgust for this movie was due to my movie tastes in the 80s or 'It was' Stripes' is simply a bad movie. The verdict is pronounced and "Stripes" is a bad film. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 80s and could appeal to people with basic training. or who are Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mainly because "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not so funny. There are bursts of laughter, but they are rare. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is particularly striking if you are accustomed to more contemporary comedies such as "Anchorman" who strive to make the whole movie laugh. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" also suffers from Bill Murray and Harold The lack of Ramis' ability to act. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this stage of his career and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two actors are just not good enough as actors to carry the drama's dramatic arcade. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy "Stripes" revolves around the self-centered and intelligent man-child character, so if you do not find this funny character (as I did not not done), you will not find most of the little comedy in "Stripes", funny too. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is really a film of his time, he has not aged well and does not deserve to be seen. If you want to watch a comedy "Buddy" of the early 80s, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes", the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes", it has aged much better and remains visible.
