It's a bad movie, but I have to give it to the main actress in this one .... Francine Forbes. She seemed to play the least and I personally thought she was rather cute. Too bad it only appears in another movie in the database. On top of that, the movie is filled with scenes of gore and fake deaths. People are stabbed and GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch bad horror movies, I highly recommend it.
