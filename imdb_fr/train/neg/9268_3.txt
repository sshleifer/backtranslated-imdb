*** SPOILERS *** As in "Omen IV", the evil combination of the double game between Tinkers and Evers-to-Chance has reappeared. The evil seed of the late antichrist Damien Thorn is back. Terrorizing her parents, classmates, neighbors and finally the world under the name of Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being entrusted to a "deserving" couple, the Karen & Gene Yorks, Fay Grant & Michael Woods, by St. Francis Orphanage of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Little Delia wasted no time making her peasants feel by scratching her mother at a party at home. Later, Delia was nearly killed by a van on the run only to be saved by this "devil dog" named Ryder. While going to school, Delia takes care of the local bully by making the big boy get wet in front of all his classmates. Later, when her father threatens the York with a lawsuit, she cuts her head in a self-induced car accident! Delia is a person with whom you do not joke if you know what is good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalia's father, Gene, becomes a prominent man in town, or at least, he thinks, getting elected to the Clean Air Champion's Congress and from the crowd of green trees instead of letting the boys smog and concrete invade the neighborhood of eyes now on the White House itself! Does his strange and raw daughter, Delia, have anything to do with the sudden good fortune of Gene York? <br /> <br /> It is only later, when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth is revealed about herself. powers. Jo, a New Age guy, realizes that Delia is a bit odd, having blackened all her white crystals, and calls her New Age Noah guru, Jim Byrnes, for him to come and see her. Noah is so upset by what he sees in Delia Kirilian's color vibrations, all black and blue with a little pinch of red, that he kills him so hard that he almost fell into the mother's car from Delia. <br /> <br /> Taken during a trip to a psychic festival of Jo Delia, the event turns into a hell setting fire place, by mental telepathy, and raising all those hiding, including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with a broken leg. The shaken and beaten Guru was so upset that he later left the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> Jo is herself thrown away later, with the help of Ryder, the soft and cuddly pet, at the dying second floor window because she knew too much about herself and she spoke too much. It is then that Karen is pregnant again that she decides, finally, to discover the truth about the true parents of Delia. It is at this moment that she and we, in the public, are confronted with the truth. She is not only the Antichrist of Revelation, she is her twin sister! His brother the Antichrist himself is about to come on the scene as his little brother, Alexander York, who is not yet born! <br /> <br /> Three times is enough for the Antichrist to return to Earth to bring Armageddon. The publicized film was already starting to get a little tired of him and his bad adventures. With a fourth really not necessary since Daimen Thorn, the first AntiChrist, had been dead and buried for years. Have been subject to the usual ringing without anyone believing that little Delia is "you" anti-Christian until it is almost too late to stop her in her murderous cycle of destruction of the entire human race . The film, as bad as it is, is also much too long, 97 minutes, for a horror film that could have told that its story is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Having a private eye, Earl Knight, Mchael Megan Lehch, former Catholic religious sister, Yvonne, and now a faith healer, Felichy in the film, before being killed, did not help the plot. It only prolonged the suffering of those watching the movie. We could see the surprise come to an end almost as soon as the film "Omen IV" started with the cleansing of the bases allowing Delia to take control of the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a little surprising is that Delia does it with a little help from her friends.
