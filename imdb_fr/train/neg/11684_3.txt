This film does not make sense, there are holes in the plot big enough to get huge NYPD vehicles. The characters do not act in any plausible way. I'll put my comments on the discussion board, but save your time and money, it's stupid. I can not stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash-bang gear, uses sophisticated mounts and cool music, and does not bother to have a plot even at the most basic level. But it is good to see Denzel W. prevail over the man, who comes in 3 flavors: Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There is even a nice little boy with a video game who is nice.
