Oh, dear lord ... They made that movie that caused enough thoughts in a terrible testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this film was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of rods? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that made us understand that he was a fan of adrenaline and that he had probably spent his whole life trying to make it disappear forever. This point you see in the distance, where the left and right of the road meet, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and does not mean any harm to anyone. We have seen several times, when there were accidents, he stopped to make sure that his other driver was fine before leaving, even the cops chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he committed suicide rather than being arrested and living a life of captivity. He died as if he lived, running at full speed. <br /> <br /> In the remake, Kowalski has a whole story (including a name, even). He tries to go to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications. her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and an enthusiastic future father. He makes the decision to commit suicide after hearing that his wife died during the delivery, but they even leave CELA in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before she fell into the bulldozers. They even gave the role of "super soul", the blind DJ (brilliantly described by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!? !!!!! Leave me alone.
