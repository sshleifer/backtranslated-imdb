There should be a rule stating very clearly that films like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of ruining everything. RE was a horror game based on survival, and very effective, but Paul WS Anderson managed to make it look like any other video game movie. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so of course there is the slight hope that the director can get enough of the brain to make a horror movie and not a movie. action. Instead, Alone in the Dark simply proves that there is no hope that video games become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, although obviously not supposed to be important, is the most important of many problems with the movie. The film begins with what can only be described as five minutes of moving text that may or may not be important, because after a minute, the audience stops caring and sits next to the rest by hitting the object the closest. Then there's something about an orphanage, artifacts, an old tribe, a bureaucracy and demons, all so mixed up that the audience can not really follow what's going on. The characters come in and out of the parcel like sweets, some having a huge accumulation of meaningless deaths. What I can understand, basically, is that some demons have been released and that Edward Carnby (Slater) has a connection with them through an operation given to children from his failed orphanage. He finds an artifact involving the demons and reports it to a former girlfriend ex-anthropologist (Reid), with whom he is, of course, able to have sex immediately without good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose and they end up with a military team led by an asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> Everything is ridiculous, And the reason I do not really understand it is not only because it's complicated and confusing, but it leaves no room for anyone to care really. Instead, I urge you, if you have to watch this movie, to bring a tennis ball or something to occupy when the plot manages to confuse you. <br /> <br /> The action scenes in a film with a plot as terrible as that should at least bring it a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other shit in ruins ever made, with enough quick cuts to decapitate a henhouse. Considering that this is based on a horror game and not on an action game, it is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene featuring a man pursuing Cranby in a taxi is one of the worst I know and the rest is not that great either. The demons look pretty cool, although the fact that they turn into powder once killed removes all this effect. Scenes involving a lot of guns that need to be cool to look at rather imply the fire of mouth as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of an addict. It's all the kind of seizure crisis that keeps children in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Action is what I like to call taking actors and preventing them from doing anything. Slater only seems important for the whole movie, although he seems to have more talent than he suggests. The same goes for Dorff, who plays a thankless role despite his talent (something that has often happened to him). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, the sex appeal in the background, because every time she tries to act, it's a disaster (just like the incredibly bad scientist she's in the beginning). <br /> <br /> In all, This is the type of movie that worries me for future video game movies. If they continue to ruin this spirit, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran kills the people of the Middle East with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti fights a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one does not deserve a second chance, because I do not think anything can help me forget how terrible this movie is. It's bland, without interest and without excitement. This is the film equivalent of diarrhea; everything is put together, nothing is really going well and in the end, you're just glad it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
