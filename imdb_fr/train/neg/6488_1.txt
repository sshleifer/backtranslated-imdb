Yes, the subject is a direct quote from the film and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to death with this useless effort. All flashes, etc., meaningless after the first 20 minutes is simply a bad achievement. + If you're epileptic, you'd already be dead at least five times. Of course, all fans of David Lynch would raise a flag for this kind of turkey is "the best film ever made" because it does not make sense AND when it does not make sense, it must be art and art. the film is always good. Right? I say wrong. This kind of artificial art capture is just a pathetic way of trying to show that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins, as an excellent actor, should remain an actor.
