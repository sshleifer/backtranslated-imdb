"Three Bold Girls" is a crimson look at divorce, remarriage and the life of a lone parent. Obviously, social problems and economic hardship have no place in the perfect life of a single mother who feels exhausted, embarks on a cruise, then meets and marries a band leader. Even when the phrase "it's just a movie" dispenses the scenario of solving concrete problems, "Daughters" suffers from too many incoherent songs, children whose personalities are not based on real kids and on the leader of the group Hose Iturbi. Is not it strange that a real person plays the main role in a movie in which his real self supposedly gets married? <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was released in the forties. Only a love for romance and comedy in Hollywood could make "Daughters" a tolerable movie.
