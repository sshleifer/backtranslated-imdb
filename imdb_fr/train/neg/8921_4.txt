The beginnings of an African-American woman Scrooge in the troubled modern city were inspired, but nothing else in this film is. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a stingy banker who benefits employees and customers from the largely poor, black neighborhood she lives in. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban context of this film and that the script does not update the update. In addition, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so infinitely that the audience is well enough before the film reaches its usual end. This is a movie of messages that does not know when to stop. Cicely Tyson, talented, embodies a performance that is extremely tense and sometimes difficult to understand. Charles Dickens' novel has been adapted so many times that it is difficult to adapt it so as to make it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
