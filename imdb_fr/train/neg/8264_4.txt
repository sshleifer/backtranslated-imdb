It's a film where all the actors are doing well, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film where each of the three couples meet in a situation where we feel forced to be cute or put the story in movement. In other words, we get the impression that they are artificial film scenes, and not like in real life. Even if the women who work in the peep shows go out with one of their clients, this just does not seem realistic at all as it is written in this movie. Moreover, when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the movie, it seems artificial, the way they look at each other a few seconds after having quarreled. Once again, the actors are all good and the moments of this film are pleasant, but overall, it is another independent actor who could have rewritten before the production begins.
