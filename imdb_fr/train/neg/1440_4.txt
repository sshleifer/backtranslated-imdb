Swayze does not make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; who grew up was my ultimate hero in films like "Scaramouche" of 1952, "Prisoner of Zenda" of 1952 and "The Mines of King Solomon" (1950); Patrick Swayze fails completely. Even the portrait of an older Alan Quatermain of Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good in an otherwise very large flop. In addition, Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the main woman and, finally, the impressive Siriac in the role of Umbopa, it is very difficult for anyone to fill his shoes! For those who have been disappointed with the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, I now strongly recommend it if you can not get your hands on the Granger version.
