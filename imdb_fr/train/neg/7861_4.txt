The premise of this expected sequel was really good and after the resounding success of the remake, I was really expecting it. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is really absurd and inept. The situations are stupid and beyond reason and the acting is really horrible. <br /> <br /> This time, there are no friendly characters or violins unlike the remake. In addition, the blood is not very abundant and when that happens, it is really bad. The violence is minimal and it's a shame, because there are many arguments to suggest that there may be violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team chasing a family of cannibal mutants. You are surely expecting something different! When I watched it at the movies, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, it clearly shows how much pressed film is a mess and shows mediocre quality on all levels. <br /> <br /> A mess that has left fans of the remake like me. That's why suites are never welcome. at least, this movie is not as terrible as the sequel to the original in 1985.
