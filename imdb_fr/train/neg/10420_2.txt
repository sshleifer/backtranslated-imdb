Okay, I know that many people will probably object to this criticism, because Watership Down is a "classic" and standard element of most people's childhood. But, seeing this film for the first time at the age of 18, I must admit that: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people moaning in front of the words "Watership Down" - their memory of seeing the film as the children and their emotions torn at the seams, recommended it. To be honest, I would have liked not to be disturbed. I gave him the benefit of the doubt; In general, I do not like to stop watching a movie midway. It was an exception. It was really, really, atrocious, sickening. This movie was perhaps the slowest thing I have ever watched (imagine a snail spiked in space), and really did not do it for me. Art was good; the sets were well done, if it was a little bland and twee, but the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was rather hectic and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the huge details about the scenario; it is essentially the story of a group of rabbits leaving their labyrinth due to the infiltration of humans into the area. Generally a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions on the environment, he uses anthropomorphous rabbits to get the message across. As far as I'm concerned, I wish they were gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadist, but because the characters were uninteresting, boring, dull and generally quite rude (oh, I'm terribly English) . I found that I was constantly watching the clock while watching the movie, and it took about 20 minutes before anything really happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I had to praise in any way, I must admit that the idea of ​​showing children the dangers of building in the countryside and, hopefully, unveiling the arrogance of humans , etc., is rather well intentioned. Perhaps all of this is usually moralistic and preachy, but the message he is trying to convey is good in its nature. The partition was not bad either. <br /> <br /> To conclude, this film is rather mediocre. I could not watch it all the time, otherwise I would probably have to eat my own legs in pure boredom. Of course, the "couple" is not bad, but it still does not matter much to me. So I gave him a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope this will help you.
