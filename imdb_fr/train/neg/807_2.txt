I did not expect much from this TV movie. You need to set the bar lower than you would for miniature limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Nevertheless, he managed to disappoint, failing to even be a good or bad movie . <br /> <br /> Each scene was By Heart, as if someone had cut and pasted into the script scenes from a dozen movies and TV shows dealing with big business plots, leaned down back and says, "My job is done." Everything is clich√©, quite predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to give the impression of taking it seriously (even when the evolution of the plot is laughable). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They manage better. Also, let everyone know that attending a "fatal mistake" is just that.
