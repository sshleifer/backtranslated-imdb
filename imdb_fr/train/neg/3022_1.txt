I was very excited about this movie when I saw the previews for the first time. Normally, I see a good preview of this film and I buy the film directly. Something told me to ... you know how to look at it first. I'm glad I did it. Keira Knightley has ruined all future movies for me with this role. In the second movie Pirates, when he came out, I went to see him. I only saw Domino Harvey and I hated her more for that. I think it had to do with his hair and having to cut it for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or still worry. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I did not care about her character and even Keira, who was particularly naked, was not worth filming. Management was definitely lacking. The writing was banal and superficial. The editing was horrible. I do not care so much about the style as the bad use of it. There is a place for that. Fight Club is a good example of jerky editing, MTV style, colorful editing (I do not know if there is an official name); just above my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi-similar editing style. It has been used with taste and has not been used as a crutch. I mean it's the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, give me my time, please. <br /> <br /> I understand that many people liked this movie. I imagine that the idea that you completely like this film or that you totally hate it is a fair evaluation. Frankly, I hate it.
