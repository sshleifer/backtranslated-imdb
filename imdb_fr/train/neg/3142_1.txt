Once upon a time there was a director named James. He brought us wonderfully, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These films were the raw material of blockbusters and he hoped to have a fantastic future as the dawn of computer-generated special effects landed on the film industry. Terminator 2 showed us a glimpse of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then that happened ................ ... 1997 ........ innumerable rewards .......... obscene amounts of money ............ insane advertising dam ...... ...... maximum profit margin ... ..... The Titanic was there! <br /> <br /> I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be too critical for the sake of In fact, I have often adopted a position opposite to that of the majority, just to get an argument. But Titanic is a film from which I only got one positive point: that of Kate Winslett who is absolutely beautiful! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue resembled something of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting game was more wooded than my nephew's treehouse, terrifying images were actually comical (a man falling from 'a ship and hitting a propeller), historically false (do not get me started even because there are too many), there was a distressing musical theme (out there with the bodyguard during cheese) and the story Useless love was so tedious, so absorbing and pathetic that it did not respect the plight of all the other people involved (I was happy when it died and disappointed when it did not do me). <br /> It's obvious from the start that this image was designed to appeal to MTV watching, chewing gum, tracking a boy with a car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself looked like something less heroic than a fanatic member of a group of boys) who was dragging their hungry boyfriend's cock for a threesome a half an hour of chick-chick in hopes of being lucky later! The worst aspect was that it had not stopped at this point. Millions of old culture vultures have gone to see this expensive waste of celluloid because "it costs so much to produce it, it must be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies ". <br /> <br /> The crown of glory came when Titanic swept the boards at the Oscars. King James of Hollywood observed a moment of silence for the victims of the fatal night on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It seemed to me that he prayed for forgiveness after making a fortune by misrepresenting the circumstances that led to the deaths of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid enough and sentimental enough to buy this kind of garbage, they deserve to be ripped off. Good luck in Hollywood if that's how they want to make money, I would do it if I had that kind of chance in life! <br /> <br /> It's at the top of my list of the worst movies of all time with other ridiculous, historically false / human interest guts, like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor" .
