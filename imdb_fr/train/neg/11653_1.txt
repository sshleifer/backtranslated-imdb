The first was different and fun. This attempt should never have left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt of rude humor. The film selects current and old movies to rip off. This time, the jokes seem used and exaggerated. The audience with whom I saw him was just reacting to Hannibal's dinner scene and was asleep.
