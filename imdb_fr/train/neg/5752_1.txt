I do not usually comment, but there are things to say. Where to begin ... <br /> <br /> Jeremy London's acting role was awful! I did not think it could be so bad. The plot could have been good if it had been well directed, with a good solid performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that you read that you think has a lot of potential to be entertaining, but that disappoints you from the beginning. <br /> <br /> At least I laughed well. I would not waste my time if I were you.
