Oh man. If you want to give your Crow T. Robot a real training, here is the movie to insert in the old video recorder. The potential of cutting lines in this film is simply infinite. <br /> <br /> (Small messes to come in. Hey, do you care if a movie of this quality is "spoiled?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for this when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent. But this girl seems to have one for her homosexual, and I do not think there is a term for that. Maybe it's because her mother, Dana, is portrayed by Rosanna Arquette, whose cute overbite, neo-florist sexuality and succulent figure make me forgive a lot of bad movies or unpleasant characters. Here, Dana is not only ignorant of her daughter's conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal at the Indulgent Mother Olympic competition. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana misses Traci's lethal series, because Traci actually seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It's only because the script tells him to be able to count his whole body. <br /> <br /> A particularly hilarious note in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid described by Dana as She's been part of the family for so long, although she dresses up that the director thought: "I fell from the tomato truck of Guadalajara." Carmen is so wise about Traci's plots, she could also carry a sign saying, "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Indeed, Traci confronts Carmen as she returns from Mass and jostles with one of those slightly inclined studs that the car manufacturers place next to your spare wheel as a bad joke. I suspect rather than in real life that these things are as useless as murder weapon as to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette wears a fragile dress to a vineyard, under a cloudy sky, chatting with the owner. Cut off her in another fragile dress under a sunny sky, talking to the owner's brother. Then we cut her first dress, in the first place, under a cloudy sky - but that's supposed to be later. You get the picture. We are really talking about wrong direction. <br /> <br /> Regarding the skin, do not expect much, although Traci has a nice couple of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for a pile of garbage, 8. For all others, 1/2.
