It's not that I was really surprised ... The movies are never as good as the books they come from. I was anxious to see this movie because it's one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would be bad. I hoped to be pleasantly surprised. However, they have gone too far from the story of the book, and the movie version did not reveal how horrible this house was. The end was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked horrible because of a very bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was at best banal. Maybe if a theatrical version was created so that they did not have to stay in Lifetime's "Made for TV movie" box for so long, it would be a better movie. If you have seen this movie, I strongly encourage you to search for the book and read it. I doubt that you are disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
