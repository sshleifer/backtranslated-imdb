I really wanted to see this movie and waited months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When he appeared in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which made me crazy. I will give a chance to any movie, even if I want to get out of the theater / press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through, but I got nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting game was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; Although we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and finds himself in a psychiatric ward, we never see what he has "lost". Although we understand that he and Cedric are separating, again, we do not see him coming or WHY it happened. In an interview with Mathieu's doctor, CÃ©dric reveals that he had cheated on him once, but that did not matter. I was expecting to see this in flashbacks, but no - nothing. We also have clues that Cedric was the one who brought Mat to the hospital - but STILL we do not see him. <br /> <br /> I know that some movies are based on the principle "to take". but this film honestly checked me. When Pierre, Cedric's ex, arrives in the club and starts having trouble, we do not see him hidden before the end of the match and it took me a long time to understand that Pierre was the ex . His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are completely different. I can even go wrong by saying that, it was very confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything and move with its disjointed, misplaced and confusing rhythm. I can follow movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies with flashback / forward / back flashback, but CU has not captured and retained the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU lets you just hang. He has an air of pretension in his presentation "we will not tell you a damn thing, try yourself". It's as if you're reading a book with the reverse chapters and the missing pages. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was too disappointing.
