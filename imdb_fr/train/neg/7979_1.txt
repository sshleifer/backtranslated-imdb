This film has been slow but tedious and the acting has often drifted in the country of ham. The character of Redgrave was unappealing as a woman of something like 60 who was trying to compete with something from Thurman for the sake of Fox's character (why it's beyond me) The title of the film should have been "Shallow People" on the lake". The actors played as if they were in rehearsal. A terribly predictable end to start. I can not believe it's on this website like a comedy!
