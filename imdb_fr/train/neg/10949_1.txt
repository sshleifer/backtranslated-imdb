I go to the cinema to entertain myself. This movie has absolutely nothing fun. From beginning to end, there is no respite in the harsh gray reality of this woman's life. It's a rhythm, without a change of mood. I stayed until the end only because I was convinced that things had to get better. This is not the case, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many groans that resonated with the movies as the film approached gracefully. To honestly describe social depravity is not a crime, but to annoy your audience to moan is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. A terrible movie.
