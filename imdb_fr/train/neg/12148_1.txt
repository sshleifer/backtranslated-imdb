Honestly, who in the name of God has given this film a rating of 8.1? I guess it was the people who voted who made the film or played in the film. Otherwise this film is bad! This film is nothing more than an amateur film, even a student. I'm a fanatic of cinema and I've seen some terrible movies, but nothing really redeemed here. The story and the game are the worst I've ever seen. The accessories, including the use of airsoft light weapons with terrible special effects, were just as bad as anything else. I'm totally in bad language in the movies, but the F-Bomb was dropped about every three words and I think we could have a winner for most uses of the F-Bomb in any what movie. The film also seems to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. I think it will reward an amateur film broadcast only on public access channels across the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. It's a precious time you will never come back. Unfortunately for me, this time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this a warning.
