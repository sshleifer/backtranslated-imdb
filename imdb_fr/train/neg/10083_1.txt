They changed the title of this atrocity into an unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains dialogues that would be ridiculed during a third year recital. At a time when the woman leaves the husband, a bad recovery of All by Myself plays on the soundtrack! No kidding. The actors try but are defeated by the inept and incredibly terrible scenario. The management is incredibly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How are things like this one? I turn off the television before the end!
