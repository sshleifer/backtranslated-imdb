Joe Don Baker. He was great in "Walking Tall" and played an important role in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice", all hope is gone ... the dark side won. <br /> <br /> As for most human beings, my main experience with this one was done on MST3K, and what an experience! Mike and the robots plunge deep into Baker's abundant flesh and completely staple this movie. It is obvious that they were just starting with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick and that their continuation on a theme is here. <br /> <br /> This makes for a fun experience, however: there are many riffs to choose from. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for Sale", "That's" Meatloaf: Texas Ranger "", "None of them are worthy of a sponge", "Why was she wearing her dress? Prom in bed ", and my favorite -" 'Son of ...' 'What? What was he son: son of a PREACHER MAN? "<br /> <br /> In itself," Final Justice " is, as Joe Don says in the movie, "a big fat nada". But here it is actually an entertainment value. You have a chance, catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
