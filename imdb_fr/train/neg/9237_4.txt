Stalker is right! A girl sees a guy, a girl wants a guy, a girl invents banal ways to keep bumping against him, a girl will not leave him alone, a girl pretends to be patient, the girl can not stop talking of him, the girl pretends to love another guy (or secondly), he does not pay attention to her because she is annoying, the girl will NOT leave him alone. Well done, Drake's character could have been charming, but she's completely, completely, relentless in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her little girlfriend-cahoots is deaf, and unfortunately, Drake's attempt to play, "charming screwed "unfolds like," insane disturbing. "Grant is himself, as usual, which is good for Cary but it's as close to a performance called as I've ever seen him. The management is dull and the dialogue is simply obscure. <br /> <br /> Screwball's comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, as in this failed attempt, it stinks. Worse, Drake spends the entire movie in need of a lot of Valium and a restrictive order. It destroys any mood that is in this relic of drier mummy dust.
