If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous films and performances, you'll recognize many of the jokes made in this strange dreck. Written like a sitcom, this film fails to arouse any sympathy, from the self-taught doctor played by the sexy Molly Shannon, the liver always chopped, John Linette 'I'm fat and so funny. The 5 brides themselves are pretty friendly, and if that had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes as a male fantasy that strives not to be politically incorrect.
