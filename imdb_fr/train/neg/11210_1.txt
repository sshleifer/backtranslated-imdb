I read the story of John Everingham a few years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking what movie he would be great at. And that would probably have been the case if Michael Landon had never got his hands on it. As far as I'm concerned, Landon has been one of the worst actors on the planet and his artistic license has worked wonders, as evidenced by his massacre of the series of books "Little House". The acting game, for want of a better word, is awful, the sloppy scenario, and there are more close-ups of the Landon cat than it should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the history of Everingham as much as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the books on which it was "based". It's just another way to show the abominable hair of the Landons.
