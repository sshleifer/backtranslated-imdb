I'm sure Ladies Tricks was a favorite during car sales in the day. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you could miss if you were otherwise concerned. And if you needed to be in the mood for other activities, there were well-curved faces on the screen to get you in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not much to do with Operations Ladies. This is happening in the Korean War where a GI platoon with a British tommy goes a little too far ahead and has to go back to the UN lines. It's bad enough, but these guys also meet a failed group of USO girls and their choreographer in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad in this film is that it took a generation to a woman to finally be accepted into the military and in combat situations. These bimbos of the USO have put the liberation of women safe from light years. In fact, not even the bitten professional soldier who is the responsible sergeant for these men can keep him in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remind some of what they were at the drive-in for. It is best that this unnamed distribution allow me to recognize none of them for an individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operations Ladies is definitely a team flop.
