The problem with this film is that it was shot with the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera could not stay still because of a crisis or something like that. There is also too much poo and vomit in this movie. There is someone who vomits every twenty minutes and it makes me think that it was done by a bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there are the acute high-pitched cries that are constantly repeated and do not stop before the credits. I did not like the moment when all her friends were shot (or not, I do not know) and she gets into the van and puts group aids. It was really stupid to even have that in a movie. How much gas can a person siphon to start a van? That must be a lot because they do not run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I would strongly suggest never to see it in your life.
