The subject interested me and only the fans of Drew Barrymore dancing on the desk of David Letterman would find something interesting. OK, she shows breast (or maybe a double body). The plot is reduced to pieces and the acting is horrible. Neither leader has material to work with, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. Do not waste your time. Go see Donnie Darko if you want a terrifying film, Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another, ignore him and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the legend of Doppelganger is also absolutely criminal. Refer to Charles Williams' novel "Descent Into Hell" for an interesting reflection. It's just an excuse to make a B-movie to go straight to the video and give a little bit of life to Blockbuster people. <br /> <br /> Why do some of these people think the game here is commendable? Leave me alone.
