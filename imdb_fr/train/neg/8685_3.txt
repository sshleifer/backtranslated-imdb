Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a small series of cartoons with a lot of fun (but invigorated and exaggerated), Bush's jokes. I apparently should have reduced my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was absolutely pathetic. In addition to the Cheney-Chicken-Eat joke and some gigantic little strokes, it was really boring and not laughing. <br /> <br /> The animation was about as sophisticated as a 13-year-old Flash project. It is shameful that they have used the Macromedia product for this purpose because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush too much, and I appreciate as much a Bush joke as any other, but it was only half an hour of hitting the president with several painful moments unusual. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a lot more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, avoid "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the ephemeral comedy "That's My Bush". You will thank me.
