I am a MAJOR fan of the horror genre! I LOVE Horror / Slasher / Gore movies of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really the "good" horror movies. But this film has NOTHING to justify its visualization !! I will not spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible. The acting is horrible. The FX are not even worth discussing. The "set" is an absolute joke !! What is sad is that I think that some actors could have real potential, but this vehicle leaves them NOTHING to work! <br /> <br /> Just say I saw it "for free" And I got stolen! The time you waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat.
