A dreadful acting game, a lame plot, a stupid story and a dreadful movie sum up all this mess. It was unbearable to sit still. Simply horrible. Do not waste a dime for that. Movie theaters should feel bad about making this film available to people. This "horror" movie was not even scary, scary or disturbing. It was by no means visually appealing. The acting was so bad on the part of all the actors that any attempt to drag you into the film through dialogue is completely destroyed moments after the actor / actress opens his mouth. In addition to the whole story, I do not know why anyone would make a movie with this story AGAIN. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste a moment watching this movie. You will feel more stupid to look at it.
