Four years after making his debut as a director with the artist film "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us that what he really wanted in Hollywood was to be one of those guys. "Roadie" is a smashing game with fights in the bar, sexy harpies, Art Carney in a swollen wheelchair ... and driving Meat Loaf. Meat Loaf (who plays Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a pretty charming presence on the screen. Maybe in a less important role (in a better movie), it could be really ungrateful, but Zalman King's script is humorous stereotyped and helpless. The meatloaf is googly and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie all make appearances - and all look embarrassed. They should definitely, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO STARS of ****
