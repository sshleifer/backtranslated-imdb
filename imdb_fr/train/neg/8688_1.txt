If the only sex you have ever had is with a farm animal, the slogan of this movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. pleasure to try to look lately. I found the DVD hanging out at my friend's house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can not give you details without ruining the movie because there are only about 5 movie details. Just try to imagine someone shooting a movie on C-span, but the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring talk about c-span. <br /> <br /> movie, but I'm unable to say exactly what it was after throwing my eyes on me and throwing them on Richard Gere.
