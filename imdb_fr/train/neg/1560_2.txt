We can not even say that this film is bad because it is unfortunately mediocre. Without a mind or an imagination, a complicated scenario is put to the test and the "jokes" (predictable and lifeless) are reduced to a disproportionate length, so bored and gaping that quickly exceeds the viewer. Another notch marking the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what shocked us or amused us 30 years ago no longer works quite the same way. We have already seen everything before, and it does not break any more taboo, because they have long evaporated. A major miss.
