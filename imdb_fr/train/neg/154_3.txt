Watch this on DVD in the original language with English submarines. Either the subtitling was very mediocre, or the dialogue itself does not do much of history and gives no development to the character. There are a lot of HK stars, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright, colorful CG scenes are attractive for bright, brilliant colors, but they can quickly become overwhelming. If anything makes me think of a child's movie with its endless barrage of cg, battle scenes and intrigues. I'm sure I understood what was going on in the film, but the story was rather ugly.
