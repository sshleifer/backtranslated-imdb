For my life, I can not understand the good reviews on this piece of shit. It was useless. Matthew Modine was horribly misplaced as a leader. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I repeat, why this silly accent? Totally useless. And his game was just bad. I do not know if she was thrown by the accent or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl Modine was in love with suddenly starts to stuff half a head of lettuce and pretend? Where does this come from? I think we were supposed to have pity on her seeing her marriage with a workaholic begin to crumble, but frankly, I do not care about these people.
