In reality, this film is not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of the funny, yet he thinks himself hilarious. At first, the plot for sending the 17 letters was satisfactory, until Josh's approach, "look at me, I'm crazy," begins to infest every scene. The joke of Judas Priest is perhaps the least amusing thing I know, which says a lot, because it is strongly competed by all the other jokes of the film. And as for the incredible overuse of "Debating" Pixies, I have only one thing to say: what did the Pixies do to deserve a fate like this? What did someone do to Josh Kornbluth to make him write / direct / produce / play in such a terrible movie?
