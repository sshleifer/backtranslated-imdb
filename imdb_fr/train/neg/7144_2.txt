It was almost worth watching all this "awful" movie, just to know that I could never live such a serious experience again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (Nadia Bjorlin - 10 years old (she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress), plays the role of eight mile cheddar) This is the criterion that I used to average two. I lost count, but I think movie clich√©s, ever, are in this movie. When the driver who killed his father miraculously appears at the end to race against her, out of nowhere, it cemented the previous statement. Moreover, he presents himself for no reason. It has never even been mentioned before. I do not know what else to say here. Just watch when he goes out on television in a few years. At least this way, part of it will be removed for advertisements.
