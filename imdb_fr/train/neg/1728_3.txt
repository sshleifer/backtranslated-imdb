**** Do not read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a total surprise **** <br /> <br /> A plasticine plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks, not to mention your fast-forward button. To call amateur the "monster of Crater Lake" is exaggerating. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you probably will not be looking here in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that when there is no monster action going on, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in that it is completely designed in the way it configures the main action sequences. Nothing is too weird for "The Crater Lake Monster". He explains his dinosaur by a meteor crashing on Lake Crater, "overheating" the water to incubate a dinosaur egg that seems to have been sitting on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept the fact that the egg could have stayed there for such a long time and remain uncovered and viable, would the "overheating" of water at such a high temperature not cause the evaporation of most of the water. Lake? Except for some symbolic mists in one or two scenes, we do not see any trace of hot water, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty clearly padded in a few sequences, and it will do everything to bring the characters near the lake so they can be threatened by the claymation dino. A couple who has just crossed has car problems and while their car is under repair, they decide to rent a boat and head to Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think those aliens in history could be there for them to run into our title monstrosity? In a rather bizarre sequence, a drunk man steals an alcohol store and decides to murder the cashier and a passerby instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of alcohol. A car chase follows and you would not know it ... they end up right at the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yeah, it's not hard to understand and you're so far ahead of the script that you get upset when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. <br /> <br /> The shamelessness of all this is endearing, and I really want to love "the Crater Lake Monster". I just can not do it. There is not enough to keep going, and it's more like a movie to go to during a party, because you could talk about it alone and it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The film contains a very fine list of what is happening, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which comes in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head that 'We drag in wood in the water and a claymation insert completely made which is actually very pretty. There is also a pair of adorable sluts in it, and they carry the majority of intentional humor in the movie. A decent end lets us mourn the death of the monster AND one of our adorable classics. All the good sides of this movie are dead at the end. Why was I so touched by this conclusion? Was it the sad song played in the closing credits? Or was I crying the time I lost watching movies like this?
