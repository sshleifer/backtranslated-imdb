The DVD is very cheap and I am a real Drewbie. This is probably the only constellation in which this film could interest anyone. <br /> <br /> One of Drew's first movies, she looks great, and she has a lot of really cute scenes from her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a number of sexy outfits etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know of her latest movies. <br /> <br /> The film itself is rather medium or under-medium, and looks much more like a movie made for television than a film for the cinema. There is no real horror or accumulated tension and dialogues are often tacky. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end, because honestly, I do not understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand anyway. But at least you're not getting the end you expected, and it's also happening much earlier than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
