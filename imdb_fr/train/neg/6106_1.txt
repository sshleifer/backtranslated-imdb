It was just awful the plot was just OK, but the rest of it was bad. I mean, come to the puppet and then they even tried to make the digital movie and it made it even worse! Normally, I would like a low-budget movie, but it was a waste of time and almost made me want to go back to the scene on which it was filming. I have about ten sets of low budget movies with 6 to 8 movies and I have to say it's the worst movie of all. Plus, the wording is wrong and they use a fake plastic machete that does not even look like a real one, they could use one that looked a bit like a real one, save your time and money, and do not watch that movie horrible.
