Apart from the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious imbecile, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing in Lopez has ever been funny. I looked at his stand-up and I never uttered any resemblance to a laugh. <br /> <br /> Its content seems vindictive and its animosity towards whites oozes from every pore of its body. <Br /> <br /> I laughed at the jokes of the whites of a lot of comedians and like a lot of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that does not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> Issue intrigues are always a cookie cutter with a Hispanic accent. <br /> <br /> A loud laugh in front of the most stupid comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps why this show is still at 2 am in the morning.
