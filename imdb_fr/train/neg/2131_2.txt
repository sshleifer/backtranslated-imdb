I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical touch (as this movie was touted) but this one lamentably failed me. For me, the plot was a little confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I'm really sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for taking part in this film. I will remain a fan of all, but only time can heal my feelings on this one. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary has interpreted Yonica's character so well that I did not even recognize her. It took me a few scenes to realize it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 per Red Box; If I had paid to see it on the big screen, I would be really mad !!
