You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and must speak, is played by Stephen King. "Do not give up your daily work" is the norm to say, but it's not fair. King is doing reasonably well: he is no worse than any other cast member and better than most others. History, on the other hand, is pure hogwash. Please, give up your daily work. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such dreadful performances - of which the main actor (the main actor!) is probably the worst - united in a single film. Everyone acts in a hurry, but not in an entertaining way; they all manage, one way or another, to do their best without spending or showing energy. I blame the screenwriter / director Tom Holland. It's impossible that ALL actors are REALLY as bad. What are the chances against this? Of course, I have never heard of any of them before, but I still do not think I could go into an art agency and go out with so many bad actors if I tried: an actor, despite all my efforts, would turn out to have talent. So what's more likely - that Tom Holland has rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he has written an ugly scenario and then mishandled it? This would also explain why the actors are directly proportional to their importance in the scenario. The more an actor had direction, the worse his performance. ("Do you want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk to the bottom of my throat, show all my teeth and be bored at the same time?") <br /> <br /> The theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland has undeniably managed to co-write a lousy scenario. Several writers here have commented that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but it is a misleading way to say it. He is not a knowledgeable person. All we discover about him before supernatural things begin is that he is fat and can only think of food. ("All I can think of is food," he told us kindly.) And at the end ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I guess I should insert a spoiler warning here ... <br /> <br /> In the end, he becomes mean. Why? I can only shrug. Maybe he is under a kind of enchantment. Yeah, that's probably it. By "evil" I mean perhaps "inexplicable" - it is not so much evil as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary medium-term psychology. Be that as it may, his actions at the end have no meaning, no action makes sense, and this despite the fact that the characters explain very little, but explain their motivation for the benefit of the public. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my nominee for the line / delivery hammiest: "I do not think you would like that .. IN FACT ..." [big dramatic pause] "... I do not think so that you would like that at all. "
