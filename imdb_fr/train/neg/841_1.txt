I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I just watched. I think it's basically a movie about a S & M "star" on the Internet of CD-Roms that are about as realistic as online flash cartoons. She was murdered by someone, which led her sister and a team of two FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division in Big City, USA, is also conducting an investigation, although most of his work is about looking for CD-ROMs that he says are as "real" as they are real. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie to have any credit behind him. He is in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of that is to hit the main girl for no apparent reason. I will not even explain the end, because frankly, I can not understand it myself. But before the final scene, we attend a montage of 3 or 4 minutes of all that is in the film. Honestly, they could have seen the final scene and then the same effect with crossed eyes. <br /> <br /> Overall, stay away from this movie. I have it because I like bad movies and I like Michael Madsen. I really could have used these 80 minutes for something else and be more satisfied. For example, play this game with a knife where you prick your hand several times. It would be a lot more fun for 80 minutes.
