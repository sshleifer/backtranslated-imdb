Jean Seberg did not have an iota of acting talent. Like all her films, "Hello Sorrow" does not suffer in any way from her appearance (although she may be the first of these modern women whom Tom Wolfe joyfully describes as a "boy in the chest": the publicists use of course the word "gamine"), but suffers seriously from Seberg's dull, monotonous and deadly voice. In all her films where she had to play with anger, Seberg played it with roughly audible, distracting and panting words between her monotonous verbalisations. Oy. <br /> <br /> Preminger's adaptation of the fantastic, juvenile and spooky fantasy soap opera is remarkable only for its lush cinematography - but it's hard to do on the French Riviera photogenic, and perhaps also for his apartment, but certainly not revolutionary, use of black and white for the current scenes of which the monotonous narrative of Seberg delivers us to the flamboyant past. <br /> <br /> Juliette Gréco has for a brief moment, as a disco singer the black and white projector, delivering in a smoky Dietrichesque voice the lamentable existentialist lyrics of the title song. In retrospect, this moment is more than a little funny. Except, of course, if you are French - especially if you are a French "68-er" eager for the glorious days of barricades at the roundabout of the Sorbonne - and your children do not hold sinecures that lasted a lifetime and who have emasculated those of the French economy: then you always believe in Sartre and Foucault and all these mysterious and insignificant theoreticians. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the most difficult role. He has to play with enough gusto of an aging hedonist who has not yet understood that life belongs to him. All about Sagan's Teenybopper notions on a hip, cool, swingin ', "my boyfriend!" Dad. Deborah Kerr assures her habitual, professional and professional presence, convincingly interpreting the woman who is needlessly suffering from Seberg's rudimentary teenage jealousy (realizing Sagan's superficial adolescent fantasy of the classic theme "there can only be one queen bees in the hive "); In fact, Kerr belongs to the one and only memorable moment of this film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not natural - I agree with another critic who said he seemed "poorly translated" from French; combine unnatural scripts with Seberg's incomparably dull and unbearable monotone and you can save this Valium for another night. Above all this, the unseen synchronized post-production dubbing is almost always obvious and therefore much more than annoying: this is particularly true for the dubbing of Mylène Demongeot, because it ruins her stupid blonde performance. <br /> <br> Hunky Geoffrey Horne finds here the small end of his stick - a very handsome young man who also suffers from an unattractive and uninhibited voice that, combined with Seberg's drone, produces unconvincing scenes of puppy love. (Horne was, shall we say, just enough in "Bridge On the River Kwai", perhaps because his end was delayed by these great film professionals, William Holden and Jack Hawkins, instead of not being supported by the regrettably undeserved Seberg). <Br/> <br /> In summary, "Hello sadness" is pretty to look at but it's a shallow and immature soap: fine oatmeal with moss.
