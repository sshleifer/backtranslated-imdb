I picked up this DVD at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on 2 for $ 1 support, but as Michael Madsen was on it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I had bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I must say that I have not seen it. I do not like the movie The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that the use of flashbacks by the director adds nothing to the story. I would have preferred to see the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not cast him as one of the other commentators, but it may take some time before I consider this film again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since this was Michael Madsen's first film, it might be of archival value at a later date.
