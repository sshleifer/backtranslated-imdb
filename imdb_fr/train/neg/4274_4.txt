We are not in the naked emperor's fairy tale. We can confess the truth about what we see, without being stupid, admit that this show is simply incomprehensible in many ways and that it is clear that a large part of it was created from a pure intuition and without a real concept. <br /> Of course, many people like this stuff. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. And I also admit that the series is much too serious for my taste and boring ... these stories of love and drugs ... There are so many exciting soap operas with a lot of suspense (Dallas for example), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about those people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
