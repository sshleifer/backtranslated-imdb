I watched the version of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings halfway through the reading of Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At that time, the animated version of The Lord of the Rings came out on DvD but I told myself that I would finish reading the Two Towers and the Return of the Kings before watching it (because I thought that it showed the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought the DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely nil. <br /> <br /> I was really bored for 20 minutes, which was really strange because I love the book and I'm shaken that the maker of this movie might even think about adapting at least 1 and a half pound to a movie of 2 hours 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had emotion when they spoke and they seemed to read a page, even my favorite character that is Gandalf did not seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only thing that suited some parts of the film, except for the orks (they looked awful) and the faces of Aragorn and Sam. > <br /> I do not really know this movie was released because there was not even a correct end, but maybe it was good that the manufacturer ran out of money because the movie did not could not be improved. <br /> <br /> I only hope that no one will judge the books of this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
