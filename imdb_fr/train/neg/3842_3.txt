Our teacher showed us this film in first year. I have not seen him since. I just watch the trailer though. Does this sound like a first-year movie for you? I do not think so. This film horrified me so much that I could hardly watch it. It was mostly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was panicked by this movie. Today, at 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and my opinion that little kids should not see this movie, even if it's PG. Be aware of the possible consequences of showing this to children. I do not even remember what it was, once was enough!
