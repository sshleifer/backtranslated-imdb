It's a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately, it's not a good movie. What begins as a sweet and almost silly romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with her uncontrollable Fluffee spirals in a bizarre combination of genres and a real stew of scenes, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious "dash" of 400 moves towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, in the end, this film produced and purified does nothing. However, the actors are all playing with the material and there are some good laughs in the backstage gay porn scene. <br /> <br />
