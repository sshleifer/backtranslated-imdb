You can not really go far when the initial story is not so great. The principle according to which the blood necessary to Cyborg is purely doubtful. <br /> <br /> The script is jaded '. The actors do not have much to work. The sets were staged in the desert to reduce costs. If the bottom is desert, the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> The lack of budget is acceptable, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are decent work examples of no $. but this film gives them the impression that they have to collect their currency to buy a sandwich from the cameraman. Again, forgive if only the story is not completely nil. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film commits the greatest crime of all: it does not finish! It just ends up as if it were a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Simply strange. <br /> <br /> Simply bad.
