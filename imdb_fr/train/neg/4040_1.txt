I consider myself a little snobbish when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more conducive to explosions than big drama, I can also be very stuck in the movies. <br /> <br /> Not all Art films, however, are better than King Kong. It is quite possible that I give Kong two stars, doubling the number of shootings of this film. <br /> <br /> I guess people were so excited about it because his style was almost identical to a play. For less savvy art lovers, a movie that looks like a play is a "great art". <br /> <br /> However, this film was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any history so he relied on the great drama. The only drama in this film was whether the cat would fall from the roof or not. So, a deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No, good acting? Barely. <br /> <br /> To be overly fair: some landscapes were interesting: Communist apartments, city panoramas (Petersburg?) And Soviet trams still in service.
