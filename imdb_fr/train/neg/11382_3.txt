Anyone notices that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes watch he gives each enemy 2. Holding hands facing each other, gaping mouth and frightened eyes. 3. The smile Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I must say that I hate pretty much all this show, I do not look at it but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all watched at least one, I have to say that this show is on the verge of racism, interest and anxiety. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with Robotboy's victory, with one exception, where Robotboy essentially let this fancy geek fly away with a jetpack. </ The jokes are pretty raw too, I think it's mostly people who say the word "Suck" or fart, I think the bullies in the series are quite shocking too. <br /> <br /> Is not there one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school he goes to. Not to mention his older brother, who is a psychopath at the limit and who has no other qualities of character. <br /> <br /> The whole show, I have the feeling, is tearing mega XLR and Fosters. As you might say, the trio of coop, jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy look like Megas where he beats everyone, no matter the odds, and he is free-spirited despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There is simply no call to this show, I am surprised that it continues to work.
