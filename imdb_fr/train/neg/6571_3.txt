Although I totally disagree with a reviewer who described Charley Chase as not funny, he certainly is in this movie. It's a shame, because I suppose the other reviewer only saw a few failures from Charley Chase and assumed that guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good movies of Chase, so it could be really funny with good material. Unfortunately, in this film, he gave absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the good Oliver Hardy as a foil does not help, because the basic principle (a boy wants to marry a girl but his father thinks the boy is a werewolf) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for the regulars of Charley's look from the mid-1920s, you'll be pretty surprised Chase does not wear glasses or mustaches - and does not look like what you'd expect.
