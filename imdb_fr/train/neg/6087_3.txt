This film was not as corveux as I thought. There are a few seconds of glamor in this paranoia-fest of hardcore UFO conspiracy somewhat silly. Most of the actors are mediocre, but typical enough for a 1970s style filled with pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model witness strange events in the woods and are quickly victims of these acts. We see flying saucers, more people are disappearing - but are they extraterrestrials or the ultra-secret group of camouflers of our own government? Soon, a journalist and an "uflogologist" (apparently inspired by the character of the screenwriter-director) are trained in this fiasco and become the target of ultra-secret agents as threatening as improbable and without intelligence. So the pleasure really begins. <br /> <br /> The film, as expected, has just as much meaning as the UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for being so serious. The work of the camera is acceptable for a low-budget movie, the pace is pretty good, the script is ridiculous and absurd, and there are continuity issues that are fun to watch. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you more without writing a spoiler. Suffice to say that the end of the film is at least worthwhile to move quickly if you can not take the middle.
