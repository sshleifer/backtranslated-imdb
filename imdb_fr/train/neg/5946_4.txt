There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing. But there are some good fight scenes that are actually quite good. So here ... all in all, the movie is pretty bad, but if you like brain-less movies that only have good action scenes, watch this movie. Do not expect more than that. A decent acting game and a not so bad direction ... Some cameos from Kimbo and Carano ... I was looking a little more to see Carano in this movie ... she's a good fighter and a really hot girl. .. White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art. Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... it would be great
