(This is a review of Disney's English release, starring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and Co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the rave reviews about this Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, by the quality of this film. These latest movies feature well-crafted intrigues, three-dimensional characters and the best movie music since ... well ... never. This film just does not approach. <br /> <br /> It should also start with the positive aspects. Like all of Miyazaki's films, this one is still very imaginative, with a strange fantasy / science-fiction setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast an animation far superior to other films of her time. (although not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the English dubbing is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not ... good ... The characters are all cardboard - from the sweet Nausicaa sweet sage to the mercilessly devilish Tolmekians, to everyone in between. Once you have seen each of them for 30 seconds, you have seen everything. And the fact that the plot continues to turn is useless. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music ... Now, Hisaichi is without a doubt my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa does not do him justice. Half of the music is composed of overdrive 80s keyboards, and it usually comes in and out so abruptly that it distracts the visuals instead of helping them. I strongly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a good deal of the music before even seeing the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message with this movie, right ?! Let's save all the environment! Too bad that this film hits you in the head like a hammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. Not really. I am not joking. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about the debility of this film. But for some reason, all the other critics on IMDb seem to love it. And when the characters have to talk in long sentences to tell you what's going on, it's bad. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who worships Anime, likes 80's music and plants a tree every day from Arbor, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for later movies because they are very popular.
