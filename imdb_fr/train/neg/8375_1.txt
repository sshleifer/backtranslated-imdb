America. A land of freedom, hope and dreams. It is this nation that, since independence, has striven to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the world for the good of all humanity. There are, however, times when we can not help but wish the Americans to stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This "film" (and I use this word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a whimsical jewlord who was created by tying Marlon Wayan's severed head to the body of a two-foot dwarf. After inadvertently depositing a big diamond in Vanessa's handbag, a career woman who is reluctant to have children, Calvin realizes that to get the diamond back, he has to have fun with it. Then, like any normal man, Calvin disguises himself as a two-year-old child and parks at the threshold of the poor woman, where he is discovered by Darryl, Vanessa's husband. <br /> <br /> Darryl cracks for Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the "baby" has all his teeth, a stubble, a tattoo, a knife scar and the old sexual drive. Even more absurdly, Vanessa does not see beyond Calvin's baby clothes and is actually trying to nurse the tiny pervert. This miserable assault on the soul of humanity tries, unsuccessfully, to find humor in rape, scatology, sexual assault and pedophilia, but in a dishonest attempt to turn into a "family entertainment" that the Wayan brothers introduce a disgusting amount of sentiment and morality. <br /> <br /> The two brothers try to rehabilitate their rapist thief to rehabilitate him in Freudian by revealing that he "had a bad father" Striking Darryl in the crotch time and again allows Calvin to develop the father-son relationship that he and Darryl have always wanted. As if that was not ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it's selfish for a woman to indulge in a successful career and that she should rather spend her life playing the role of the little housekeeper. who spends her time alternately taking the babies out and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Wayan brothers mixed their rude and twisted humor with the clich√©d sentimentality that has contaminated much of Hollywood's recent work. In addition, they are endemic to the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of self, who indulges in jokes on their feet and brutal sex gags. By their rights, it should be legally forbidden for these two to take pictures that look even more like a camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that at this time, next month, they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and they will win millions of dollars thanks to poor merchandising agreements.
