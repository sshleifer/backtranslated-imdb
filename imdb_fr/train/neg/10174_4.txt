I saw it in 1994 when it was finally released. Apparently, because Orion's pictures were bankrupt, I think the film was not released a few years ago. I remember it as a very boring movie. I kept debating whether to get out. The store was not at all interesting or attractive. Was an imitation of America's 3rd graffiti rate. <br /> <br /> None of the performances are worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.
