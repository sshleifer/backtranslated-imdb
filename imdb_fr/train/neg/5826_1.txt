Slow and enjoyable images mutually transformed each other, with sometimes annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the film. If you have not slept enough, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20%, the director decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, reincarnation or, by means of images S & M: "spiritual lovers" cut the body using knives. For me, this has been very disturbing and has really changed the overall impression of a mixture of abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the manager are excellent, but weird. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all.
