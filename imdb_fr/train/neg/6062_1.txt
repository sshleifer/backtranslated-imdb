Sensational. The only people who look at this positively are the Carpenter apologists. I know a lot of these. The guys who will watch John Carpenter crouch in a celluloid film and call it a horror masterpiece. This "film" is a total shit. It looks and sounds like a porn (well, the soundtrack is awful ...), and there is an underplay, which is shocking, because normally, Ron Perlman is a really good actor. Honestly, I have no idea what Carpenter was thinking about. Most likely "Beans, beans, beans .." until someone fed him and wrapped him in a blanket for the day ... They say nothing about the abortion debate, while they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious anti-abortion zealots feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his children terribly agitated, killing a bunch of people and leaving the horribly cast doctors try to calm the pregnant woman, hysterically bad. Not one person from this episode or whatever you do, you should come out unscathed. It's just horrible. Like, Plan 9 From Outerspace terrible. Good God please, someone would turn it off before I feel horribly bad. Try to watch this and the same day thing and your mind will implode.
