This time we have a psychopathic toy maker named "Joe Petto" (get it?) That makes diabolical toys live that kill people. He attacks the family who has the bad luck of simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again get it?) Were alive. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and, hopefully, probably the last) of this half-series, this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's a bit like a low rent hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad movies at home. Supposedly, in 2000, they started making a sixth chapter of the series, but this one was abandoned and never finished. We can all hope that this remains so ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star on **** <br /> <br />
