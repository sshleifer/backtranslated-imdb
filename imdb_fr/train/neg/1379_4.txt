The satire of Monika Mitchell's showbiz has bursts of laughter and premeditated violence. I would not say soaked with blood; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has a unique and adaptable presence on the screen, but he has a terrible reputation for being chosen for the roles he goes after. There is always a producer nephew or a seemingly trivial reason not to be assigned the role he is looking for. The best thing to do is to get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a test shot. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos from Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's show business ... or is it?
