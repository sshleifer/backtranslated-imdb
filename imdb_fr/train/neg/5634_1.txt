The poster that called this sentence "baseless and irrelevant" literally took the words I would have used in my subject. The only thing I would add is "no passion". For a film made by a married couple of real life and featuring many graphic sex scenes, this film manages to transform what should be a sensual situation into one beyond the ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a Valium and finish it. In addition, the women in the audience saw MUCH too many tampons used in their day and any guy who marveled at seeing Willem Dafoe removing a bloody swab from his wife's vagina really needs treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the scene of the restaurant where a waiter explains to Dafoe, who has his eyes still asleep, what is a "deconstructed jambalaya" ". (All the ingredients in the dish are still separated rather than simmered together.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are present: goosebumps, isolated houses, dead spouses, scary violins on the count, weird guardians who come and go as they please, dead and nearly dead in a car accident, characters with a secret past. Basically, every clich√© thriller you can think of, but NOTHING meets. Everything is right there and never fits into a coherent plot or even a piece of artistic humor. At the restaurant, Dafoe transmits the "deconstructed jambalaya". Future renters of this mess would do well to let this thriller deconstructed on the shelf of the video store.
