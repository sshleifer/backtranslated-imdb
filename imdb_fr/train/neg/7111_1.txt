- A newlywed couple moves into the house of the deceased husband's former wife. The new wife soon begins to feel that someone does not want her at home. She sees skulls all around the house. But when the husband investigates, he finds nothing. Does anyone try to take her back to the asylum where she has just been released? Or is the ghost of the dead woman trying to get the new woman out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watch The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K crew. And it will probably be the last time I look at it that way. Can you say dull? I'm not talking about ordinary boring - I'm talking about watching the grass become dull. There are big parts of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have been empty and I would have had so many distractions. The characters constantly buzz with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The screaming skull could probably be sold as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not help much. Most of them deliver lines with the belief normally reserved for a school game. I did not take a look at it, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this film appeared in a film with cinematic value. I will not even get into the scenario with which actors have the task of working. Let's just say that the characters are receiving some of the craziest lines ever set in a movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Avoid it at all costs or look for the MST3K version.
