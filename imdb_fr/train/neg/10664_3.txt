Burt Reynolds, a very tired man, plays the role of a mercenary who fights against his former employers to get a gizmo that these non-heroes plan to sell to the "Iranians". The low-rent video nonsense of the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offers decent action sequences and a lot of "dramas" impressively staged ... a lack of logic and a really dreadful dialogue are the determining aspects, well that the final twists and changes of allegiance could have been a clever end to a better movie. Burt is always present, although it also means that you will notice more when he mouths insulting and half-cooked "one-liners".
