I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's awful. The case: Mom and daughter are driving to bed and breakfast, mom stops to get gas, a gas station crazy, weird, angry at her husband who runs the B & B tries to rape her. She escapes, goes to B & B and instead of sweeping her husband and wanting to call the cops, the story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other deficits in the logic of action abound. Acting is also lukewarm, and the neighbor's warning is given in a really cheesy and badly played moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense gore / death intermingled unevenly with warm scenes of thrilling interactions between characters. <br /> Less attention to gore, more attention to mood and story would have been appreciated.
