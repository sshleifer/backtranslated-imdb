For those who have little time, I will summarize quickly, in a word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this film fits this description perfectly. So you can barely cover 2 minutes of screen without seeing something completely stupid and useless forced. Do you want a completely naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason she appeared is so useless if she really sets the tone for the rest of this juicy shit. You can almost get a glimpse of the disturbed minds of 12-year-old boys who wrote this trash just looking at this shit they expect the public to pay !! !! !!! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've watched the decline of many movie franchises, but American Pie; Beta House must be one of the worst offenders considering that, despite the average of the original film, it remains a thousand times funnier than this sinking. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and sometimes you sometimes feel like watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually look at it (we're talking about Star Wars suspension levels, like the one you need to convince you that Jar is real) <br /> <br /> The plot is very thin and most of the events that are happening are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up another pathetic joke. There is no actor talent to speak of, all you get is a group of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Each gag fell flat and the only thing that made me laugh was how much the writers seemed to be socially unaware. If not, how can you explain the bulls ** and they try to pass for a story? <br /> <br /> They miss out on every opportunity to do something useful and fun in favor of a common sense nonsense badly written and poorly written. Characters have to complete a number of tasks before being accepted as Beta House members, but this is mostly handled by a series of very short montages that imply that they perform the tasks, but we see few or no evidence. is really happening. It's a very lazy way of telling a story. (Imagine that the Wizard of Oz is in the place of all the important events that have taken place on the screen rather than on this one, and that all we see is Dorothea, who watches from time to time the scarecrow and saying it was a beautiful adventure that we had just lived at the time ") Lazy LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is undress for no apparent reason and are used as visual aids throughout the movie.Braindeads that only look for T & A will not be disappointed, but for that reason alone you'll If you buy this on DVD, you will contribute to the company's downfall in your own way.
