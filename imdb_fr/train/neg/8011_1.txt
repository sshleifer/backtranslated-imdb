I really must have seen a different film from the rest of the commentators of this site because during the screening of the film last night, the audience was so mortified by the dialogue that (I'm not kidding) half came out. Filmed as if the filmmaker was thinking of approaching a bold new territory by presenting a narrative of homosexuality on the passage to adulthood, the film uses visuals inspired by David Lynch and roles inspired by Fassbinder. The performances of this film are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors would lose consciousness that the script did not seem to inspire them. What's worse is that it looks like an episode of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director thinks he is; perhaps he has surrealist pretensions like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the aforementioned directors display a level of scholarly sensitivity that is sorely lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this film about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces such as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this cinematic nightmare? There is nothing new to see here.
