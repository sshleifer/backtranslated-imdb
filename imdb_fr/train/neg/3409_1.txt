Rumor has it that when NASA's technical advisers for this film were asked to keep a credible image, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you're a politician or you work / crew the shuttle, you're not going to get into the shuttle. In addition, the cadet camp is in Alabama and not in Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar prizes before the events described in this film become possible. This film was intended for children and had to be written by only one because they did not know the myriad restrictions and requirements for access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most useless time, and it was a well deserved flop.
