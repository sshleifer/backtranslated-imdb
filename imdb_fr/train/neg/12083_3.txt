Yay! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a film without emotion. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. There are some stone pillars, stone seats, some stone crosses and stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this film is the fact that it's Hamlet, and Hamlet is a remarkably written literary work. The dubbing was not so bad though. The voices remained faithful to the dreary, gloomy, gloomy and dull atmosphere that reigned in life. I saw this version of Hamlet in the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of those three times, I was about to turn off the television, although it was 3K MST. <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
