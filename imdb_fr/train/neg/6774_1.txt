As a passionate fan of Cary Grant, I was expecting to watch this movie and scream with laughter, as AMC portrayed it as a comedy. I have never been so disappointed by a movie! The usual charm and effortless comedy of Cary are excluded from all this film; he appears to be tense, bored, but not himself. The Mississip character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, depending on which part of Mississippi he's from), and every time he delivers a line, he exceeds several decibels other cast member. Mississip has tried to stand out in the film as an adorable and witty swagger, but in the end he only manages to harm the already weak plot. Mansfield is more like an obscene inflatable doll than a Hollywood sex kitten. Although she has never been known in Hollywood for her talent as an actress, this film screams that she never had this ability. The character of Ray Walston was sweet and finally invented. For four men on shore leave, it was the most beautiful permission I have ever seen. I have watched this nightmare to the end, and although I do not spoil it for anyone, I will tell you that it is the most absurd you have ever seen. The film tries to generate patriotism and a feeling of debt towards the combatants, but the film is totally lacking because of its weak plot and its distribution. Sorry, Cary!
