As much as I do not like to say "me too" in response to other comments - it's quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with the endless chaos that includes the following 90 . <br /> <br /> Being banned somewhere does not make a movie lookable. The fact that it does not look like a Hollywood product does not make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse, in addition to no discernable plot (except that there are many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink a lot of vodka) a number of visuals are so nauseating that I'm in my second pack of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> Regarding the spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of thread I could not write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money, and do not confuse this with good Russian cinema.
