How has such a terrible scenario managed to attract this casting? It's ridiculous, predictable and absolutely incredible, it's well played and well directed, but the content is so bad that it's still one of the worst thrillers of all time I've seen in years . Amazingly bad, and not funny. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the casting.
