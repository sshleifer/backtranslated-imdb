This film is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies of all time. I can not even imagine that Gigli is worse than that. The glimpses made us say "NO", but we were looking for something in the middle of the sinking right now, we decided to try it. <br /> <br /> US STUPID. <br /> <br /> Affleck is not an actor. He is an image and may look good with explosions, but even the kind that Bruce Willis had in "Die Hard". If he undressed his shirt and ran to fight against villains, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she is always good. Gandolfini makes a new fall (if he had not had The Sopranos, he would have been washed), as he did in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck hangs up all the scenes and as others have already said - no character has any motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST.
