Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I try to see all his work. He has been known to save movies by himself with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget and its production values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for Christopher's sake .... avoid this movie!
