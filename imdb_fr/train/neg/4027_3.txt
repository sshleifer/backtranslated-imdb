It must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. His lack of subtlety and complexity and his total political correctness make him really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world just is not like that, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, and so on. However, what I hate most about this movie is the father of a friend of Bola. The director tries to give us a good lesson: Shaved tattoos are not always bad, in fact, they can be better than the average father (wow, it's like ... philosophy or something of the kind). Thank you, Achero. I will offer you for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
