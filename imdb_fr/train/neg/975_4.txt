I saw this director's "Woman On The Beach" and I did not understand the good reviews. This film is very similar to that, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest in anyone. Like its other films, you must want to listen to an empty dialogue, browse very few things and be enchanted by characters subscribed and beautifully uninteresting. If you feel like you like this movie, do not let my criticism stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I think Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior. He has a pretty formidable actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I do not like it. Never mind.
