Once again, Canadian television stands out and creates another program that will not be monitored after its first episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember, sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction. How is it fun to beat the stereotype of all whites by thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? OK maybe a joke just to stick to the masses. But not 30 minutes. This is called beating a dead horse. Even SNL would give up after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> In addition, let's have a little conflict between these scripts. Can she or not serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast of Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh it's Emmy win things here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! Which characters ?! These are all blanks of cardboard without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to another. This is the goal of the sitcom. We need strong, interesting and dynamic characters so that we are constantly attracted to the TV every week. We need to worry about these characters to worry about the problems they will encounter next week. If I never see these characters, it will be too soon. Fortunately, I do not remember any of their names (note to the CBC - it's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so bland. It's more of a casting problem than a comedian. None of these people actually embody the characters they play. They just seem to play their part as if they were working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe this character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the featured character. Look at any American sitcom and you will see how easily the characters are identifiable. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the actors seem to treat this project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things than instead of being their only and unique character for which they will pass the 8 coming years. This level of disinterest for the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, given the lame concept and the awful writing, there is not much to do for the actors, but to say their lines and try not to fall on furniture. As another speaker says, it sounds like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And the realization or the lack of realization! What can I say, Canada has so much talent? Watch what the comedy channel does with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Look at the Trailer Park Boys (not the movie because it bites the big dog with helium). Watch any American show to see the potential of our talent, because that's where many of our stars are looking for decent work. <br /> <br /> Give credit to CBC, she really knows how to advertise for a non-event. Do you remember "The One"? No, well, do not even try to learn the names of the characters in this series, because it will certainly go in the direction of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's all hope for a full ACTRA strike so that no such thing happens. emerges from Ceeb for a long time.
