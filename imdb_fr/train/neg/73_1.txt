It must be the worst bin I've known in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is an idol? He looked distorted. I would have liked to know that Naomi Watts and him are an integral part of real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she had seen in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is an idol? With his thin beard and fallow deer under the lights, I can not say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was as usual fabulous, but Geoffrey Rush looked like he could not wait to get off the board. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to have pity on bankers and murderers? It's far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually an entertaining film. It was banal, clich√© and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced that it would be better. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are locked up in a hotel on the border and women and children die because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they came out of the hotel with the armor, because we could only think about the black knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I was still waiting for them to say, "I'm going to bite your leg!" We were screaming with laughter, as were several other distorted members of the public. When we left, just about everyone was talking about the loss of time of this movie. <br /> <br /> I may not have paid cash to attend this disaster (preview), but it was certainly not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never come back.
