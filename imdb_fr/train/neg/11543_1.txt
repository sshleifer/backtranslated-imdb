Although I use this site frequently enough to see how other people judge what I think are difficult or enjoyable movies, after watching this "film" on Film Four last night, I felt compelled to write something thing, even though it helped me clean up again. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably the least profound experience I've ever experienced - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23 years old? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully like Leonard Nimoy Spock will not have any real substance about them - I do not know if the first half-hour of the movie was not decisive, but in a movie of revenge, you'd like some empathy with the victims ... here I do not care.In fact, the only character that is close to my heart is the dog, closely followed by the deer.And the two animals have surpassed Dire (sic) and Scully, who were frankly terrible I guess even if you're up to the scenario that was given to you, I'd like to thank the writers, the producers, the director and all the actors for wasting 90 minutes of my life and electricity of very good quality.
