The creativity of this film was lost from the beginning, when writers and directors left out a good story, to replace horrible special effects. This movie seemed to be focused on children's entertainment, but could not even accomplish that. Many small budget movies have the potential to become great movies, but this film is not close to that. Fortunately, it will be another easy film to make and forget. This film was probably a chance for the actors to earn some money until they have the chance to play a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has the slightest respect for movies should avoid seeing it at all costs.
