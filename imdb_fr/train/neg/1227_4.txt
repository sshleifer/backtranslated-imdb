Although many people here are praising this film, I must warn you. It does not make sense. I think Basinger plays his role as an actor, but you can not do a thriller if there is a lot of unreality. <br /> <br /> This scene presents a good image of the film: while Basinger pursued by murderous hooligans, she decides to sit down and look at a picture she finds in her pocket. The picture is from his daughter and he reads "we love you mom". Who does something like this? What is eff? And believe me when I say that it's not as stupid as other scenes from the movie. Someone said it was a "hidden gem". Well, I totally disagree, this movie has been hidden for a reason. And it's not a jewel. Oh, and I beg you, I do not even want to start talking about the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Usually, the lack of logic does not bother me except in small amounts, but this film is essentially made possible only because of the lack of logic. But, I still give her a 4 because even though she is embarrassingly logical, she has a certain mood that allows me to look to the end. <br /> <br /> So, if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned.
