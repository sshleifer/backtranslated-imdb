An incredibly thin, non-engaging plot, deep characterization / motivation, and a really ugly soundtrack (replacing tension with vast soundtracks, replacing arcane musical references from the original for digitized collisions and roars). then the specific references to the original In a world where Amerikan makes bitter and deadly remakes in memory of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (uncontrollable sobs) and Alfie desecrated our screens recently, This one take the proverbial biscuit, exaggerated absurdity How Ellen Burstyn never got involved is a marvel ... Waste.
