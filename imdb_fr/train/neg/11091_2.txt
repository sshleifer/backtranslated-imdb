Denzel is pretty much the only thing that's right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe there was once at an early stage a better movie. Someone decided to cut the action and plot at the beginning of the film, revealing the essence of the story in the first 5 minutes. This and ruin everything that the film could have accumulated in the previous rhythm and rhythm. <br /> <br /> So, first of all, it makes you confused, then it makes you feel uncomfortable. The dramatization goes beyond the suspension of the disbeliever. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the feeling of great injustice and anger that films like this one can potentially inculcate in viewers. Sure, it does, so if you're looking for that ... knock yourself out.
