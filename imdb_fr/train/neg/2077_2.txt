I needed an excuse to get out of the house while letting the paint dry - leave the movie after an hour to watch it dry. <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever going in a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The scenario was not up to the distribution and was just going bad - go! Uma Thurman does this kind of thing? Special effects quite lame. They were older characters and actors who lived in twenty exciting and exciting things - a kind of boring and inappropriate feeling. <br /> <br /> This review is based only on the first hour - it could have been improved. I just had to go home and see if the painting had dried up a darker shade than when it was gone.
