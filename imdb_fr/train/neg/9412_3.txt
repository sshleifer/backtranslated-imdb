This film was screened at the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival 2007. I did not expect the film to be chosen by anyone else. <br /> <br /> I like films that take a long time to develop, films that allow the characters to unfold and let the story go. The tranquility is good. But this movie was only very slow. <br /> <br /> The credit goes to the two main actors. There was a feeling of tension between them as two totally different people, unsuitable people, met each other very clumsily. There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the decor and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the intimacy of the film and reinforced the oddity of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand the end. What was the purpose of all this?
