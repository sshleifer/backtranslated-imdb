You know how sometimes you can watch a shitty movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well it was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because the price was $ 3.00 and I had heard it was a movie you could laugh at. It's really nothing pathetic. About 30 minutes after the movie started, my friends asked me to turn it off. About 45 minutes, they begged me. After an hour, we made a compromise to move quickly to the end, to see how the conflict was resolved (and because we're watching Matt Walsh from the beginning). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It's more than painful.
