Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project to come from Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, taking up his role on Broadway and winning the Oscar for Best Actor, embodies a German underground anti-Nazi leader fighting the fascists, dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in the United States (via the Mexican border). They settle in Washington with the mother and brother of the wife, although a resident resident in the mansion is immediately suspicious of newcomers and spends a lot of time at the German embassy playing poker. It seems like it takes forever before this drama concentrates, and when we realize what is the heart of the material (the wise, honest and straightforward refugees who teach mindless and headless Americans how the world has suddenly changed ), this seems a bit condescending - the viewer is literally put in the place of the family and receives classes. Lukas has several speeches in the third act that have undoubtedly earned him the Academy Award. Yet, for most of the photo, it seems to do little in and out, go in and out. Like his wife, Bette Davis states like no one else and exploits her big eyes, but this role does not allow her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are in turn humorous and boring, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role to play as a wife (and the annoyed texture she brings to the room seems totally wrong). The intention here was to show us tastefully, tactfully, simply because a man (from the Second World War) can be German, that does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We have it in the first minutes; The rest of this tasteful and delicate film is composed of exhibitions, defensive confrontations and ultimately compassion. It should be an intoxicating mix, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from ****
