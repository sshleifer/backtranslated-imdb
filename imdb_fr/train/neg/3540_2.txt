Guy Richie's third film (not to mention the dreaded movie "Swept Away" is a complex thriller about gambling, gangsters and chess ... fans of Richie's previous efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I do, with its twists. Richie, Jason Statham, plays the role of Jake, a recently released ex-inmate, to take revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (superbly named OTT Ray Liotta) of Outkast, rap group who sends us to him a number of red herrings throughout the film, which becomes extremely tedious.Revue is an imperfect work, not really horrible, but far from the best of Richie.It would still be Lock, Stock.If this film was a school homework, it would be noted 'must try harder!'
