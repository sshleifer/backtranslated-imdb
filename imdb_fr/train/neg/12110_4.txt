What is most striking in this semi-musical ensemble of the 1920s in Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing. This is the priority of First National in these ministries. The story is slightly engaging and resembles the intrigues of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where the hard-working girl is romanced by a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final hook. The four musical numbers are grouped at the beginning of the film and we will do a long time without more musical buoyancy. Miller sings parts of I Think of Baby and is recovering because of you. There is also NEVER BE BLUE AND IF YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST. <br /> <br /> Miller is very endearing and lovely, quite like Irene Dunne. Sad she does not dance because it's her forte. SALLY remains his best film, with this second and the poor SUNNY, a very inferior finalist. His life was tragically interrupted by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics prevented such tragedies. It is worth visiting these films to see the star of the twenties of Ziegfeld.
