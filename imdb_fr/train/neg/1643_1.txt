"Whipped" is one of the most terrible movies of all time. It's a nasty and hateful waste that forces me to stay at the theater more than any other 2000 movie, except maybe "The Grinch". As it has been called, it is not an insightful portrait of modern relations. It would be a little film called "High Fidelity". While this film was honest and friendly, "Whipped" is a hostile, cynical and misanthropic film poison. Avoid this as so many plagues unless you want to see how a "comedy" can be really bad.
