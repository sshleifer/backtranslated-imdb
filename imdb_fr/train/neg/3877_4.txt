I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I do not understand why it's become a "cult classic" when it's so boring. The opening scene looks promising, when the fat nurse drops the blood cartridge and runs for her life. After that, all that is really happening is the man who melts sneaks around woods and houses, while having a look back at his life as an astronaut. The makeup is pretty good and its melting and sticky face is pretty realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a man's head into a river and it floats to a waterfall where it falls on rocks and opens. There is not much to do to get wet, most scenes are shot in the dark and you can not really see what's going on. There is not much gore, at least in the Vipco DVD that I watched. <br /> <br /> No, the incredible Melting Man is not extraordinary at all. I'll give him some notes for his cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a true sci-fi / horror cult, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
