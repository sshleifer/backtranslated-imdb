Wow, it was a very bad movie ... as it was read in other reviews, this movie has no script, it does not have character development, it may have had some kind of script but it is difficult to say according to the final result. <br /> <The editing of this movie was really nonexistent, it tends to go from one scene to another without any connection or anything to help the viewer to determine what is really happening. <br /> <br /> All in all is simply a low-budget zombie movie that has not been thought of at all, has a bad action game, a bad dialogue, all that is bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this one or two movie is the gore factor, I think it must be where they spent all the money they had to try to justify their manufacture. <br /> <br /> Unless you are (like me) dedicated to researching and monitoring all the zombie movies you can find, do not watch this. Period.
