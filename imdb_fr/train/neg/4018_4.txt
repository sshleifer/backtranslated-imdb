This film is too skeletal. It's a low-budget movie (I hope!) That excuses him a bit, but the lack of a decent casting and an elaborate plot hurts him too much. Phillips is quite credible in his role as a torn son of a wealthy family looking for himself (although his family is ... well ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast is with straw. An excess of melodrama spoils every moment that has potential, and there are * many * too many subplots (which is a clear sign of parcel deficiency) nor is it an unconditional fan of Phillips, or who has absolutely * nothing * to do.
