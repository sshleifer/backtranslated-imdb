This movie makes me think that the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I saw in a movie claiming to be more than a movie "b". The comedy was so laughable that even the memories of Combs' past triumphs were not enough to save him. Given the scenario, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am deeply upset that I paid incredible prices for this junk. The fact that this film was designed for television would have helped me avoid this atrocity and, frankly, a film that this poor movie should be required to warn you. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
