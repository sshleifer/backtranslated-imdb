Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen as in a typical advertisement, we tend to lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I discovered an interesting fact in this movie: someone must paint high voltage electrical poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they would really like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored watching infomercials late at night and decided to watch this movie, I found Characters interesting and very appealing. <br /> <br /> I do not usually watch a lot of TV late at night. So I can not recommend this movie, unless you're looking at dry painting, your idea of ​​two exciting hours out of your life.
