I saw better quality of production on YouTube! I pity the actors because the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, not knowing how they could get out the lines - I really doubt that any actor could have saved this film, as good as it is. The characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot that seemed to go anywhere. It's a shame, because the premise of the film was good and with better quality of production, direction and script, it could have been a decent movie. It was certainly not a comedy, unless you laugh at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors seemed weird.
