I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. The acting game is the worst I've seen in a long time. Lighting and sound are at best poor quality. The plot has no meaning, even sober (ATTENTION: I do not advise to watch this film sober.) This film gives the impression that you are watching the film of someone who does not go out much. It is a shame that the very small budget spent on this project has been wasted. I can not wait to see if some of those who have been fascinated still have a career, apart from Eva Longoria who is the only star of this film. it was apparently not touched by the bad stick. I'm sorry that none of these reviews seems constructive, but I'll say something to James Cahill, do not try again. In the words of squirlyem "Its severely lacking in the good department".
