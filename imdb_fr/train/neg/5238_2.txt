I do not understand the positive comments made about this movie. It is cheap and naughty at all levels and I do not understand how it could be done. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound - the shameless and alcoholic father of Sue, the Irish father, is a prime example. None of the characters seem sympathetic from a distance - apart, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend, but even if he proves to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they are both, I do not know why either Rita and / or Sue would fall behind like Bob - but since they are, why should I worry about what do they arrive? So many critics continue to wonder if they are "realistic". If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to film it. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
