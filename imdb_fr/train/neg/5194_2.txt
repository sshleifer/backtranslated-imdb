Do not get me wrong, I want to see legalized marijuana as much as the next. I'm going away now. The writing, however, was unrealistic. A PTA mother who sells drugs but firmly holds that she falls into the hands of a minor. Leave me alone. The sufficiency of Mary Louise Parkers's pretty character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all friendly. Basically, the intrigues are not going anywhere. I understand his only television land. The hypocrisy was flagrant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a good mom and I'm supposed to believe that .... WHY ???? I just had the feeling of being preached by a show stinking of semen. It's like saying that it's okay to deceive your wife, but with someone of legal age. OK not exactly the same thing, but I think you understand what I mean. I guess saving children is great for election campaigns, but that does not fit into a cable sitcom that talks about a suburban mother, as a pot vendor.
