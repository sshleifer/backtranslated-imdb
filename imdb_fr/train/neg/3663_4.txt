The Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy plays in this film, one of his weakest werewolf films ... but support me for a moment. Most people will know it under the most popular television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and many home video versions have been released over the years. However, if you want to be serious about your projects, the most practical edition I've ever seen is called THE WOLF MAN NELE SLEEPS. It is a complete and unpublished European version that restores some disturbing scenes and contains the original naked clich√©s that do not appear in FURY's imprint. It is also in mailbox. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home after a trip to Tibet to discover that he has contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife had an affair. He takes care of her and her lover when in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy female doctor and her assistant. Apparently, the doctor tries to "tame" the werewolf and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and Daninsky, the hairy and fang who is in his trance, at least in its original version. In the end, we have two werewolves for the price of one, while Daninsky fights a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are rather inconsistent. When you look at the copy of THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, it's not as difficult to know what's going on, although editing is awful in places. Worst of all is the occasional unpaired sequences of the voracious werewolf of Naschy, taken directly from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "BLOODY TERROR" by FRANKENSTEIN) and mixed with it without any valid reason ! The wolf's garment changes from black shirt to white and vice versa, as does his behavior; One moment, the wolf sluggishly walks in a hypnotic trance of FURY, then grunts and runs wildly from BLOODY TERROR. Really weird.
