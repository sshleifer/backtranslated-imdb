As a person who has lived and still remembers very well this decade, if the 70s had been half as fun and (semi) normal, they would have been so much more enjoyable. The children of this time did not behave or behave The youth of the country was still under the influence of hippies and the culture of drugs all that the rebellion of the sixties had engendered, especially in the department of behavior; petulance, self-sufficiency, self-justice, childishness, the unreasonableness of them-none of the characters shows anything of that. <br /> <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Days", and I can see why: they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the present time, they were both broadcast, and they offer only superficial and clichéd representations of current epochs, which are not even close to its reach, but simply show the obvious things - fashions, toys, music, gear, and so on. and that's all. For those who are too young to remember or not born at the time, trust me, the 70s were not like that, nor was "Happy Days" like the 1950s, because "M * A * S * H ​​*" did not accurately portray life in a US Army military base Korean War, etc.
