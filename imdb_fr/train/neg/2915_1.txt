It's a bad movie, it seems like there are only 5 policemen in Hong Kong, they did not use their weapon and it makes me feel like a Jacky Chan movie. They used their weapon all the time to point only to the suspect. When they finally use their weapon, it's when they kill each other, what a fun movie. In the movie, it's as if all the good guys were dead for no reason. <br /> <br /> The narrative thread of the film is also nil, the story jumps here and there and people are bored. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think it's just a movie OK, I think the American zombie movie is bloodier than this one.
