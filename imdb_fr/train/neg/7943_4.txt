THE SEVENTH SIGN has a large opening hook as the Israeli Defense Force meets a terrorist base. This is the type of hook that is essential when writing a scenario; he grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon while he rents a room to Abby and Russell Quinnn he says he is. However, after the big premiere, I found the rest of the movie confusing and uncomplicated with a lot of holes and it's not that different from the many supernatural thrillers I've seen.
