This film is not only boring, it is also very badly done. The graphics are so bad that they are not even second-rate - they are awful. The characters show no facial expression, the dubbing is empty and soulless, and the plot is absolutely missing ... well ... anything and everything. My 5 year old son likes it, but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
