Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I could not find in this film any scary or frightening moment. Stupid moments? A lot. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? All over! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, it's not one of them. Oh, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheese. He is the most devious doctor I have ever seen. He has a man who melts in Ventura County somewhere, he is not very happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 kilos) and there is no cracker elsewhere. In addition, he has not very useful general who wants to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters thrown for good measure who meet the merged man. Finally, the film ends and the monsters come out in a bin to become compost. In the end, it's all you need for a good MST episode.
