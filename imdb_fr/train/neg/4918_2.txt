A rich guy from Harvard falls in love with a poor chick Radcliffe, to the dismay of his father so strict (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Syrup, sweet, and above all, sap story of a battle of "classes" when the kid Ryan O'Neal brings home the reinforcement of a librarian to ridicule his parents snobs. Ali MacGraw is the social abandoned to the dirty mouth while John Marley plays his fervent Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his groaning portrait as a Harvard champion. <br /> <br /> Followed 8 (!) Years later by 'Oliver's Story'.
