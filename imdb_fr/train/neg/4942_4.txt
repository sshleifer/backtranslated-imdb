Each new fall series deserves, at least, my "3 strikes and you are eliminated" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I actually said on television: "Canceled tomorrow". It was so bad. I have now watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and I have not yet succeeded, even a smirk. Not a title, a laugh, a chuckle, in fact, no movement of the face. I will continue to punish myself by watching each future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show. I just do not understand, but I think a comedy broadcast on a big primetime TV network just has to be funny. but there are no laughs from me yet. It's simply impossible for ABC to produce the least funny comedy of all time at 8:00 pm. I know there must be a joke inside that does not juggle with my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, I have "understood" the social aspect, but O WH ARE THE JOKES ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I am enlightened and I hit my head shouting "Eureka".
