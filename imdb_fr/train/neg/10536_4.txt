William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director / writer's credit for this entertaining, low-budget film about three boys camping in the woods with their horror magazines. The feet supported by fire and schoolchildren mock back and forth ... and a city tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface's glory) walks around and exchanges four stories of blood for the food and the heat of the fire. <br /> <br /> One of the stories is the old retreat of "The Hook", two teenagers in the path of the lover attacked by a mad killer with a hook for the hand. Another story has two or three players who need to score grass. They fall on a guy who knows a guy who has very good s # @ t. As they smoke a few full bags, their skin begins to turn gray and green before bubbling and falling. One of the best stories is about an unhappy man who returns home at Christmas, who can not wait for his mother's death and likes to talk to Satan Claus about his nephew and niece. The fourth campfire story is that of an avid sailor who worries about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out at sea by zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES includes. through and could have been much worse. A bit corny, but fun to look at maybe the sea tale. The acting is naturally not worthy of attribution. Members of the cast include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
