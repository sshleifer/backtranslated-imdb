* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am convinced that when it was published in 1958, it was much more appropriate for the time. At the time, movies were slower to allow the audience to follow and analyze the story. Here, a man settles in a house belonging to his last wife, mysteriously deceased with his new wife. The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) is really an underrated character. He receives a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she has problems, knowing that there was a criminal act in the death of the first wife. He can not tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with the skull. We also discover that Jenni saw her parents die, causing a lifetime of mental anguish that led to the institution. Like many spectators today, I found the pace a little too slow for my taste. But if you like slow-paced horror without a lot of gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
