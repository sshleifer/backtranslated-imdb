I know you've read this before on countless other movies, if you read the reviews here, but the voodoo academy is the worst movie I've ever seen. there is no doubt that the worst of them are not even available to be bought or watched on television, but I still think it's fair to say that I'm not just a stupid tenant who wrongly chosen. <br /> <br /> I've seen two-thirds of the last 100 movies listed here on imdb, and I'm counting on the remaining movies with every chance. most of them stand head and shoulders above this ... excersize in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to notice really bad movies (like in those without humor even in what state they are) by how many people you have to watch it with to do it all the way through. if you can look at it yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch it with one friend ... it's bad but it could be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> It took us 5 people to go to the end of the voodoo academy. and even the usually amusing moments of watching bad movies (locating the microphone, for example, 3 times in this one if I am not mistaken) could make me lose the dry taste of the mouth. yes, I had watched it, but I had also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we saw the directors cut ... to think that there could be a version with 20 minutes more big eyebrow horns with sebaceous glands in the oil of baby rubbing their torso, it scares me. Much of the film is centered around this. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decoteau for successfully filming this film in two days on a budget, just as I applaud him for convincing people to pay for what is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it's not a good movie. the original horror shop was shot at the same time for a comparable amount of money (taking into account inflation) and was a real gem. it is not an excuse for the gravity of this baby. <br /> <br /> The troublemakers to come ... <br /> <br /> it's not even worth it to separate the holes from the plot or to make a clich√©, know it all the heroes .. the rhythm of the film ... is crazy ... nothing ... is interesting for the time that Decoteau devotes to self massage pectoral. whatever your alignment or sex ... friction can not stand this kind of on-screen time. <br /> <br /> The acting game is cheese ... but not too much amatuer ... I've seen a lot worse in better movies ... but one way or another, c is really the semi-skilled cast of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a movie, which really make you squeak. <br /> <br /> praise him if, like me, you are fascinated with the worst of the worst, and only if you look at it with a group of people who are willing to work to overcome it. it is not ha ha ha the case has wavered together. it is an endurance test that you will probably want to ignore. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there is worse ... but I would not be surprised if it's called decoteau.
