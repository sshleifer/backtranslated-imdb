I try to be very objective when I watch a low budget movie. I also apply a lower weight to independent productions and low budget compared to large budget productions. I expect almost perfection of big budget productions and their studios. As a result, I apply stricter criteria to major versions of the studio. But this movie was just a failure. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was amazing as a high school student with an unwavering desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or in his acting that dragged you into his world. In addition, to make this film more mysterious, the lighting of some scenes did not create the atmosphere, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Again, another disappointing movie to which I could only give three points.
