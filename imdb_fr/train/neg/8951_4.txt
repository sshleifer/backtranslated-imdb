I am a big fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite author since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor that I really appreciate. When I heard that he was playing O'Brien, I was swayed. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer of the DVD first and some fears began to unfold, mainly with regard to the terrible "theme song", hearing the Eurythmics screaming mechanically "1984 " over and over again, an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The action as a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their part well and the tension within the ministry of Truth towards the end is felt, especially in the scene heartbreaking room 101. However, this is also where the movie is dropped. The film spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Julia and Julia Winston, which, frankly, is not what Orwell was talking about. He wrote about a painful future, about how Ingsoc built a man's beliefs and broke them all because he was made to love Big Brother. The film ignores what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons being reconciled with his role in life and the world and his re-education via O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The comment on IMDb for the moment declares that the film sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present during Winston's visit to O'Brien, they do not engage in the Goldstien fraternity and do not confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the first cases where Winston found the article with the Unpersons, but it is mentioned at the end. If you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario, that some excellent actor can not save. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the goal that Orwell was trying to assert, and the electronica soundtrack is downright terrible.
