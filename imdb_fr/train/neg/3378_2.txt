At the time of the release of this film, I had already seen Chorus Line on stage four times and was anxiously anticipating the production of a film of the story that had been much in the news. My wife and I were in the queue before the opening of the ticket office on the day of the film's release. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First, the story has been "moved out", so to speak, by including scenes that are not confined to the theater. These boundaries are a big part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and third set (set your own order): one of the original songs, with a very dynamic dance number, has been removed; a song that was NOT in the production of the scene was added. Can you repeat that please ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 2 star movie instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I have now seen Chorus Line on stage six times and I would not mind seeing him six more times before I die. It's beautifully written, with wonderful music and truly heart-wrenching stories. If you want to see a musical that includes excellent audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, watch it on stage.
