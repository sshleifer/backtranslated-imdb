I saw this film some time ago (while I was working on a trailer for the film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is at best mediocre, Hopkins records his performance (but still bluffs Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Believe me, you should avoid this movie as a plague if it ever goes out. It seems to last forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It's ruthless, the cinematography is of poor quality and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to shoot again. As for his acting, his character is totally implausible, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is quite funny and the surprising composition of the jury at the end of the film is cute, but this film is simply awful.
