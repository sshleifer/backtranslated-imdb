This first role of Barbara Shelley (her first in Great Britain after working in Italy) was created at the age of 24 and can certainly be said to have made an amazing start in "Cat Girl" in 1957 While the blondes and brunettes attract the most attention (I will always cherish Yutte Stensgaard), the ravishing auburn-haired actress with her deep voice still exudes intelligence and vulnerability (eg, "Village of the Damned"). "in his time on screen was much lower than the husband of his character, George Sanders). She is the only reason to see this dull update of "Cat People", and she is viewed with considerable advantage throughout (it's hard to say whether her beauty has regained her character apparently sleeping naked, and we're exposed to her naked and luscious back when she is awake (she is also exposed 8 years later in "Rasputin-The Mad Monk" from 1965) The beautiful dress she wears during the film is an amazing marvel strapless (I do not see what held this dress, but I would like to do it.) In short, positive evidence that Barbara Shelley, in a badly written role that would defeat most actresses, gets up over her material and makes the film still observable, a real test of the power of stars, she would find early enough in the studios of Hammer Bray, for the duration of the 1960s.
