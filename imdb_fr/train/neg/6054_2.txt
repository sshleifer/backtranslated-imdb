I'm not sure Carpenter is looking to ask about abortion and to make the very obvious and blatant point that a woman should be allowed to abort if Satan is the father, but things go on. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby is really stupid, it's actually a crab on which is fixed a baby's head. You can see the material on Satan's costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of boredom. Very very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge bloody and bloody tumult? NO! He just puts his head and mouth. Terrible.
