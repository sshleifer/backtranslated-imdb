It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact, I was expecting a bad movie but I was caught off guard, believe it or not. The scenario is traditional, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so badly written that you actually laugh when actors who are not half-down are trying to make it real. The photo is not very good, the music is so out of place that it really made me angry, the actors do not even try, even if the script makes it almost impossible to wait for more people who play since Thirty years and so-called action scenes really manage to miss "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these types of bad movies keep coming, who is funding this shit? Where is the projection? And why the hell do the actors take care of this impossible scenario? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood films in this genre without even aspiring to reach the theaters, but even Straight To Video films come to professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive except for the title that explains everything, I feel stripped of 2 hours of my life.
