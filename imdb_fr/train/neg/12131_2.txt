Kevin Spacey has a lot of talent, but unfortunately, directing is not his forte. I waited a lot for the movie before renting it and maybe that's why I liked it less. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a film that takes place mainly in a small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull, boring and extended. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done a lot better, especially since he is aware in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of his first films (I had a soft spot for the young and chubby of this Scream star). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the shooting of the wreckage of the car from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and beyond the wreckage. However, this plan was very "usual suspects" and I guess Spacey had the idea of ​​his previous movie (which is fine, do you think). If you want to see a fabulous movie unfolding in a small setting, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Spacey might have had to watch the movie before filming it.
