I totally agree with another reviewer who was delighted that "For The Birds" won the 2002 Academy Award for "Best Animated Short Film", and not this ill material, which is at best pretentious and which will please anyone, of course, who does not believe in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but the same goes for many animated shorts. And, by the way, I like black humor, but it was unattractive from the start. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, a guy walks around and is surrounded by gray (symbolism). a television (which appears a few hundred yards away) that it is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun in his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I guess it would be funny in two of the three cases.
