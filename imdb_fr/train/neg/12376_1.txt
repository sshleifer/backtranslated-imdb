This collection is really bad! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really like to fight. Man, it sucks! Quick and dramatic cuts, an extremely boring speaker, and the fights themselves have been heavily modified and shortened (I'm thinking in particular of Jet Li's fight in Fists of Legend and Jackie Chan's drunken master's fight 2) . > <br /> And what's wrong with these street brawlers ?! What's so cool about it? I saw more interesting fights on martial law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cups for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who have done this shit to do more! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy the movies where the fighting came from and live the battles in their uncut glory!
