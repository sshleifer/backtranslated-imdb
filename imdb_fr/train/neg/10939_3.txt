This movie has some of the worst actors I have ever seen! Some scenes are original such as nails that cross the ground. This nail trap catches these bad guys. The rest of the film is degraded as and when. I can not believe that this movie does not even appear in the last 100 films of all time. I can not believe that there are suites! The next crappy film I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than that? <br /> <br />
