Rarely has such an incredible cast been wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped on board, but were torpedoed by a scenario that seems like a Hollywood joke. To associate the name of Martin Scorsese with this was probably the draw, but the final result is well below the sum of its parts. Resembling a nightmare that went terribly wrong, each scene seems more artificial than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing but abstract, elegant and complacent absurdities, and the whole movie is decidedly dull .......... MERK
