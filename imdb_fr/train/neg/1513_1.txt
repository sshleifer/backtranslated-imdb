The flock is not really a movie. It's a dream movie, with dream actors. Not to mention Richard Gere, he made an excellent performance, but when one of the actors is really dedicated to his character and the rest of the cast is just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What did Claire Dains do in this one ?! She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the cases, it seemed out of place !! The only thing she did was ask stupid questions, like "do you really think so?", And make silly grimaces. I was embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and I liked her ... It's a type of romantic movie, I do not know who chose her from all the actresses ... LOL and see Avril Lavigne ?! it really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to feel like throwing up, this movie will do the work for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
