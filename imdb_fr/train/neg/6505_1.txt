A confused disorder from beginning to end. As they used to say about the Beatles'songs, there was a secret message if you played the LP upside down. If you had the patience to watch these movie scenes from end to end, you would come back with the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Apart from all this psychedelic chaos that mixes flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were those who supported the film, ready to take revenge if the film was not sorted . There was nothing to love about these two either. Overacting, screams and threats were delivered in the comic. I think a dimension was an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Okay, so maybe the artistic guys roll their eyes, delighted that unlike them, the plebeians just did not understand it. Well, I'm afraid there's nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad film made from beginning to end. A non-existent and pathetic story if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, no character you care less about.
