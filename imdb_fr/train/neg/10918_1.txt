Manmohan Desai made funny but illogical movies like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made falls like COOLIE and MARD, then GJS <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst movies ever made by him , the dial became famous Mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad that you grit your teeth <br /> <br /> The British are made of caricatures and the film looks so weird The scene in the British hotel is damn stupid <br /> <br /> the movie has a lot of stupidities like Amrita attacking Amitabh, then the whole scene and the climax, the movie gets even worse There are more gems like a horse statue coming to life, Amitabh haha ​​masks and more <br /> <br /> Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad Music goes well <br /> <br /> Amitabh plays his role with style, nothing differs COOLIE, roles like LAAWARIS Amrita Singh goes well Satyen Kapuu goes well Prem Chopra is as usual , Nirupa Roy is still as usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
