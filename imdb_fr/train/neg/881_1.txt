Thanks to an infamous domestic video distributor who introduced the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not only horrible but really horrible. So horrible that I threw it at the used-goods store to get more money. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who reached an agreement regarding sex only on Tuesday because of their busy schedule. profession. Eva and Luis are a day-to-day living couple where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly makes Eva lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair in the back of Eva and Nick. Luis has deceived Eva into lying to him that he will fly to London to do something in connection with his works of art, but the fact is that he flew to Venice with Charlotte for holidays for adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and took his two children to Venice to confront each other. The trip to Venice ends up falling for Nick and Eva. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of comedy. This not only looks insane, but also draggy. In the movie, Nick tries to ask for help in several ways, but it does not work. It is either the aliens who act around him who act like idiots, or they are simply idiots. <br /> <br /> The comedy also tended to add useless scenes to prolong the story. Although some problems can be resolved with common sense, no one in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big trick to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> The failure is so serious that even the beautiful landscapes of Venice fail to make the film known.
