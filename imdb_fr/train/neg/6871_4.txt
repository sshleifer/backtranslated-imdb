A good concept that went wrong. Bad acting, even worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, I wondered why it had made the season two. The characters are forgettable, the writing is mediocre, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - we've done so much better in the same amount of time - where is the money going on this one? The first episode begins with being interesting, then decreases rapidly - the precept of the whole show is ridiculous. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of science fiction and a "geek" - but this show just is not enough. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised that season 2 was won: so much better was canceled after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.
