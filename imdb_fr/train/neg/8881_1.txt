The character plays a little stiff, as if it was the first time a man of the actors was on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (who played many roles on TV, like Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and afterwards, his game can be missed. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr. Ballard, as described by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to wear this film with his body language for most of the time. It does not do a bad job, but it's a bit excessive to ask an actor to plug in the oceans of white screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and NOT playing. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (with Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for his money. Then, the woman seems to come back and haunt the husband who drives him crazy until he jumps from a high window (fearing the specter of his deceased wife approaching him) the day it is planned that he do not die less. <br /> <br /> The second driver hired by Mr. Ballard is a lot like English brand Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is total disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, no one speaks and few act. It's a shame that the guys from MST3K have never managed to get this movie. It could have been much better, if not just as predictable, with more dialogue or shorter scenes of "nothingness". <br /> <br /> I always expected G'Mork's red eyes to appear in shadow and proclaim that he works for the "nothing" that lives in this movie.
