I was so disturbed by the real pictures of the beginning of the film that I felt bellyache and that I ended up closing the film. How can we give this film more than a note of 1 disconcerts me? I know that the purpose of the film is to shock, but to show real pictures of a live skinned dog (retaining the vomit as I type) - please! I turned it off after the scene with the decaying baby. I had my eyes covered most of the time until that point. No wonder this movie was found in HMV's bargain box. I really do not want to see another movie of this person from Uwe. Anyone who has enjoyed this needs a therapy. Period.
