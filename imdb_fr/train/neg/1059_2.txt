I watched this movie last night and I can not remember it. The story is about a group of criminals escaping from a penal colony. They fly to the moon in a space-age garbage carrier; there, they terrorize the garbage workers working on the lunar base. <br /> <br /> It is striking that low-budget science-fiction films are often garbage that involve desert planets or, like this film, criminals fleeing prison colonies. Why I do not have any idea But I can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical. This one is really no exception. It starts reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a dancing half-way soundtrack of dance music. He then degenerates into a boring thriller of science fiction. There are so few consequences in this movie that I struggle literally to write a useful review. Therefore, if you read this, I apologize for not being able to enlighten you on the subtleties and nuances of the film. For the record, I remember a group of tedious villains, a group of tedious goodies, nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Apart from that, I fight. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you might be interested in the activities of the lunar trash men, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
