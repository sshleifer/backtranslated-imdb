Hideous, frightful, frightful. <br /> <br /> A condescending remark at the beginning and some bad autopsy photos do not make a good movie. Once again, I am amazed by the determination and talent of some people in making a film. Yet, they do not have the pride to realize that what they have made is a pile of shit. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a redemptive element so I could at least balance my critics, but the only thing I could think of was that Pink's opening title was rather good ... I wonder if she has ever seen that? <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk, boredom can kill you.
