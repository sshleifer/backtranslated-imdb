Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven rubbish. Eleven minutes each of ennui, sophism, condescension, complacency. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt giving a "Hip Hip Hooray!" for terrorism in its amateur segment. On the other side of the green line, Amos Gitai (Israel) uses his eleven minutes to show off a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newspaper presenter. Mexico's Alejandro González Iñárritu focused on the twin towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn unaware that there was no building in the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan is ignorant of everything. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial and clichy love story. Ken Loach from the UK focusing on Chile. Etc.
