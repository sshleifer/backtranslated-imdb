William Russ is the main character of this TV movie. He left his family behind him to reappear and start paying his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. This is where Peter Falk (Colombo) intervenes, playing several roles, to convince him to go home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they managed to find a former star (Peter Falk) to a fairly good degree. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems that his game is always correct. <br /> <br /> I found the story and story very tacky in the way everything was predictable. In fact, I could almost dictate word for word the last 20 minutes before that happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a sub-normal movie. In a letter order system, he would receive a "D".
