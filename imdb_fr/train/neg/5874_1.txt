one of the worst movies I've seen so far. Pathetic action scene and very bad game does not help either. The only good point is the roles of Gary Busey, but it does not raise much the film. he is at the height of his ranking in the movie B and passes the test brilliantly. A waste of my money although I found it entertaining at first, it's annoying after a few watches. I do not recommend this movie unless you watch it for free or it's a gift. (a gift that you can ask for the receipt and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
