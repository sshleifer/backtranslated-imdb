OK, how's it going for the original - this old, wicked and rich geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all ungrateful losers, and two scary servants, provided they spend the week in his old sinister home. What happens that night will only surprise those who have never seen a movie or TV show. After a series of murders in which the victims seem to bleed ketchup into a restaurant, we find ourselves with a painful twist. The cast is run by once respectable actors, who must have been desperate for their salary. There were also some second-level actors who rose up at the time but who have been forgotten for a long time. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "Matlock". I'll give credit to his place - the closing scene is smart and fun, if you're still awake.
