First of all, I really liked Henry Fool, which put me in a very small pool of moviegoers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was a real parody. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the movie in the extras - so full of pride and baseless analogies with Star Wars - hurt the stomach. It was a hype on the part producers (HDNET) carried out to the maximum. A real example of the emperor and his new clothes. I especially think that Hal ruined HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I'll ever be able to see him again under pure and innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember, Hal, you can FIRE some people sometimes ... etc. today, if he was just dumping garbage without meaning. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson taught in the movie ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, otherwise his box office hopes are actually dull. It does not matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to play in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The score, I think Hartley's, has no taste. With drum strikes walking everywhere in the dialogue. I discovered an Apple Soundtrack loop that made me smile. When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they are just trying to conquer a new audience. But it's really that ridiculous ride. I would be happy to ruin this movie for you, but it's already done. This is rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
