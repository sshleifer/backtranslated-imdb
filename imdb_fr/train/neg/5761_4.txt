Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers used something other than oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you are not aware of the latest stupid pop culture, then you will miss most of the ridiculous humor of this movie. Why waste your time? You can sit on a newspaper doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will give you. <br /> <br />
