I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings' Nightmares and Dreamscapes miniseries; which means, I have seen 6 episodes so far. I must say that the stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of his stories that was published a long time ago. I remember most of the stories were average to mediocre, but there was one that was really excellent, if not remarkable. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that just because this mini-series is from a collection of Stephen King's stories does not mean it will be good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories suggests, most of these mini-series will be rather mediocre. <br /> <br /> For the defense of Stephen King, I did not read this news. Maybe they're good as stories in a book and they're not easily adaptable to television, or maybe it's the writers' fault of writing an interesting storyline. Who knows. In addition, this news may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not for printed reasons. Maybe that was the problem. If Stephen King had submitted these shitty stories to a publisher, I'm sure the publisher would have immediately asked him to make it more interesting because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> it's because the problem comes from the stories / scenario and not the actors and actresses, because this mini-series has excellent personalities. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series makes me really appreciate these old "Twilight Zone" "series.Each series only lasted half an hour, but it was fascinating and captivating.I do not understand why this mini series could not accomplish the same feat, I'm sure this miniseries had a lot of money to make a good one but unfortunately, there was no click. <br /> <br /> By example, this week, two episodes were shown, the first involving a horror writer who buys an image drawn by an artist who committed suicide.The writer begins to notice changes in the image as he returns At home, feeling uncomfortable, he throws the paint but continues to appear near him, and the portrait of an individual in this image kills people and tries to kill him (I will not mention not even this week's second episode about criminals and their booty because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting and the story should be good, but after seeing In fact, I was frustrated because the story included too many gaps, as well as hidden elements that have not been revealed and do not help the story. After the last scene, I had more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for three weeks to participate in this mini-series, but the situation was too painful because of the stories and scenario poor. If it was a film, I would have recommended people to wait for the film to be broadcast by cable or whatever. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However, since it is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say that if you have not seen it before, try it for a week. If you do not like that week, you will not like past series or future series, because they all share the same annoying feature.
