This subject deserves a script and a final result much better than the ones this film offers. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather as a succession of nightmarish scenarios. The gaps and the tips in the story are numerous. The scene where the victim of the kidnapping is told that her parents are not dead and looking for her since she was caught is just strange. This is a moment of cathartic therapy, the head of the runaway shelter giving him a "missing poster" dating from his eight years. In the real world, if the head of a runaway shelter found out that he had had a solemn abduction under his roof, what would have followed would have been an immediate appeal to the police. It's a law enforcement problem, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so brief that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were spent on a free operation. It's funny, that's what this movie is supposed to condemn. In the end, he seems to have joined the group.
