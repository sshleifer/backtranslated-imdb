The thematic genre of cinema since its inception is that genre which involves attractive women whose artifices and means attract sensitive men not only in their arms, but also in disastrous circumstances that will usually only threaten the male victims, with uncertainty as to whether or not. not the temptresses will be forced to take their drugs, and here Susan Lucci plays like a mermaid, although his acting skills from a soap opera-themed soap opera are insufficient to make his performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), the inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a trifle for her, but a matter of heart for Richard, apparently hypnotized by his lover as she takes advantage of his ardor to engage in a risky conspiracy that will lead to a project of murderous intent. When Davis is convinced that Guileful is the victim of physical abuse by her husband, he desperately tries to free her from what he considers to be a marital trap in order to marry her, believing that the only clear solution his fate lies in a rudimentary attempt to hire a professional assassin who will get rid of Stewart, allegedly violent. As a result of the criminal's assault on Collins, two police detectives, executed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become more and more curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while the reality begins to delight Richard, delighted, who could have paid a price in exchange for maneuvers his inamorata. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly considered as a pair of viable conspirators, each giving a reading that makes it a boring set rather than a charming one, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a disordered scenario direction and elements non-inventive design. Published on a DVD of Fremantle, this largely unglamorous affair featuring a seduced man enjoys a first class visual and sound quality. Although no additional functionality is provided, the above-average production quality reinforces the cinematographer's efforts. Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
