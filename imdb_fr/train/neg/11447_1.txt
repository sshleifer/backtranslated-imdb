Probably the worst movie I have ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people who laughed at the theater were tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I like idiotic and silly movies, as much as the next girl, but the principle, the writing and the humor are bad. It seemed to me that they were targeting a "Napoleon Dynamite" sensation - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it ended up being forced, clumsy and strange. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt absolutely awful that she (and Sissy Spacek) signed up for this horrible thing. <Br/> <br /> Thank you so I did not pay for it.
