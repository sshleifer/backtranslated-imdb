When I looked at Wrestlemania's game map this year, I was so happy and unable to control myself because I was so excited. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, pissed off because I wanted to get my money back. I mean, you look at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will remain like a classic, then you expect the same thing and you get the average trash that they have from time to time. The only moment in the show that ruined everything for me is when HBK started playing! This exact moment when HBK lost to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a loser / poser. Wrestlemania 22 nearly messed me up when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after watching Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it (thankfully). I have faith in the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I have ever seen), which was a pure classic of Wrestlemania. This certainly made up for 'Mania' 23 and also gave us a lot of memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you have watched any of the Wrestlemanias before this one, like those who make you fans (Wrestlemania 20 shot me in a fan), PLEASE, do not look at it and make the same mistake I made and leave the WWE behind. And if you look at it and are angry, start over and look at Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
