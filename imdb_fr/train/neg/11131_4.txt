First of all, I agree with a little that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His interesting and concrete counter-proof proves this man a hit with the university circus. He falls on friendly, unpretentious, pragmatic. It does not adapt to the current political style (unpleasant bi-partisanship) and it aims at the extreme left as well as the extreme right, punishing both and for a good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is a failure. In fact, I would not even call it a documentary, but rather a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without Pause" is no different than watching a speaker on a recorded segment of 3 am on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no changes, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no story. <br /> <br /> Technically, the production is strictly amateur. The sound is terrible and incoherent. Sometimes we can not hear Noam speak, other times we can not hear the questions posed by those present. When Noam seldom speaks, we are allowed to see the reactions of the audience, except when we quickly see his wife who apparently attends each of her speeches and radiates pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film and would say that you would probably do better to watch his speeches recorded on cassette or CD to listen to them in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a good mood today.
