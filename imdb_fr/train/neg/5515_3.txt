There is a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, luxuriously colorful and full of well-crafted art deco details. The animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time, which are undoubtedly higher than those of today. However, I find it tedious for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: It certainly does not live up to Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although it is probably supposed to evoke a setting of "Great Gatsby", it ends up being sad, sleepy, repetitive AND monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same, as testifies the 5th symphony of Beethoven). Since most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes when they are yawning, there are many visual elements of the cartoon that will miss the average viewer. <br /> <br /> The scenario: I'm not giving secrets that are not already in the summary of the plot - good country, bad city. This is a recurring theme in both animated and living films of this era. It is a misplaced nostalgia for an inexistent rural idyll, which is reflected today in a similar nostalgia for "values" that never existed.
