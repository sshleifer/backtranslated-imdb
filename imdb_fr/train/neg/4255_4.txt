The film begins with a beautiful lady wearing a ragged white dress that crosses a stereotypical Eastern European city. we know that she is followed by something because she continues to look behind her. and soon we see that she is pursued by a mysterious man in a black trench coat. then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and that he is looking for it. but look at his reflection in the shop window ??? no it's just his identical vampire! but unfortunately, they get it both. <br /> <br /> after this brilliant and surprisingly amusing return to the old 60's and 70's hammer movies (in the credits, the twins are cited as twins of evil, which is of course the name of the last slice from the trilogy of the hammer karnstein), the plot dies almost. <br /> <br /> The little conspiracy involved involves dracula (which changes conveniently every time he is reborn, the producer does not do it) I do not need to re-employ the same dracula ) arriving at the morgue, medical students realizing that he was undead and thinking ... wow what an opportunity, maybe I will not pay attention to all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood is transforming you into vampire and use the vampire's blood to find a cure for our astonishing friend's illness. Obviously, it's a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept but which has gone terribly wrong. The film continues to create wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students are trying to revive Drac by placing him in a tub filled with blood in an isolated and degraded Manor House. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film, but are we staying there? not because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned pool. sigh. This film has a real problem with the "tributes" as I mentioned before the opening scene was completely hammered, and this homemade scene would have been perfect for a movie resembling a hammer, but the film quickly switches to a medical horror <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they introduce so many characters that it is almost impossible to feel sorry for one of them. There are medical students and their "friend" of the teacher type related to the wheelchair. Medical students are all arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. The way they went to medical school surprised me, unless the medical school had to respect its muscular / busty limits. and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie. Hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not mount it like the movie would say. then you have priests, cops, and random scientific types so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten until they need that person to save the day or to make a fright not expensive that it quickly becomes tedious . <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a lazy movie. no real fears, just some predictable fears. The setting up for these is so elaborate that it is hilarious. for example, the tub full of blood. it is so obvious that drac will come out of the cloudy blood. and yet, we must wait far too long to arrive at the fear of the inevitable leap. after that, he kills one of the most stupid and broad-bred medical students. we all know that she will become one of the undead. but what are others doing? bury it in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, so you know who's going to jump on you when the cops come home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will understand that it is impossible to make a dreadful movie about a vampire and that we opt for the atmosphere, then we will end up with a complete movie that is worth the opening scene. <br /> <br />
