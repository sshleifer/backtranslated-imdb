Probably the worst New Zealand film ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes They are not funny. Used in other movies and just silly The acting is bad even though there is an excellent distribution <br /> <br /> The story is boring and uninteresting Has more cheese than amateur pizza huts Pizza cheeses a bit like the actors Was done 1,000 times ago <br /> <br /> I watched it when it was on TV, but I was so boring that I could only stay 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is void <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, <br /> <br /> Look at the paint to dry instead
