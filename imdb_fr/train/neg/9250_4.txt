Disappointing and predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from one state to another because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, in the genre "Everywhere except here", have helped to better understand the relationship mother / daughter. With Better acting too.
