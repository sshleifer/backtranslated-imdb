This episode of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Dr. Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about rhythm and decent and plausible dialogue. There have been times when I literally screamed on television for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he's creating a suspense, but Carpenter must reduce this too simplified and simplified partition of his (or that of his son) and move the action a little bit. How many times has the girl said, "Oh no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, no, it's coming"? Carpenter takes much better film elements (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here as if we were supposed to recognize and appreciate his style. What's missing here is a real suspense and energy. It is as if he is wandering in the process of making a movie. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to the tried-and-tested classics - The Thing, Halloween and They Live. To better control the horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House.
