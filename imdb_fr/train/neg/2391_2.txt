I like movies. I like independent efforts and big studio productions. I like movies with stars and those with strangers. I like dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, all genres except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I like good movies and even bad ones, because almost all movies are full of entertainment and entertainment. With the exception of "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I attended a night performance of "Cowgirls", I joined an audience of about 10 people. Less than half, I stayed alone. Soon, I could not even tolerate the disturbing disorder that was unfolding before my eyes and I left too. To this day, "Cowgirls" remains the only movie I have ever released. <br /> <br /> I do not really know how to describe this incoherent film, empty, trash, meaningless, or how to describe it well. lack of cash value. Suffice to say that this is one of the worst major movies of all time, absurd and inexcusable at all levels. He tries to be smart, but his conception of feminism seems desperately anachronistic. He tries to be funny, but his humor is rude and within easy reach. This is one of the few films that profane its own philosophy by portraying the protagonists so disconcertingly that you rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, look at "Waterworld", "Ishtar", something else. Except the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and that, read a book instead.
