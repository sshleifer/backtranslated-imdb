1st seen 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): A complete remake of the horror movies supposed of the 70s as Friday 13 (versions 1 to anything ??). I can not think of much redemption here except (or can I think of anything?) ?? The story revolves around a group of stupid people listening to a radio show a year after children were killed in the woods as a "tribute" to that, supposedly. But now, one of the stupid people has ties to the event in question because her sister was one of the people murdered (again, what stupidity would she even be part of it). Guess what? The murderer is aware again and we are informed from the beginning who it is (so it's mysterious). And next to all that, where are the "cops" and why does not anyone call them. I can not believe that this film was financed by someone and made. One might think that now the American people would be judged a little higher, at least in their filming experience, but this is not the case for this filmmaker.
