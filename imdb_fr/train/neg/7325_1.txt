This makes Hollyoak's actors look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is shocking and appalling. Turning off the DVD player was not enough. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them. I will never find this time again. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal film, boring and soulless? I could not think of a plan of action that would relieve boredom. Writing the ten lines required is incredibly difficult for such a shameful movie. What more can you say than to repeat how much the acting is really horrible. Please avoid.
