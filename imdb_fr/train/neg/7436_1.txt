This film is a waste of time and money. For an hour and a half, I kept waiting for it to get better and it never happened. It was a slow movement, the plot jumped, it was not scary or interesting, and it never really came to anything. The opening credits were long and long, which was basically the same as the rest of the movie (long and stretched). Many parts of the plot did not make sense. Several times during the film, I thought that I may have "zoned" because of the incongruity of the plot, however, my companion had the same problem and assured me that I did not "go out" of boredom, but it was the movie. In fact, I have never posted a movie on a movie before and have been actively researching IMDb movies for many years. So, the fact that I take the time to write something should say a lot about the seriousness of this film and the fact that you should not waste your time or money.
