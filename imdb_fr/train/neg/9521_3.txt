This movie has been played a lot lately during the day, whether on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it to the captain Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see him is the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say that Matt was more than a little long to play a high school student. If he were a woman, they would have made him play the mother of a high school student! (Is it just me, or does his daughter start to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Highjinx typical teenager played by adults.
