It's not really a terrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are leading actors. In addition, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Moreover, I do not understand why these actors and the team made the film, they are professionals and they are paid for the film. But I really wonder why studios spend time and money making a movie and then not distributing it to the theater audience. Even if a film is a box office fiasco, it surely brings in money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or watch it on TV, just like I. Of course, the film will not solve the problem of immigration with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard. Today's TV rate.
