This is the worst sequel to the world of movies. Once again it has not been since. The killer always kills for pleasure. But this time, he kills people who make a film about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the most stupid movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. If you value the precious time of this movie, do not look at it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you for success. Because it does not combine the original marks of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not let your children watch this movie. Teenager, young child or young adult, this film has an impact on people.
