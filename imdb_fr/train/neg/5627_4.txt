Looking at this movie, it's interesting to see how much he marginalizes black men. The film spends its time showing how far the most visible black man is powerless (except for a heroic moment). For most of the movie, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the movie are very much in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and compassionate. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with it. There are also quite visible and three-dimensional support characters with fair skin, and warm and dignified white characters. But 99% of the black men in this film are only invisible men. Shadows without voice in the background, without consequence. Such a horrible defect, but anything but unusual in mainstream media.
