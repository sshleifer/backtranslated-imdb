Sorry, this movie did not scare me, it just annoyed me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and it all went down the drain. Children! The father! The premonition! There was so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I heard everything before. Scary! No! I can scare myself alone, here where I sit, only in the movie. Are there any men writing this figure that women should be so boring? Huh? This film was rather atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / scriptwriter had taken the trouble to work. We could have had good music that would have added to the tension if someone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they have this money? Give it to me and save everything that bothers you. Abandoned? ... No we were betrayed
