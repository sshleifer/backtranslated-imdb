I saw this movie on tv this afternoon and I do not see how anyone could sit in this trash. It's not funny at all and it takes your I.Q. a few notches. I know this film is for children, but that does not mean that screenwriters should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers were sitting around a big wooden table and thought that a) The word "poo" was like a big laugh. b) A four-foot child can dive on a ten-foot basketball net. c) The children should always fight against the kidnappers armed with pistols, because they will fall under the weight of everything. d) 3 months of karate training are enough to beat the "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the world's weakest suburban "gang", which can not scare anyone. Maybe the guys from MST3K could use this movie to laugh. Do not bother with this lame excuse for a movie.
