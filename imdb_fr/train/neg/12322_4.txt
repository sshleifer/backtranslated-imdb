As seems to be the essence of these comments, the film has an amazing animation (I watched it on Blu-ray) but it really lacks depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters are all pretty. dull. I had a hint of some sort of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main Shunack antagonist. However, my mind was perhaps wandering and it was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favorite animated, the original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really adorable either and, as mentioned in another post, they fall exceptionally in love quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she likes Agito, who seems unaware of that). However, she seems to quickly forgive Toola in the end, without any explanation for the change of heart, except that it makes the ending a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. Who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the strange women / girls who seem to spend time with them and manage the forest? Nothing explains why they are there and how they can give super powers to ordinary humans. The plants from the moon still do not fill the whites on it. It almost looks like a strange version of Triffid Day. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? why bother with that if it can not be explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie but I found the plot not as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having no real character like those of Miyazaki. I do not want to watch it, but I really wish I did not buy it. My advice? Try it if you have a few hours to spare, but borrow it or buy it cheaply! Maybe if your new animated movie starts and you do not have much to do, you'll enjoy it. It's visually pleasing.
