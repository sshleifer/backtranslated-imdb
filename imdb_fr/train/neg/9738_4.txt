Not so bad because it is credited with being (Hooper is much worse) ?? more so disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, that Hooper never really exploits with his economic direction and even less in the smoky writing (excuse the play on words). It is so sinister and overflowing with a grave and serious tone, becoming ridiculous and fuzzy, letting the whole pessimistic / conspiratorial narrative be easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt. Because of this, the pace remains rather slow and Brad Dourif (cool to see him play a leading role) seems to have a hard time getting an unbalanced performance, despite the reduction of a strangely strange intensity of his offbeat character. Even if it is done at a lower cost, there is a competent technical attitude. However, she does not seem out of the ordinary with her idea and wants rather to plaster in unpleasant jolts (some of which work) and striking special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper displays elegantly frenetic images (especially towards the last end), the work of the camera is quickly manipulated and the radiant score is titillating. The performances are everywhere in the shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have fun little cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but rather exciting.
