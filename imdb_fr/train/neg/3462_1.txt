Slash movies are coming in now, so when I heard about Cut, I had high hopes and heard good things about it. These good things I heard were all wrong ... very wrong! This film is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. All about it. Especially the origin of the killer and how he stays alive and how he is cared for in the end. This film is not original or exceptional. Just another aspiring slasher with these "Hip", "self-conscious". Characters "scholars". I'm so sick of this shit. Someone is doing something else because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
