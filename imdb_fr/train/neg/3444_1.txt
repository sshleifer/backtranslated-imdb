This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. From the plot, although the plans, the "special effects", the acting game, and did I mention the plot? Every thing in her ass sucked! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "doing too much" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this film tried to do; it was supposed to be one of those films we do not really know what's going on until the end. You are sitting, fascinated, not knowing who died and who is alive and who killed who and why and when you think you understood the timeline, you find out that you are wrong and that the film ends - leaving you the open mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "Work" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this junk, yes, Olga ?? The writer, the director, the producer, the scriptwriter, the founder, the decorator, the artistic director, the costume designer and also a double for one of the characters, it's scenes ... it's a film of a only woman and when it comes to Olga Levens "Levens Productions", you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> This could shock you, but "this time", Olga did this great trip jumping from stage to stage, from dream to reality ... but wait! it was a dream after all ... or was it ??? The picture fades and I realize that none of this has ever happened, the girl was all alone on the ship ... in fact, there was no ship ... no waiting! There is the boat again and the guys! They are alive! Thank God! No, they call him to join the cruise ... but after the boat disappears then maybe they are dead after all ??? or maybe they were never alive to start ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I just said, you may like this movie - otherwise it's a boring job and the only reason I put all this shit is how they can finish this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at it if you like time, 90 minutes are a waste of time in this case ...
