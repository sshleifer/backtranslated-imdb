Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking that it would be pure pleasure without mercy. That's what it is, without the pleasure. This movie is really stupid, it is absent from any plot, any development of character or any kind of scenario. The basic problem with this movie is death and gore. Basically, every kill is exactly the same. ZOmbies ripping someone. Yeah, it's good, but you also need to kill some players. I mean, it was getting really bad, every murder was exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love gore, and the gore of this movie brought me nothing. It was just boring. No scenario, just the same lame scene again and again with a different person. I also wanted to love this movie. I love to shoot video gore movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not fool myself. This film has good points, but none of them are in the film. I understand that a lot of "zombies" were involved in the flood and that there were more than a hundred zombies, which is pretty cool to see how so many people were involved and helped. But overall, it's a terrible movie.
