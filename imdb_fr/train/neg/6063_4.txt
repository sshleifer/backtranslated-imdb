"Masters of Horror" proved to be a poor arena for "episodes of messages" and, although one could reasonably argue in favor of Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most of the effort to do so seemed heavy as an anvil and unimpressive (nothing defuses the horror more than a soapbox). And "Pro-Life" simply merges reactionary views and ultra-violence. The young Angélique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running in the woods, is almost hit by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who have just arrived by car to go to the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angélique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a far-right saint who will do anything to prevent his daughter from having an abortion. If nothing else, "Pro-Life" has generated excitement for its controversial topic, but John Carpenter treats all of this business with surprising indifference - he seems even less interested in making a film than the script himself (who is certainly poor); the slow pace does not create tension and simply brings the plot already difficult to explore. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, the flaming guns, it's a breathtaking event. later, when a doctor is tortured with a "male abortion," the scene is considered gratuitous and unnecessary - an effort to smother the film subscribed. The bad performances (Perlman is unfortunately ruined here) become a consequence of the scenario and Carpenter's instructions are exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" was the source of his next hot meal. At the moment when a human-headed spider-creature and a man dressed in a latex monster suit lurk in the corridors, one has only to wonder what those responsible for this mess were thinking ...
