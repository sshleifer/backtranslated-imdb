If it's someone's favorite movie, he needs some serious help. This crapfest is not funny or clever. I have not seen the original movie, it's the remake of (some movies of the 1950s), but it must simply be better than this new bastard. <br /> <br /> A commander gets fired from the army to be a marginal element, and ends up teaching children at a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans ... children are thus immersed in a world of boredom without humor. Can Wayans put these losers back into shape? Can they make him become a little more human? The movie bomb as most Wayans movies do, with only a few sparkling moments. William Hickey spends about a minute on the screen, not enough. This charming old man (best known to me as an actor of "Tales from the Crypt", better known to you as Uncle Louis of "Christmas Vacation") shines every moment he is on screen, which is not so terrible here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which suits him perfectly. Bam Bam would not bother me a bit more, but I think he was playing the role of "biker" as far as possible for a military film. <br /> <br /> And then there is the seductive professor, who Someone falls for Major Payne even if he treats children badly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone one with whom you would like to spend time. She must be incredibly stupid or desperate. I do not know which one (although it may sound "stupid" since the movie clearly says that it comes out of the house quite often). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a brilliant moment: a dance sequence where he plays a series of movements (including a very good "robot"), and with the help of the music of 2 Live Crew. This scene was nice but did not make up for what made the movie spit. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie about a loser helping his kids become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he's an adorable loser, and actually funny. Maybe if Major Payne had fought the badger, I would feel better, but he did not do it. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do so much better.
