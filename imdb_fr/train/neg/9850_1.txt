I felt dead brain, I will tell you. This is the worst movie I have ever bought. (In my ignorance, I thought it was Peter Jackson's movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look awful. The scenario promotes this kind of TV movie, looks in the middle of the stage. The actors seem to take lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have a look each and stick to that. Plus, I was never confused by a movie before sitting down to watch that. The fact that it is a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in minutes. Avoid like a plague.
