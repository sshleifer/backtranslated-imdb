This mishmash of a novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the greatest American writers) gives The MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS works of art by Fellini. Raquel Welch, with an amazing body (and actually she is not very big) in a lead role (with the exception of KANSAS CITY BOMBER while she was pretty good) playing the role of Rex Reed (bad review) movie, not critical), to be surrounded by drag queen (awesome chick) Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and "naïve" Farrah Fawcett (before the Majors; what a shame), and other various creepy azoids for pretend to usurp the truth so that things do not go well for that, except the old inter-spliced ​​clips (eg Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... JUST so they can continue to bleed life from everyone. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Best performance = ?. It's so bad that it's worth the trip!
