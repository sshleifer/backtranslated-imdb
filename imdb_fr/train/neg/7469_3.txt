The screenplay for this soap opera is so unbearable that even at one point or another, A. Hopkins had to play like a drama student to bring his character to life without a screenplay. I do not know if it was the goal of the director, but Hopkins' Cian felt nothing but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. Maybe the real Ciano was all that, but why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing and his long run was closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was downright ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), whereas she must have been the central character of this so-called family drama. Watch it only if you like the Venezuelan soap opera.
