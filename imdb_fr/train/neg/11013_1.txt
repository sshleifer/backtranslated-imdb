I'm in bad movies but it has nothing to do. Despite what the morons above said, it's NOT funny. I know comedy AND underground movies, but it's so boring that the director / screenwriter should be banned from directing NEVER other than local cable access! To love films and comedy is to despise this film. I will never understand how boring and boring this job was. If you like this movie you are a pothead as sober as there is nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the beginning of John Waters. The film begins by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me satire. The rule for comedy is this: if it's funny, you can say or do anything but if it's not funny, you're not satirical, you're not pissed off, you're just pathetic and this movie is just not funny. ZERO!
