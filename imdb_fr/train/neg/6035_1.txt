I really wish I could give a negative vote on this question because I think I just lost 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror film ever on film. the acting game was just awful, I mean really, really bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written by ... I can not think of anything awful to say. And the day "outside" and the night "inside" make you think that the events lasted several days. Terribly played, directed, written, etc., etc. until tasting, how to lunch for everyone. Stay away from it at all costs. If my only hello to staying out of hell is doing a good deed is telling the world not to look at that shit. This film is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
