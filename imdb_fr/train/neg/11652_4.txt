The script of "Scary Movie 2" was just not ready. This is a glaring problem with the film, both for the actors and for the audience. The director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are funny people; and so the film is not completely humorless. To their credit, the film has many fun moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even as smart and fun as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a funny movie. He transformed the smallest subtleties of the genre of slasher film into comic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy as it is original. They miss even obvious opportunities of parody. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210", and it was a show that needed to be parodied! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is like a good open bottle of wine too early. The script needed a lot more time to age. 2 out of 5 stars.
