The summary of the IMDb plot in no way describes the essence of this film. He should have read 'Prepare to be catapulted into the 3rd Thornbath prison at the back of your family's church at the age of 8, listening to the preacher speak of God's will then that all you can think of is to go home to your Lego. <br /> <br /> It starts well-intentioned, building the plot by sowing real and surreal clues like Renny's: "How did my sore thumb heal so fast?" moment. He then slowly transforms into a Christian jamboree, completely sacrificing his plot in a labyrinth of babbling induced by evangelism. I think I counted the use of the word "pray" about 53 times in five minutes, towards the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word into its synonym of "prey". Unfortunately, this little mental game made the movie bearable for at least the last 20 minutes. In addition, it made me laugh each time a character said "prayer" ("preyer" for me) because it became totally crazy. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sank into her chair of boredom, to the point of finishing on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all the salivating Christians who rated this film between 8 and 10 stars, I suggest they stay your security standards reinforcing theology such as Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar, etc. Stay away from more cerebrally difficult subjects in movies such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Was Not There, What would he want to buy, or the next forthcoming book, Religulous. <br /> <br /> Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
