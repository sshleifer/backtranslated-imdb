A group of Fox TV executives sitting around a conference table are wondering what new show to order. <br /> <br /> "Why not aim for something like the 24th or the west wing?" said one of them, but they all agree that it would cost too much, and that cheap television is less likely to hurt the chain if it collapses. <br /> <br /> "Well, why not bring together great comedy writers and make a quality sitcom?" offers another and is shot on the spot. "You do not know that good writers cost a lot of money!" the great chief is barking. "That's why we invented reality TV." <br /> <br /> "We could do another police drama ..." suggests a man in a bland suit. "I'm listening ..." responds the boss, suddenly interested. "People like CSI, let's make another copy," adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> "But there are already too many CSI clones, what can we do to stand out?" a naive junior informs himself and is sacked instantly. 'Sticking Out! If we do that, people can be confused! Give them more of what they already love! the great chief shouts. <br /> <br /> "Let's simply add more violence and make it really appalling, we're the Fox, after all," suggests another suit, in response to a cordial response from the leader. "We could make the unit of deviant crimes," he adds, clearly on a roll. <br /> <br /> "By Jupiter, he has it!" the big boss laughs, "and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who carry very little on the screen". "Well, it would certainly distract people from the middle scenario and poor scenarios," Blandman points out. <br /> <br /> "Then it's settled, we just need a name," announces the grand chief. "Could we call it Sex Cops Violence? <br /> <br /> "Too literal, how about Killer Instinct?" It conveys violence, but sounds a bit like the basic instinct that has had a lot of sex. <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the Grand Chief replies, then they hit each other on the back and cancel the arrested development.
