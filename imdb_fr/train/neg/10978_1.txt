Usually, when a film receives a vote, it is simply because someone likes it less and is upset because it does not have a low note and so decides to reduce it as much that he can instead of giving it a low note. That is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. He does not do anything and he does not have the chance to do it because he does not really try to do anything. There are aspects of a bad kind of D & D conspiracy that does not hold and a complete lack of actors. It is clear that no one in the project has made a serious effort, because even the hard work of totally talented people would amount to doing more. A really awful movie.
