The question, when you see such a bad film, is not necessarily: "How did such a bad film come about?" or even, "Why did I see this horrible in the first place?" but "What did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - It's not because the "rules" of horror movies have been cataloged and satirized countless times in the last ten years that someone One will not make a film that uses ALL, without humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie needs to be described as ** loosely ** depending on the video game, you have scripting problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character still knows kung fu. <br /> <br /> - Although you can be proud of what you have learned to make the matrix "effect" on a budget, it does not necessarily mean that you should use it again and again ad nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee role of choice. <br /> <br /> - When a scene does not come together, use video game excerpts, no one will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap-metal band proposes to write the theme of your movie for free and politely refuse. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not a Fight people by killing zombies. It's about zombies killing people, preferably in the most macabre way possible. That's what makes them fearful. <br /> <br /> - Whites who can shell out $ 1,600 to get a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, he'll tell you. everything you need to know. Something else you will understand about your own lines after someone asks, "What was it?" or "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Topless breasts are not a panacea for horror movies. <br /> <br /> - A shot of the arrow of a helicopter and a license agreement with Sega transform your movie magically "student film" to "major studio release". Try it! <br /> <br /> - It's not because you can name the three "Living Dead" movies that you become George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I saw worse movies, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
