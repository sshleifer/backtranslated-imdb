This movie was terrible. I gave him the highest score of 2 because I saw worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the shot to have the end of the film at the beginning and go back to the beginning at the end this film used all that was needed in the box of mischief used in the making of films for the pleasure of seeing him, like a kid with too many toys. There was endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged pictures, and so on. - none of these made a dull movie better. <br /> <br /> This is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little alcohol or alcoholism and no representation of withdrawal with the film jumping everywhere without consistent meaning . The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious. The staging was just as bad and it's unfortunate that people have spent more money buying more movies from Mr. Jobson, previously known to be in a garbage group and on television, which is all makes sense. the film does. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to see this all the way, but in the hope that it would be better, I went bitter, but it was really a waste of time and I It would have been better not to disturb.
