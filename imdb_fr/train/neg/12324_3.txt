It was a scam of the same garbage that we had to watch animator Bob Saget during the past half hour. Dave Coulier just thought he was funny and that it was pretty much the same show as the Funniest Home Videos of the United States, except for one host who has a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must have really needed this money and Coulier had to go to the trash for his jokes. It was already a sufficient torture to see him imitate Popeye and other failed comics start at Full House. This guy who played all the jokes to everyone deserves to receive one of the recipients of a Grade A wedgie. Coulier must have needed money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
