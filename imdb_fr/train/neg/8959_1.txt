Some people might consider this film as a work of art - to be able to express one's imagination on film in order to create a film filled with antagonistic pain and death .. I personally think that this film is a disgust that should never have been published. This film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a total waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The awful images shown in the film do not just make you feel the air, but they lurk in your mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people are wasting their imagination in the face of such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, its meaning, its climax and its resolution ...
