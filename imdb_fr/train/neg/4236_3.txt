Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a little modern psycho-billy, then seeing the gigs is the only thing to watch. This film has tons and tons of group cameos, with Troma's president, Lloyd Kaufman in a semi-major role, and a lot of wacky death scenes. Looks like it can be good, right? Well, the dead continue to arrive, and many times to many Warp Tour groups and fans of the event. Some of the deaths start in style, but they are then recycled several times, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies of having their head broken or having their intestines pulled out. The gore seems to come from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; with this being the "diluted guy type", but now this movie is actually decent and provides some humor - something that is terribly missing from this movie. Of course, the film was directed by Doug Sakmann of Troma, he has a very good potential for a small budget and he tries ... but too hard. Everything is too much to be funny in this film, and that's what makes it fall. Everything is trying to be too comical and clumsy, by acting intentionally wrongly, by abusing unnecessary deaths and by doing the same thing over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board" or any other film you made with your friends: it's funny for those who did it, and it's almost everything. <br /> <br /> potential, good idea, good use of effects, but it's the same thing ... again and again: a group plays, a group dies, the fans die. Everyone dies, the blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is what are these types of films, which is basically the "bad stick", do they try too much, or not at all?
