I attended the preselection of this film and was shocked to see how old it was. It was a combination of all the horror / thriller clich√©s, trying to comment on a lot of things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, cops in plainclothes, business, religion ... and it was a mess. the acting was pretty washboard; the boy and the guy of Jesus were fine, but outside of them ... Anyway. I admire the efforts (even if they failed slightly) to try to show the Christian people in a different way ... even if they did, the way he presented the gospel was a little shady and fictional. But again, he may have to talk to a little kid ... no. In fact, I decided that everything was bad. music ... oh my god ... horrible ... too dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for the people who made this film at the premiere; It seemed like a poor student project. I'm going to stop talking now, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life with shit. Here.
