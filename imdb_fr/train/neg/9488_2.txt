I saw horror movies that were very terrible in my day, and although it's not the worst of the group, it's certainly in the lower half. The script starts OK. A young doctor goes to the hospital as an intern, hoping that this will allow him to find a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The film then goes straight to the bathroom when you realize something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that gathers people's souls. It is incumbent on a doctor, a nurse and a security guard of the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs to perform a ritual which consists essentially of cutting off his tongue and then allowing the haunted house accessory of a demon come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheese special effects. At this point, the movie becomes so ridiculously stupid that I begged him to finish. There was still an hour left. It looked like a half-hour episode of "Tales of the Crypt" that sort of stretched out in an hour and a half of feasting. From Tiny Lister doing her best imitation of John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins playing the role of stereotypical nurse Nurse Ratchet, this film fails at all levels. I gave these 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) Her fianc√© is very hot, she has a little appeased the pain towards the end and 2) The film looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with high quality cameras from Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this shit even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do and I always felt cheated). As a bonus, you copy with your friends whenever Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be drunk 15 minutes in the movie.
