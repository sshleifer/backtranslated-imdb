This show was ridiculously bad. The writing was nil, the dialogue was nil. The guy who played Craig could not get out of a paper bag. Since it was Thursday night, it was really great to watch with a few beers. Cool music, bad acting, mediocre writing, everything came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a dramatic / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to one of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, because they could not tell who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue around that, which was terrible. I mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that took place in the present were completely horrible. <br /> <br /> So, let's go over. Everything that happens in the present time is nil. The flashback scenes, only Craig's writing, dialogue, and acting were dead. The music has reigned however.
