Here's another Diane Lane film where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time it's 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse. I'm not so surprised because it's so predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the slag too. I would not be surprised if she was also sleeping with the ice cream man because it's a very boring movie. Then, after throwing milk, she apologizes and sees the man in a blouse. Duh. Then, while making it with him, his son is stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at a nest of wasps. This mother of children did not have time to tell him that, she was too busy with the blouse.
