This film is bad! They took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse! This movie was so terrible that I wanted to go home and hold my DVDs "Dukes" and cry in a corner. The casting was terrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass who drove a car. When was Boss Hogg mean? When was Rosco a tough guy? They have never been! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke pot? He never did! Now, do not get me wrong, I am very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it did not belong in this movie! The only good thing about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits. It was a waste of time, money and air. To avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
