Scary Movie 2 is without doubt the worst of the 4 movies, because there is not much intrigue, bad acting, rather boring and some really lame jokes. But. And it's a big but, there is a good actor, a good joke and a good start. The good actor being Tim Curry, the only good recurring joke is the scary and strange butler with a disgusting hand that is still making cuffs but laughing at worthy things. And the good start is the parody of Excorsist. <br /> <br /> The plot of Scary Movie 2 is composed of the main characters of the original and a host of new characters are invited to spend the night in a scary place. old mansion, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you're bored, you might as well watch it!
