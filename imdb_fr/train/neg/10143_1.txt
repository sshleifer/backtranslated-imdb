FLIGHT OF FURY takes the torch to be Steven Seagal's WORST movie I've never seen ... until now. <br /> <br /> It's a dreaded boredom without interesting action scenes, Seagal is not He really tries - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more. <br /> <br /> The co-stars do not fare better, being a rather disappointing group of 3rd raters. <br /> <br /> The management of Keusch is very poor and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another pair of Seaink (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script co-written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to 12 million IMDb dollars were spent for this boring old tosh load - If these figures are correct, I feel that a big fiscal violin has not been spent. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is in fact a perfect remake of the movie Michael Dudikoff BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this tripe. <br /> <br /> This has NO quality that redeems, Give it a MISS! 1/2 * on *****
