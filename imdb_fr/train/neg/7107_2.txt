I'm sure there is some sort of IMDB sect that likes movies that MST3K has made fun of. After seeing both this and "Werewolf" and read dozens of comments about their degree of underestimation, I became convinced that there is some confusion happening here. Many people say that those who hate him "are only scared of the gore", "I do not know what horror is" or things like that. Well, I do not care about Gore, but I want something to happen in a movie! Most of that is just the woman sitting and looking around! Or take a walk in the house / garden! A movie requires something to give it atmosphere, you do not get it by just useless scenes where someone walks around and looks. Oh, and "it makes you think"? Yeah, I thought "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> P.s. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style Dracula, Frankenstein, that sort of thing.
