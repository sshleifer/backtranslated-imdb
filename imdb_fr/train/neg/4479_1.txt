I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies of all time. If not, then it's VERY close. Never seen a bad soap opera for teens. Well, it's like one of those. Except worse. For example: girl (probably possible): I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> guy: all we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to take me to another place. <guy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... In doing so, they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you have NEVER read the book, avoid this film like the plague. They completely change the personality of the characters and events. Moreover, they get rid of everything. In addition, the film ends around the end of the book. It's an AWFUL movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you have read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teen soap operas inferior to your average low-grade teen drama, go for it. Again, should we expect something different from MTV?
