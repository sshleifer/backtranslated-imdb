Terrible! Absolutely horrible! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera and then the whole team went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to give this video, but no one will take it. I give him a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'm going to have to greet this one. <br /> <br />
