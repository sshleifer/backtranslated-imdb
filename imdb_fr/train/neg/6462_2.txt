This miserable movie shows that even some of Gollywood's best products can not save a real dump depot. <br /> <br /> I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was wrong about this effort, but it would take more time. I have already lost 91 minutes to watch ... IT. <br /> <br /> Looking at this now, after Brando's death, shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors was. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill more lines for this to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. Goodbye.
