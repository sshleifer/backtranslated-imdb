Critics have spoken to death when, honestly, it is not so terrible. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, with pending variations. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was a little fast, a bit like the silly movie "Swordfish". The reason why this film is more popular is that it came out in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast all over the world in film festivals and foreign theaters, but it has not yet found in the United Kingdom and in the United States <br /> <br /> It is true that this film pays tribute to many classic films like DOG DAY APTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that does not not to say that it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Look at her if nothing is on T.V., but you will probably be bored after a while.
