If the team behind "Zombie Chronicles" has already read this, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a movie like "Twist Ending", it's not a good idea to insert Close-ups of EVERY DEATH OF DEATH IN THE FILM in the opening credits. This tends to spoil the twists, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you've produced this at a reasonable price and - to be fair - you've worked miracles with your budget, but hire people who can really do it. Or at least walking, talking and gesturing at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to put a part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have accessories and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. The torsion terminations are supposed to be a surprise. Of course, we do not want twists that make no sense, but rather to indicate the "unveil" as soon as you introduce a character? It's not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the guys who tried, but in all honesty, I would prefer they did not ... <br /> <br /> Only for full players.
