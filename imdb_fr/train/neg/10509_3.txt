Out of the sky, a band of naked and excited female angels (with big plastic fangs) settled in a sinister forest where she feeds on unhappy souls that should wander. Shortly after, a group of friends on a road trip is a victim of bloodthirsty girls ?? Forest of the Damned is an independent, low-budget horror made in the UK. She takes an interesting premise and throws it to the ground with some of the worst acting games, effects and directions I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows an occasional flair behind the camera ?? The scenes in the dilapidated house are quite tense and there are moments of shock skillfully manipulated, but the film is mostly technically amateurish. Add really horrendous images of horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson and you have a very bad movie in your hands. <br /> <br /> A little fun can come from the poor quality of the movie, and there's female nudity for the guys to savor, but most will find it a chore to sit down.
