I will not waste my time writing much further on the fact that every aspect of this movie is indescribably bad. This has already been done in great detail, many times. The "plot" began as a very wide cockney foe and an uninspiring gangster-by-number and very quickly descended into a total mess. Anyone who claims to be able to see a hidden masterpiece inside this horrible mess makes fun of themselves. It's been 7 or 8 years since I watched her during her week at the cinema before releasing her, but I do not mind thinking that this is without a doubt the most terrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making these comments, and the only reason I went to see the movie is because of the funny fact that my brother Eddie appeared there as the second "heavy" from the pub scene. It was his hands that pushed a zippo lighter into Rhys Ifan's face in the "Russia" bar (he was actually filmed in the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no experience as a comedian - he just joined an extras agency and it was his first part. After seeing the film, it became apparent that no one in this film needed any theatrical experience. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and it was only a few days after it was released. . I have never heard of another film so unpopular and so quickly gone - and rightly so. If you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I'd rather put your two-pound pieces in a fire until they're hot, then push them into your orbits. It will probably be a lot less painful than watching the movie.
