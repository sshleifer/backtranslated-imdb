Oh my God! Rarely has a movie "horror" bothered me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. After an enthusiastic start with an intriguing premise, there is little more than a slasher movie, with some supernatural and sexual aspects. Alice Krige, generally excellent, is lost in this one and the twists of the plot are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you are really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
