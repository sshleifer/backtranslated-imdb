I know that slashers are always supposed to be bad, but hey, it's like a 10-year-old band was saving up their money for lunch and starting filming it at the end of their week. <br /> <Anyway, six young people all go to the same house to get killed on the screen.We have the smart, the slut, the other slut, the black, the killer, stereotypes like that.After one is eaten Shaking the boat, all the others are harassed by a guy wearing a mask, the people of the poor box are rejected. There is a fairly decent murder somewhere in the middle, but he is back even more bored and especially more false fears. we know that it can not be the murderer when a person is attacked, because the guy loves to take all his time to do everything. <br /> <br /> After the death of each character you hoped to die, the naughty blond villain and his future boyfriend ends up being captured by the killer (they are like, pushed down and then faint ) and the killer turns out .I think the writers of this movie have taken a bandeau, a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters. The mobile is just lame and does not even throw me on the accursed secret.The murderer of course takes the way too much time to explain everything (then about ten more minutes in which he cuts his arm for some reason) and eventually let himself be dominated by an armed man.He, not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. I could have more fun watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear. I mean, most of the 80s slashers also shook, but at least they added T & A. nothing goes for that.
