I watched it with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What's this mess? We do not have it at all. I may be wrong, but a chair has something to do with the death of this woman's father. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who like a good thriller. Bad thriller! * shakes the cane to the film * I will never see him again. And I'm also a big fan of movies for life! They need to stop making movies off the books. It makes me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly and yet she loves him more than Hugh, who was a little prettier. : 1/10
