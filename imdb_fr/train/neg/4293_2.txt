"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - is one of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main actors. Even they can not save this completely finished melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is terribly ill prepared like a shy girl. Despite her genius as an actress, she can not even do that. She is too strong to be credible as a simpleton and too old for the role. Lancaster on acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is far too martel and looks more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the always-reliable Wendell Corey seem to go beyond casting - but even they can only do a lot. Looks like in the 1950s, Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a little bit as an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them), she did not do much. Despite a distribution of A-list and good production values, it does not work.
