Come on Tina Fey, you can do better than that. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Of course it was funny sometimes. Even laugh aloud funny. But there is not enough laughter to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At most I recommend to rent it but that's it. Baby Mama presents fun scenes, but is predictable and does not have the comforting end to which she aspires. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher are a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have both done good things in this area. But that's not the best. Baby Mama had an excellent cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin contribute to the splendor of the casts. <br /> <br /> Another film about pregnancy hit the world of cinema. After the big Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very mean compared. Knocked Up and Juno are hilarious, comforting and have endings that leave you smiling. The end of Baby Mama was dull and dull. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and she is not trying to be one. I recommend it but do not expect it to be totally hilarious. Expect an average comedy that does not give the great emotional end it is trying to have. I give baby mom ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
