This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm pretty surprised that in this story, Pilate wants to finish Jesus, while the scriptures (and the other films) say differently. There is also a very important question missing: the resurrection. None of the other films neglects this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians resides in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith is vain." A very impressive scene for me in this film was seeing in the streets the remains of palm trees used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and unlike my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was not a myth. And in fact, he was also a Jew. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say, God has become a man) who have truly transformed humanity. I urge him (since he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
