What an insult to the film industry SA! I saw better SA movies. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, saying that it's worth a tenth of a tenth, are pretty scary. The rating of a movie should not depend on .., "OH, A FILM FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY." STRENGTHEN ITS INDUSTRY BY TALKING ABOUT THEIR WORK, EVEN IF IT'S BAD. " We have the expertise to make good movies. Do not judge the film industry about what people say about how much they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell beautiful stories such as Cry the Darling Country and Shaka Zulu. Shout the beloved country, I will give 9 out of 10. Excellent staging by Darryl, great for two big old actors, wherever they are. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 in 10. It can only be people involved in the project that would give him high scores. I would have done the same thing if it was my film.
