<br /> <br /> What's left of planet Earth is populated by some poor and hungry survivors. They must eat insects and insects, or whatever, after a war of poisoning or something like that has almost wiped out all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth who can comfortably live, we will call him the Big Boss who knows everything, has a great quest to prevent the spread of some secret spore seeds in the air. It seems that the Grand Patronal who knows is the last person on Earth to know that these spores even exist. Spores are located far from any living soul and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The big boss who knows everything wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. He therefore plans to send a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all the protection systems and the secret location. Sending people to the secret spore site does not make them secret anymore. By sending people to disable all protection systems, the spores can be easily released into the air. Why not leave the dogs asleep ?! <br /> <br /> The only pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is Vivian Wu, radiant and elegant. While the macho action team members, remarkable, give up with predictable timing at a mechanical pace, Vivian Wu's charm makes the conspiracy that her former employer so desired. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Vivian Wu's fans may want to see an exceptional film B that she's been in for two years, called DINNER. RUSH. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
