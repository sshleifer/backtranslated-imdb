Misleading Advertising ... I saw an advertisement for Carlitos Way: "Producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way" LET GET IT STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, he was actually "assistant to the room Editing for Scarface Do not take away Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have a little more class I think I can speak on behalf of the masses when I say ... We hate to have been lied so As for the film, it was poor at best, I thought Puff Daddy did a good job, but Luis Guzman should be ashamed to have worked on this film. Carlito's Way is well filled in. It's obvious that this project was an attempt to make money rather than a good movie.
