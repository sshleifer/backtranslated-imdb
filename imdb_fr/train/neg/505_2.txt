Wow-this one is bad. I will summarize as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> A count invites 4 naive sluts to his castle. A pile of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and non-erotic soft-core sex scenes occur. Some girls have their heads cut (in the background) - The End. <br /> <br /> Only decorations and decent costumes, as well as a bad dubbing resulting in fun and unintentional dialogues, and some brief nudie shots. And believe me, these things are not enough to buy the 90 minutes of boredom that this film represents. In fact, the best part is the point of departure of the distributor who presents greyhound goth chicks covered with blood and showing their tits, and again, this is certainly not worth the entry price for this waste. As everyone has noted, the film's title makes absolutely no sense, as there is absolutely no blood sweat or dance in the film. It could also be called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk' - and at least he would have had a better title that does not apply to anything in the movie. An exact title would have been '90 minutes of torture ', another seductive title that would have been at least truthful ... for the viewer. Honestly, the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" extremely flexibly ...), so I strongly suggest you look rather if you're still curious. I can not imagine anyone loving this wreck of a movie. Follow my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
