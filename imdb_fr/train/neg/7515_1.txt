Questions. That's all I have to say about this excuse for a movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell did they think? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make another movie. The acting was so bad that he did not even manage to entertain at a bad level. The attempt to "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This film is bad! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard about a sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> We <br /> <br /> All
