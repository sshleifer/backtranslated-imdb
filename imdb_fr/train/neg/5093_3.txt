I just visited the Russian forum of our TV channel that showed this movie. Well ... 99% of the active Russian public is disappointed. We wanted to see more real facts of our space achievements in this film. But the authors thought of something else ... :( We are a big and beautiful country populated by intelligent people.We are proud of all our dreams of space, real achievements on the one hand in this field and the science of the other, so I would like to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD, and where, hell, is our MIR station? Ah, I'm sure the LUNOHOD events took place much earlier than the Moon Walk. of Armstrong and scientific errors - I really do not have the time and space here!
