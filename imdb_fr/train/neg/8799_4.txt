Congratulations to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room watching the role of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and I wonder how many people, other than classic movie buffs, know something about it. He has been a giant in the sector for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have earned him two consecutive wins, as he had already won for playing against Louis Pasteur the year before. My personal opinion is that, although he has tended to react too much, I still think he was one of the big players in the Golden Age. Whatever role he played; <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I found that this story smelled a little too much what we have seen in the past 60 years: go to the sea to make a liberal. hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its disdain for the police or the army, but here, it is time to tell us how much these organizations are "corrupt". Filmmakers love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film is ahead of its time since we have witnessed this event since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It should be noted however that the facts corroborate this story. This does not diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer, eliminating some of the ills. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time there than focusing on one test.
