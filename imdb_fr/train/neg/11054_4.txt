I find it very comforting and inspiring that the Hollywood filmmaking team like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK begins his career with a low-budget horror film like this one. Perhaps to showcase the talent that would have earned Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but unfortunately becomes frustrating precisely because he fails to muster the cinematic prowess necessary to succeed. . <br /> <br /> The place involves a girl who goes to a small coastal town in search of her father painter, who has been missing for a while. The fragmented narrative soon abandons all hope and plunges headlong into an incoherent absurdity - and for a moment it works so well that you begin to think that the Messiah of Evil may have to be recovered from the winding throat Exploitation of the 70s as an example of mysterious and clever horror. <br /> <br /> Surrealist non-sequiturs keep piling up as the girl stumbles over a young couple in a shabby hotel room that's in town to search for the locality's legendary Blood Moon, "a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father but who would have been found dead in a little alleyway later, the blind old lady, owner of the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all the paintings of her father from the shop and finally a retarded albino, murderer and squirrel eater. <br /> <Part of the film's charm is precisely that sound of an artistic surrealist market that defies logic and gender conventions at every stage. While with Lynch, this is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil, the border between the "intentional", the "unintentional" and the "not really expecting her to is manifested this way, but it's good enough - WRAP SCENE 'blur without hope. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the double narration that enters and leaves the image in a way steeped in drugs, fever, flow of consciousness, the one that comes from the girl while she walks away looking for her father, and the other narrated through her father's voice as she reads her diary. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about a "dead living" image, Messiah of Evil is different and is hardly one - at least with the current misconceptions about what a movie zombie is supposed to be. The origin of the undead here is a 100-year-old curse inflicted on the city by a mysterious "Dark Stranger" who came out of the woods one day. Meanwhile, Hyuck finds the time to make bits and pieces of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that precedes DAWN OF THE DEAD for many years (you can already hear the MST3K line: "The man is dead, only his capitalist food "I have left") and a similar scene well thought out but poorly executed in a movie theater. <br /> <br /> I generally think that the surreal works in careful doses and well dosed "How absurd is it to work if it is not hidden in the perfectly normal?" Hyuck seems to simply tarnish the situation and, in doing so, dangerously overlaps his hand.When an albino, for example, catches a girl who does stop in town and eat a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine that the director winks significantly in front of the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. <br /> <br /> The general level of production of Movies are also pretty low: after the halfway, the pace gets confusing and the story is tedious and obviously goes nowhere and is not particularly fast either. Add to that jerky editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture the real atmosphere - the empty streets of the coastal city are used in a criminal way - and I would classify the Messiah as a "missed opportunity" but Grindhouse enthusiasts will find enough to appreciate, even though it is not particularly gory, trashy or suspicious.
