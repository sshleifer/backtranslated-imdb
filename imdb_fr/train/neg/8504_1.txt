Semana Santa is breathtaking. It's so bad in so many ways that I do not know where to start. Let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose husband the judge was killed by shooting while protecting, goes from Madrid to Seville for his work as a police officer. During Holy Week (Semana santa, do you see? ... everyone starts falling asleep ... if it was bad in many ways, even from the beginning), a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullring. She teams up with the chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and the nice Feodor Atkine. Soon, she discovers that she will be the next target of the killer (who wears a red dress). Why, oh why? <br /> <br /> Why ..; This is the question that has been asked to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did I go to see that? I love Mira Sorvino (I even apologize for this shit AT FIRST VIEW) <br /> <br /> Q: Why did we only have 8 people at the theater this Saturday, the first weekend out? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-Man was released the same day. But also the fact that the film was filled with execrable criticism. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie filmed? A: money I guess. But did the boy need the money? <br /> <br /> so ... why ???????????? First of all, there is always a problem with European co-productions. You have here a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then, he wants to play on the same field as American thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although useless and badly scripted and filmed, was much better in suspense and pleasure. <br /> <br /> Then, to give a little bit of credit to the story, the scriptwriter wanted to add a political aspect to the story. . False: made in flashbacks in a traffic-type photograph, it is certainly the most interesting thing of the film. I could have stopped it, he would not have to go through the whole movie. Better to go directly to Guillermo del Tros' LE DOSSERET (El Espinazo del diablo) for a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Next, homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are gay S & M drug addicted twins who have been stabbed to death. The annoying olive-tree Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a surrogate unshaven shaved with a blonde wig in platinum. The character of mira Sorvino is a big dyke all the time. Do we need this stuff? Nah. Just unnecessary offensive remarks, just as before. <br /> <br /> Then the suspense. Yipee. No apparent reason. The first murders are an illusion, because they represent a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the murderer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been made from the beginning because it appears at the end of the film because, I guess, it was time for the director to say "weel, it's time to finish fucking Now let's see who the killer is and why he killed. " <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks himself a director. Bad: no suspense, no direction of the actors, no knowledge of the change of pace. A giant, mega-boron. The scenes of the Holy Week are useless (maybe a co-production rule saying: ok, turn in Seville but show some credits of this beautiful historic city with the celebrations of Easter.We are there: a mysterious film for the tourists!) <Br/> <br /> Next, the actors. All wrongs. Mira Sorvino is bored to death: she does practically nothing except being stabbed with her right hand. All she did best (Killer replacements, Mighty Aphrodite ...) was as if she had never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hello, there is someone? When producers will learn that he is not an actor but a dummy with no voice or feelings? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. We only have great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of the last century (and I hope for some additional roles in this one). She is the main attraction here because she is the only one to give life to her bad lines. I will not mention the other actors because they are only unilateral characters, without interest and superficial. <br /> <br /> Incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. Incarnate idiocy. <br /> <br /> The Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
