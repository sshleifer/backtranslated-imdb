Unlike others, I refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance (I do not want to give this style a bad name). Yet it is the most relevant description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Useless, unpleasant and ultimately foolish assault on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" simply leaves one wondering why the film was shot. and who in their right mind has given the green light to this dismal and entangled disorder. A biography of porn star John Holmes? A study of who this man was, why did he enter the company and how did it affect him? Awesome. Linked to be convincing, necessarily to be entertaining. Linked to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels (and I have no interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But a confused, violent, Rashomon-style study of a series of murders Holmes was a career partner to complete? Who cares? What knowledge do we acquire? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes' life, namely that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" might just as easily have been anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous adult movie star in human history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things a thousand times worse, the photo is loaded with jerkoff stuff - annoying machine gun editing, sloppy Dogme-95 camera work, unnecessary animation and screen-sharing, and so on. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a fascinating story and a single main character, the director (and I use the term vaguely) has gathered a dozen techniques from other films and decided to qualify movie film disorder, among these: the trendy and quirky look of "Narc" or "Traffic" or "minority report;" the sharp and frenetic style, often incomprehensible, of what has been called "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later"; the soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow" filled with every moment of silence with an old song evoking the period of the time the groovy and retro sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can" . The list goes on again and again and again. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie. I had real hopes for that. "Wonderland Avenue" has been around for years; If the context of the murders had been emphasized rather than the murders themselves, I think it could have worked. If the murders (and the growing involvement of Holmes in the lamentable types of L.A.) had marked the end of a career, or the late '70s, I think the film might have made sense; it could have been useful for something. As it is - meaningless. Needless. Who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown to the public? The case is not well enough known to warrant such scrutiny. <br /> <br /> This film should have been the third act of "The Story of John Holmes". That's all. Period. And it could have worked. What is it? Oh, well, they did not want to tell a traditional story of ups and downs. They did not want to do "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Okay? <br /> <br /> In a sense, they succeeded. There is a big difference between these movies and "Wonderland". The difference is that these films are good. <br /> <br />
