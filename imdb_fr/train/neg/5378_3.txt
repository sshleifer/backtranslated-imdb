I watched this movie that did not really expect much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which were pretty awful in their own way for less than a year so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some interesting points (some points stretch it), the occasional view of the camcorder is nice, the drummer looks a lot like a drummer, it's boring and In fact, the problem is that it's so boring, in that I can only assume to be an attempt to create tension, a lot of things do not happen and when it makes its boring quite tedious in advance, ready to support for most of the film, but has tried it) and it's really the main singer of the band who is superb, because they do not half mention how beautiful it is, j I thought he looked a bit like a policeman, all that and I did not even mention the killer, I will not even go into the details, it's not worth explaining. Anyway, for my part, Star and London are pretty much the only reason to look at this and with the exception of London (which was actually pretty funny), it was not because of their talent I certainly saw a lot worse, but I also saw a lot better. Better avoid unless you are tired of watching the paint dry.
