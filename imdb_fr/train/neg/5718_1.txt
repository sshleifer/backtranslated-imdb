There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this unskilled hacker who directed him needs to learn his craft. All of his characters in this movie were so incredible and I do not care. The best point of this movie was the end credits and the one hour shower that followed this cause, I felt so dirty that I was losing money with this stinking charge. Hey genius ... triads and yakuza come from two different places and learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this feeling was so hung up and useless. This DVD is useful. I really like my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So, kids are not wasting your money to buy this shit inn.
