Stupid and simply strange film about a child who is traumatized when he discovers that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who draws lists of naughty or likeable people. A Christmas, he takes the picture and begins to kill the naughty people - disguised as Santa Claus, of course. <br /> <br /> Boring movie and just bad of Santa Claus. If you're looking for gore, it's not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and they are not as bloody as their VERY fake effects. In most movies, Brandon Maggart speaks to himself and slowly goes crazy. The scenario is banal, the acting is terrible and leads to an end that made me watch TV, speechless. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I did not have hallucinations! Really REALLY poor end. <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas movie rent "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70s --- not the terrible remake). Avoid this one at all costs.
