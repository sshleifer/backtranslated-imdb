the cover of the box gives this film a beautiful appearance, make no mistake. Splatter University was released in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this film is nil. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. There is no plot in this movie, who the heck would ever produce that movie mess? <br /> <br /> The self-coach died <br /> <br /> the teacher died woman, we all know that we have to have a wife survivor, if you're going to break the rules, do it in a good horror movie, not this waste
