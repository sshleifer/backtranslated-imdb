Director Jonathan Lynn has already made underrated comedies such as "Greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More like a "Police Academy" movie than his inspiration, he stars Steve Martin in the former role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant, always pulling the scams under the noses of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy squad seems fragile when an old enemy goes to base, determined to take Bilko in the act. Nothing really happens. It's pretty dull. It's not very funny Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman exchanged laughter through hard work, but they are all better than that and it is very painful to watch them work with such fine material.
