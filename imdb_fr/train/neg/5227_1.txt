........ and a very bad at that !!! How long did this train wreck last? 14 episodes or something? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought the episode "Serenity" on Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. It's the ONLY good thing about this experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on the acting, because it was, I guess, pretty new people who didn`t had not really got the job. just right now. At least I've never seen them before in any major show, theater or television. If I did, I would have easily forgotten them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrible. Granted, it's not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did better than that. It was thirty-five years ago. I had a lot of fun laughing at the villains (reapers or something) as he pursued the hilarious Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines that looked like a gigantic rocket model. I was really expecting to finally see Coyote Wiley in the limelight while pursuing the Roadrunner. Modern jet engines / rockets do not do it that badly. <br /> <br /> And it was not even the worst. The "Far West" shootings made me wonder if I was really watching a science fiction movie or a Gene Autry movie. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste your time ... I do ... every 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
