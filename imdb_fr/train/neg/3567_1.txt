A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), Eileen (Blaze Berdalh, age 10) and Gage (Miko Hughes, about 3 years old) move to this beautiful Maine home - apparently unaware of half roaring noises The neighbor opposite (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets. is a sacred place that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead come back in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was This film throws ALL character development and just plays gore and violence. Animals are killed in front of the camera (I know it's falsified but it's always repulsive); a baby boy is hit by a half-object and his coffin opens during the burial (in a totally sick scene); he is brought back to life and attacks and kills people, including his mother (I wonder how a 3-year-old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (do not ask) tries to help the family for no reason ... The film just helps the audience to throw you all the horrors of death or violence. He does everything possible to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Take action does not help. Midkiff is just awful as a father - he is handsome and buff but totally empty. Crosby is not much better. The two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne alone records this picture with his actor's play effortlessly. <br /> <br /> This image shows a total disregard for the public who makes big leaps in logic and asks the characters to do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box-office success in 1989, which led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theater at the time and was troubled by the fact that the public continued to applaud the violence and was simply dismayed by what I saw. A horror film pushing back sick. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> When you think that everything is over and nothing can get worse, the Ramones sing a title song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really beyond belief.
