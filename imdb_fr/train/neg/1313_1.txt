Do not try to watch this terrible mini series. It's an incredible six-hour boredom, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It's a dry, boring, stretched and uninspired place as it comes up. And that does not even meet the level of technical competence expected. Take these six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
