Now, I have not read the original news to know all the literary points that have gone wrong here, so I will not go down that path. <br /> <br /> But I learned some time ago that Stephen King's movies are just not horror movies, with a few exceptions. He was not one of them. It's started pretty well, and for once, I'm not going to complain about the acting, even though Fred Gwynne was, as usual, wonderful. I will also forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were needed to advance the story here ... <br /> <br /> But there was a constant point for which I could not help myself excited. And that got closer to the end of the movie, and at least two characters took part in stupid stupid activity. The moments I am referring to are: There is a little zombie running around the house. You think it's under the bed. <br /> <br /> (a) get as close to the bed as possible before you blindly raise the duvet, exposing your entire body to the damage a cannibal of undead can do to you, or Br /> <br /> (b) Stay away from the bed so you can look under the fully open end of a slightly safer position, or at least see the mini terror come to you and give you a little reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I want to offer myself to the massacre today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Fun movie, however ... It's not very scary.
