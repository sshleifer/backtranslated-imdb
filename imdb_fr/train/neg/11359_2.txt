Although the 3D animation (the highlight of the series) did its job well, most of the other elements fell flat. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it's going to be 3D, so we do not have to work so hard on the plot or character development." And the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. The audience is drawn to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's father), as well as to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that all the main characters showed was a two-dimensional scooter that distorts the plot from time to time with its desire to eat everything. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the very end (after watching a very robotic version of the same historical character for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and spoils the good time to everyone by calling "contaminants" the main characters of the film and announcing the situation appearing on the screen was in fact an impossibility. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you just want to tell kids that Easter Bunny and Santa do not exist while you're there?
