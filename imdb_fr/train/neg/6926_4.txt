I have it in the DVD 10 Pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You must love these packs of good deals. Because even if they do not offer real remastering, restorations and everything that awaits me, and that films are usually in panoramic format and full frame scanning, it is clear that there are always some gems included. And by "jewels", I mean there's always shit to see, especially if the movies are from the 70s like The Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens are scrolling, it is the torture dungeon of Dr. Tarr, of Poe. Does not matter, really, like crap is crap is crap, right? Yes! But to say that this film is completely worthless is not true at all. There are some cool things here and there, and obviously the movie had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the opening title is nice with its negative sequence colored through a cheap television look. The dialogue is always hilarious. Towards the beginning of the film, the driver of the horse and stroller comes out to move a dead stump in the middle of the road. "WHAT FORCE!" said our hero. It's funny, then, that this guy is no longer able, later, to fight against the boobies when they come to have fun. You will completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he came back later, towards the end. That's how memorable these characters are. <br /> <br /> The best part of Mansion of Madness, however, must be the wacky music and hijinks of ball balls that good guys have to endure. It's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find nice. And why all weirdo slapstick, anyway? I would say that my favorite moment was when the horse and stroller were ambushed by forest monsters when they caught a stupid looking homemade ghost by a stick in the middle of the road and made the stroller stop. What is going on? Oh yes, there are a lot of crazy things to see for those of you who love this stuff too. Crazy, bad dialogue and crazy music. It's the best sum of Mansion of Madness for me. This is well worth at least a visit, and maybe a lot better if you have drunk a few or something else. I can not say I was bored of looking at him, but I can not deny that it's also a barrel of shit. A bit like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Poulet PWNZ.
