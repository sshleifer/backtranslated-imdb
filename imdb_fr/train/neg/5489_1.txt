The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial race on earth and tries to come home. During his stay on our planet, he will create friendly bonds with humans. <br /> <br /> But unlike ET that releases dramas, comedy, poetry, this film is just fun. It is indeed a pure production of Dysney: its target audience consists of children and the film is more visual than in the message. <br /> <br /> Thus, you will find fun scenes (the first observation of the "cosmic" toaster city) and the cast is experienced, with special mentions to "Doc", which rejuvenates in a character " Mac Fly ", and to Hurley, who seems open to self-deprecation. <br /> <br /> Ice cream on the cake: The main title is written by Danny Elfman and, like any other great composer, you recognize his "voice" even before he is credited.
