Van Dien must be embarrassed by the memory of this ridiculously poor movie, as does every individual involved. To be honest, I am rather embarrassed to admit that I watched it from beginning to end. The production values ​​are somewhere between the original series of "Crossroads" and "Prisoner Cell Block H". Most five-year-olds would be able to come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. As for actor performances, if you can imagine the most gargantuan porn you've ever seen - one of those where the action is complemented by an endless "story" to explain how an old blonde hottie Pouting peroxide ended up being spit - Razed by a couple of guys with mustaches - you'll get an idea of ​​the standard of acting in "Maiden Travel". Worse still, you can not even advance quickly to the sex scenes because there is none. A terrible movie.
