And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor is - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be declared with the same fear as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight has confided to this attitude a little more than slightly disturbed a behavior both adorable and scary that led you to hope for a more important role throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The other reason is Mr. Eburne's comic relief. Being myself in the medical field, I must congratulate the talent of a frightened hypochondriac. Although other "medical errors" have made people laugh briefly, especially when the good doctor is sampling drugs from fellow doctors ... slow film. The plot is predictable with only a few minor twists. Filming while creating a legitimate spooky atmosphere has been more productive for me to yawn - yes, you can use too much shade. and with a lot of caffeine.
