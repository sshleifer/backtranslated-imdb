In the first 20 minutes, the writer and the hack director wrote all possible clichés. There was the NTSB chief investigator on tortured family life; the NTSB board member, politically tortured, played by Ted McGinley [I can kill any TV]; the tortured father of a victim of the accident; and the crooked lawyer who pursues the ambulances. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no idea of ​​the fragility of the planes. The plane crashed on a 737 and it was essentially sitting on the ground, like a hippopotamus, who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact and the debris field had no wings or engines. Most people should have moved away from the number of people who survived this plane that was destroyed in Iowa after the loss of its hydraulic system. Most of this television plane was not even burned. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the scene of "Air Force One" where the 747 hits the water, then jumps as if it were thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad that it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, more tolerant than me, commented on the technical flaws. What surprised me was how this POS could be made. Are the producers of these things so accustomed to clichés that they can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars to make it a reality. I would have liked to be the guy's next date. I have a title on a beautiful bridge in New York that I would sell at a low price.
