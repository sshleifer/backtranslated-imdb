A group of children set up a theater to stage a horror film marathon that lasts all night. However, as the night progresses, there is someone among them who kills them one by one. Who is it ... and why? I saw him in a theater in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but my boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but that does not work. The story has lost its raison d'Ãªtre in the middle (this could be due to a huge editing before the release of the film), the killings are relatively bloodless (how it had a rating R exceeds me) and the unveiling the killer in the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's a shame - this movie had potential. With a better screenplay, it could have become a big horror movie. In the current state of things, it is almost totally forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed (I heard that Stone would not talk about this one). I give him a 3 and it's just for the casting.
