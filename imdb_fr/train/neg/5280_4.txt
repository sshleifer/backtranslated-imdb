Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser who works at the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin, from the terrible series "Step by Step" of the dreadful sweet series of TGIF group ABC, today fortunately gone), discovers that he has just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. He loses sight of what true friendship is and love and blah blah blah another nonsense. He must also deal with an uncle who wants to control the family business and a hesitant lawyer (is not it?). A slightly lower-than-average teen comedy that steals better teen comedies (the only opening is HIGHLY American Pie-Esquire). , you screw up on the head with morality whenever he has one, and spoil the only star talent he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I really expand the star word, Martin Starr of "Freaks and Geeks", and Justin Berfield of "Malcolm in the Middle"). It's not bad exactly, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some extras are topless <br /> <br /> My note: C- <br /> <br /> Where I am I saw: Starz on Demand ( available until September 29)
