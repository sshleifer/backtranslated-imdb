About 15 minutes later, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but of its absence. They decided to fill in the spaces where the funny stuff should have been with as much language as possible and absolutely vulgar language. When it stops (very rare), we sit down to watch (without laughing, but watch out) and wait for the next rude or offensive remark. After about 35 minutes, we got up and left. Everything we read said how awesome it was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it "smart" and said it was not a raw sex comedy. Did he go to the good movie? With Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've released ... and I do not regret anything. I'm tired of trying to see comedies in America.
