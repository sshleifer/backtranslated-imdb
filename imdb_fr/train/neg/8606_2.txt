I love killer insect movies, they are very fun to watch. I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite Shaun Hutson horror books. <br /> <br /> I met him and I wish I could listen to him. him like this movie was terrible as he said, after he said I was dying to see how bad he was. <br /> <br /> The plot: people are dying mysteriously and horribly, and no one has any clue what is the cause. <br /> <br /> Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but the authorities are making fun of his theory of killer killers. <br /> <br /> Only when the body count starts to get up and a slug expert from England starts rummaging around, does that sound like Mike had the right idea after all? ? <br /> <br /> This movie is the most flowing movie you've ever seen! The slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and it looks like they are moving fast in the scenes! <br /> <br /> This film has nothing to do with the book. The book was ten times scary, ten times bloodier and had a lot more history! <br /> <br /> I did not like. this movie at all! As I am a big fan of Slugs, the book and the second book entitled Breeding Ground! Both books are excellent. <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the movie.
