I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes would not have worked for Gilligan's Island. If it had happened in series, would there have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eva have had to replace her oven, but Adolf would have suggested the type that could accommodate 50 people? Another ticket compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem was that Lucille Ball was a genius of physical comedy and weird situations, and that mess was just plain wrong and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage done by the Nazis in England and the number of people they killed, I would think that the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem disgusting and that most normal people would would have killed before all episodes. Have been produced.
