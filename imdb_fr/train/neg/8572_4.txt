Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles for the honor of the family. David Morse is the responsible cop, the "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, the "bad guy", is a former soldier and former convict. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances according to the Method. Writer and director for the first time of this obtuse and arty drama, he uses his script and his characters in the same methodical process, thus slowing down the rhythm (an appearance so that we can grasp all the nuances and inflections). This approach could be fascinating if one has to be concerned about three-dimensional characters, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as brothers and sisters. Worse, we expect more from Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, two benevolent veterans who have little chance to present anything of interest. The picture is vague with turgid sequences, a wobbly narration and a confusing montage (always inclined to indicate the artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are mostly an irritation. * 1/2 of ****
