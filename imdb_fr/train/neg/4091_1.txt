Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is the most famous <br /> <br /> for "Zombie", and absolutely flawless "The <br /> <br /> Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add this to the unassailable list <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, is about a nekkid woman wearing a gold mask <br /> <br /> and a string. She wants the power of a doubled stallion who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magical <br /> <br /> because they shine. The boy of the arrow joins a guy who wears a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and they spend most of the film to save themselves one after the other <br /> <br /> in flat action sequences. In the end, the Nekkid chick is defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before removing the mask and remembering why I broke up with <br /> <br /> my high school girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathes each shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with <br /> <br /> smoke. Nothing like a smoking orange action sequence to make you crack for Sunny Delight and a cigarette. Special effects are laughable <br /> <br />. In one sequence, our homosexual gay duo is attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously scraped on the film itself. The majority of the effects budget must have been <br /> <br /> devoted to the Fulci-licious gore, which consists solely of <br /> <br /> injuries. Hey, we can all use a good nagging wound once <br /> <br /> while, but when you fall into the excess of the throbbing wound, it becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I kept playing with the brightness setting on my TV anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what was going on. <br /> <br /> We talk a lot about achievements of omens and prophecies, so let me take a look in the future ... if you find this movie and as you look at it, <br /> <br /> you will regret it. The scene on the video box (by Media) does not appear in the movie, regardless of the context. "Conquest" is a con job <br /> <br /> What MST3K could have done with that! <br /> <br /> It is ranked (R) for high physical abuse, gore, female nudity, brief male nudity and moderate sexual content. <br /> <br />
