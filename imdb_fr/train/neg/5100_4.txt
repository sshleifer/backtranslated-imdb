This animated series begins very well: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Everything is not explained immediately, a carrot hanging in front of the viewer, pushing him to watch each successive episode. But imagine the disappointment that the sci-fi / giant robot thriller adventure is just a fund for a predatory psycho-babbling and quasi-religious exploitation. If you want to hear "You agree, it's good to be you." after being assailed with negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, it's for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie to watch, forget this one. The original and the alternative ends have been disappointing for me. All this, AND this movie was too preached.
