Oh man, it's amazing how someone can claim that global warming is a science, well, I guess that elitist nonsense now replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to complicate things, even if it takes common sense to understand that all this is a big hoax on the part of a man with his own money making agenda! <br /> <br /> How did scientists estimate the historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the activity of the solar point. Has anyone ever asked if this method was correct? No, not even Gore himself! So how on earth would it not be accurate to predict the future temperature with solar point activity if it had been so accurate in the past? Depending on the activity of sunspots, the current temperature is exactly what it should be. How is it that the temperature in the entire universe has increased (relatively) as much as on Earth? Do our SUVs increase the temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You do not have to be a scientist to understand that it can not be anything other than a HOAX. Please search yourself. What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (a family of bankers who organized the event on earth) have to win? Well, the new world bank will be based on carbon credits, that is, a tax on anything that gives off CO2 emissions, and it's easier to get away if people are tempted to think that it is to save the world whereas it is only about money, centralized control and more power for elitist bankers. Al Gore even has a business that sells carbon credits! Is not it noble to voluntarily pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes into your own business? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blindly, do your own research and use your own common sense and I'm sure you'll make the right conclusion!
