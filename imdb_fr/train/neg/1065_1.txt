On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really apologized - we hated it all and spent all the time looking at our watches until the end of the movie. Half of the vignettes are weird, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes from Paris - for example, I was eager to see images of the Latin Quarter, but I could not recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater was laughing at anything or reacting in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious and pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss this. If you are like me on earth, you will regret having seen it.
