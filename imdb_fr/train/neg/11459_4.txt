Whalers are attacking the wrong whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo whale hunters catch a female and tie her by the caudal fin. The whale's companion sees everything, including the moment when the unborn baby of the female comes out and slips onto the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that the big guy is really furious with the way he looked at her as if he was saying, "Get out of town before high tide." <br /> <br /> This revenge story has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not much else. It was Bo's first film "out", although his first acting work was four years earlier in "And Once Upon a Love", released in 1981 under the title "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20th) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of good time ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
