This movie was over-excited. Many viewers, who thought it was "unbelievable", had to be in old school movies, because the whole movie is happening in the past. At first, I thought the movie was just showing something of the past, so I was expecting the faded dream to disappear as a clarification of the characters, but it continues. Basically, it was a movie that was trying to mix the future with the past, and the two do not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen with which the actors were working. There are too many movies that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no reason for critics to hype this movie saying "it's the greatest movie ever made." It's just shit on a stick. It did not help that the story was so miserable. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to have this film produced and I do not understand how the actors / actresses of this film are ready to be in a film like this one. It's almost as if everyone was reading the script and had forgotten to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on a computer". It was a film that should have been on a movie network, because nothing in this film was revolutionary. I am very sorry for myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
