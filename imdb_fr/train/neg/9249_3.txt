Watching the movie, I'm not sure where to go. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work and even play it, you can not do everything. I felt that the story of this film had really suffered because the director was wearing so many hats. Ms. McTeer is the movie. To add to her incredible talents, her portrayal of this woman was the reason why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes the drama and a beautiful story. I felt that this movie did not have that. Everything was a bit easy for the characters, there was no real obstacle preventing the characters from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for gentleness, but especially for Ms. McTeer's brilliant performance.
