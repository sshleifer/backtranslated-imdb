This 70's Italian movie does not even fit in the class of Dog Soldiers, The Howling or even this terrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a gorgeous blonde, go wild in her birthday outfit. We talk about graphics, complete nudity ... it is obvious that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is funny, the SFX are childish and the game of actors stinks (for the most part). The only value that redeems this film is all (and there are MUCH) scenes of nudity and sex. Tame HBO standards, but have fun when you end up without an appointment on Saturday night. OK ... HERE'S THE SPOILER ... There's NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine's ancestor (??). The girl just imagines she's a Werewolf ... in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
