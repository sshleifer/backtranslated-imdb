Until this new season, I was a big fan of "Little Mosque". However, the new season had absolutely ruined it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar has destroyed all the intent of the show. There has always been talk of living together to overcome prejudices. The new vicar ruins this premise and shows the Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim, but I like to watch the show and see the fellowship between Amar and the Reverend. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and finish it off. It's no longer worth watching. <br /> <br /> It could still be saved, but there should be a lot of changes. <br /> <br /> Bring back the old format.
