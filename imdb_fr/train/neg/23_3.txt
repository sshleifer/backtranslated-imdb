I rented this one on DVD without any previous knowledge. I was wary of seeing Michael Madsen appear in a movie I had never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not take a look. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Mr. Blonde would like a lot to forget that he's already been part of such a shame about a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and your dialogues are terrible, even the good actors can not save the situation. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this film. Too many non-English speakers speak English-speaking parts, reading the lines of a script that should have been discarded and not turned into a movie. It's amazing how all the lines of the movie are incredible. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks like a mediocre school game. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch it so you can enjoy better movies. That's why I gave him a 3 instead of the 1 he deserves.
