One of the most boring slashers of all time .. If you can even call it that. I would not look at that if it ended up being a kind of porn movie that he looks like completely. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kind of teen movies, so who were they really aiming for when they had this sleep party? My favorite part of this movie is the cover and that's the only reason I chose to look for this movie, which was part of the Suspense Classics 50 Movie .. and after seeing the other movies from this pack 50, you 'll realize that it does not belong anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
