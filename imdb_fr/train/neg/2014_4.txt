I remember enjoying this show as a child. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I saw. It was ultra high tech for his time. He could fend off enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and destroy almost anything that happens on his way. Now, I'm going back to watch her today and I'm amazed at how ugly this show is. The cast members are hardly convincing, there are a lot of cheese moments and the fight scenes are incredibly wrong. And almost every end has the same helicopter that fights shit with the obvious reuse of poor quality archive footage. Many reports seem to date from the era of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has essentially the same theme as Knight Rider, with the exception of the vehicle of choice for the fight against crime that consists of a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I found myself completely bored. However, I like the theme of music.
