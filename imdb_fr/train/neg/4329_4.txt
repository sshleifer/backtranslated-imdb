I will never forget the spirit and great comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation! The lines, the rhythm and the chronology of the events of this film are exceptional! However, this sequel to European Vacation is a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the Griswalds win a holiday in Europe as part of a game show. The problem is that a lot of jokes in the movie are little more than sweet, laughs one. For example, a flight attendant on a plane asks Clark: "Do you want your Coca-Cola to be canned?" Clark replies, "No, I'll get it right here." This is really the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor of European Vacation is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes of the first film, tried to modify a scenario already made and relied on a sequence of scenes of ridiculous sloppy pursuit towards the end of the image just to kill time. <BR /> <br /> Worse still, natural comic characters like Randy Quaid in the role of Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey so well from the first movie were not found. Their replacements are not funny, they can not act and give the impression that they spend most of the time in movement. There are also some jokes and rough sex comments, not just funny, but bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald should have stayed at Wally World. The place that captivated them! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should review Vacation's original movie instead! You will be glad to have done it.
