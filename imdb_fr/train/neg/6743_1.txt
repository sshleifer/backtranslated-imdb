How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream-ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is a little original but the film itself is a total failure. On the one hand, the dialogue is undeveloped, boring and wasting too much trivial detail, the acting is bad, et cetera. I want to get my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk.
