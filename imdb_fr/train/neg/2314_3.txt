Plot summary: When his wife, a journalist, is kidnapped and replaced by a double android, the secret service agent, Eric Phillips, stalking and discovers the project of an arms dealer to create a military army. invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. <Br/> <br /> I was not expecting much when I saw this sequel to "Cyber ​​Tracker", Richard Pepin's science-fiction / low-budget hybrid. This film was nothing special, not to mention a flagrant scam of the two films "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with a full action sequence opening the movie. There are many explosions, heavy fire and a huge amount of body, as well as martial arts movements thanks to the star of the movie, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes linked with minimal intrigue. On the actor's front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
