I read some of the comments on this film and I can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This film is nothing. It's so badly written, made and played that it barely makes an impression. The characters speak in a clich√© dialogue and the situations are completely implausible. While this may make it fun and fun, it is not, because everything is so lifeless that the movie becomes dull. It's as if Lee Rose had decided to write a drama about a woman who was fighting her sexuality, but the studio directors had not allowed her to give this story a realistic look or had no cojones. This film could be part of the encyclopedia as a bad television movie for life.
