The trailers in this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I would have liked to wait until this film came on DVD because at least I would not go out 9 $. The film totally misses the mark. What could have been a BIG film for all actors turned out at best to be a serial movie. The film moved VERY slowly and just when I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did it but it is not. Nowadays, we need unpredictable twists in the film, and this film did not offer either. The whole question of whether everyone is suspicious is good, however, I do not know if that was how things were directed, lighting, delivering lines, writing or whatever, but nothing came from it. A lot of hype for nothing. I was VERY disappointed with this movie and I tell everyone NOT to see it. Naughty saxophone music makes the film even worse. And the end had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a desappointment.
