The starting story is interesting: slavery at the end of the 20th century, from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that she intentionally castigated two of Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: the Arabs and the Germans. To make us believe that very Arab men could circulate freely and easily catch blacks in West Africa is as believable as whites looking for slaves in "Roots". It is evident that both trades are / were locally run and involved (d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in the trafficking of children and sex slaves, Israel is one of the worst abusers, according to Amnesty International. So why designate only the Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? This is an obvious bias and hatred of these people on the part of a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
