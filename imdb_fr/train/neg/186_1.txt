I did not know whether to laugh or cry about this misrepresentation of Canadian history, particularly the poor service to the history of Mounted Police in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> I will leave Pierre Berton to the task, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City, Yukon, and author of the final history of the Klondike Gold Rush, Klondike: The last great gold rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an indomitable border, dominated by individual heroes armed with six guns , was taken up in The Far Country, another story about a western cowboy - Wyoming this time - driving his herd of beef cattle into the land of gold. The photo is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity remains the major hypothesis on which the plot is played ?? that there was only one policeman on horseback throughout the Canadian Yukon at the time of the Gold Rush and that he could not fight anarchy. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the Customs House is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the gendarme?", asks Brennan. <br /> <br /> "On the River Pelly Problem with the Chilkats," someone answers. He has a very difficult job, this policeman. He patrols about ten kilometers - 200 km. Sometimes he does not go home two or three months at a time. "<br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory, at the time of the Gold Rush, was the most North-West Mounted Police were stationed in the territory in considerable numbers well before the Klondike strike, and they controlled all routes in the Yukon, and they had no doubt about it. They levied customs duties, often despite the cries of newcomers, adopted arbitrary laws on river navigation and sent men away if they did not have enough supplies or simply looked bad. In the Canadian way, they established moral laws for the community.In Dawson, the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed, it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday; fleshy women have were arrested for what the stern-faced police called "giving a risky show to the theater", usually nothing more than suggestively dancing on the stage in too revealing tights. <br /> In such a community, a shooting belt was unthinkable. A notorious villain of Tombstone who attempted to bring a weapon to his hip was personally disarmed by a young police officer, who had just expelled him from the saloon for the heinous crime of speaking too loudly. The villain left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, discovering he was carrying a rifle, told him to give it to him. "No man has ever taken a rifle," said the American. "Well, I take it," said the agent, softly, and did it without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for just a dollar and bought as souvenirs to stay on the mantelpiece. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the great year of the rout, was not a serious crime? And even less a murder ?? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, Denver's trusted man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country, Dawson is considered a community without any law, what is a character of Soapy Smith of Skagway ?? is his name Gannon in the picture ?? can easily control. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border saw all his equipment confiscated and was forcibly returned by a mounted police sergeant.) <br /> <br /> {"Yes I am the law and I represent the law in the Yukon Territory, about fifty thousand square miles of this law. " <br /> <br /> "Then why are not you more numerous?" <br /> <br /> "Because it was a desert yesterday, we did not expect you to enter by the thousands, now that you are here, we will protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "A position will be established here in Dawson City at the beginning of May." <br /> <br /> "What will happen? Between now and May, are you going to be here to maintain order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" And the rest of the time? " br /> <br /> "Choose a good man, swear him in. Make him play the role of marshal ??" <br /> <br /> The film Mountie leaves and no longer appears in the picture. His astonishing suggestion ?? that an American marshal, accompanied by a tin star, is sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence? is accepted. Naturally, they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal; it clearly corresponds to the game. But Stewart plays the role of the loner who deals with number one and another man is elected to be shot. And he does. Others are shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart ends up reluctantly concluding that he must end all shots with gunshots. He pinned the tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, disappeared to one another in the inevitable climax of the West. <br /> <br /> For those with a passing knowledge of Canada's North, this bald story goes beyond rational belief. <br /> <br /> ?? from Hollywood in Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
