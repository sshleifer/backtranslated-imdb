I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was a useless change of format. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This film looks like a remake of any other ordinary crime drama of the past. And that's what bothers, because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> Two aspects of this film intrigued me. First, I can not understand the title of this movie. It's misleading. Maybe a better title would have been "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo conceals a piece of evidence without giving the reason (at least to the viewers) why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, I'm just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk has returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
