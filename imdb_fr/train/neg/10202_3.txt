Murder By Numbers is one of those movies you expect to be made for television, but is not. Considering that the only actor of all the notes is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to evolve towards bigger and better things), it is not surprising that this film quickly disappears from memory to be replaced by more important things. Like ... you remember to lock your door when you go out. Or put on your clothes when you get out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with personal problems (are not they all). With her new partner (a damp-air Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual in it except that two young students think they planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect, Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> The disabling problem is that both tracks are hopeless. Bullock, while very nice to watch, is about as credible as Rodney Dangerfield in the role of a hardened cynical cop (actually, he would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I regret that he has to put this film on his resume to try to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as sneering suspects, do they correctly. As if the lugubrious tracks were not enough, a story that would make everyone sleep and a very predictable (but illogical) end of filming in the head before he has a chance to run. Murder By Numbers "has absolutely nothing against it, even a useless nude scene of Bullock would not buy him back, well, just a little but still not enough to save him - unforgettable, predictable and redundant - this is a film that will not advance the genre of the police.As Cassie probably says in her next case, there is nothing to see here.
