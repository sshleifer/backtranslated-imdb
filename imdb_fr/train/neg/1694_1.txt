This movie may sound scary in commercials, but the movie itself was a reason to throw up. This is a lower than average level (even lower than this one) and has no plot. I mean that every house can scare you and of course, a dead Japanese woman would scare you, but then what? Make a movie that will please the audience and not only show images of scared people and some hair (a dead Japanese woman). Can you say "horrible scam of Samara (The Ring)"? Do not throw me with "the dead child". Not so scary! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate him, a big deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save lives that could be hurt by the grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
