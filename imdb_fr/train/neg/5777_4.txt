It's funny when you stop and think about it: scared moviegoers have a deep and constant affection for those who scare them. The Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but who among us (the faithful) did not feel a real pinch of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE or for Ken Foree, forever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF DEATH? His cameo in the remake made me want to get up and enjoy myself (just like Tom Savini's cameo); I am not joking. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you have my drift (if not, stay upwind ...). Here are some of the heroes of horror. Seeing this gather many of them in one movie is almost unknown (at least to this degree, to my knowledge). If only the writer or writers had lived up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere on the line, will try again. As long as it's not a half-bodied effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
