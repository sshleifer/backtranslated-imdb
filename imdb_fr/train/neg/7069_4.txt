When the film was released, it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster. But honestly, the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has a Tag-line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" which means love is sweet but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the hero of the movie (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the main woman (Pooja Gandhi), even if they loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the slogan. This film influenced so many broken young hearts that they found this attitude of "sacrificial sacrifice" very thoughtful and so became the cult movie that it is, when they could have moved on. Ganesh plays in the film as being amateurish, crass and stupid puerile. In fact, he looks funny in a song (Ondu Ondu Sari ...) while he is supposed to look elegant and cool. Its appearance does not help the main role either. His hairstyle is poorly done in most of the film. LAW ON THE CANT OF POOJA GANDHI. His costumes are horrible in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good side of the film is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are really the real assets of the film. Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are also very well written. Director Yograj Bhat is to be congratulated for playing the songs with taste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, besides the songs, the movie is very ordinary !!!!!!
