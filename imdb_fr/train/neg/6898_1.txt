Avoid this shit at all costs. Wrong scenario, bad staging, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Have the idea? This film tries to be Western, it is not. He is trying to be violent, he is not. He is trying to present a fresh look at an old genre, but he is not. The actors do their best, and I give them their heart. But with such a foolish material, it's hard to make something shine. For me, this looks like a first attempt "of a new film school will set the world on fire". First-year filmmakers often bite more than their budget allows them to chew. The best thing to do is to take a few steps back, reassess what is possible and respect their limited budget next time.
