Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 shots of a pool and a house; 15 shots of indefinable office building; 5 countdowns by a soft technician; 7 close-ups of a threatening guard; and a myriad of technical bulletin boards showing us that it is a high-tech experience. <br /> <br /> Several posters commented on the discrepancy between the 1972 copyright date and the release date on the 1977 DVD box. It's easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the shelf for five years without being released, until someone dusted it off, thinking it perfectly matched the mood of mistrust that prevailed after the Watergate. After seeing The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it has never been published!
