In fact, it has never been. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s ball-ball comedy. What an empty ruckus! None of these people get close to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, today's audience is not as receptive to this easy shit. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is razor-sharp and obvious. The chemistry between the main characters is nonexistent. It is interesting to note that Julia Roberts seems to think she is the reincarnation of a big star of the "Hollywood Honor Age", no matter when. It's an effect she tries and fails again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
