... but it must be the worst adaptation of all time. And it takes time, with the efforts of various efforts of a lifetime. Do not get me wrong, I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I liked it a lot in other roles (see Sipsey in Fried Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives him no choice but to chew the landscape. And chew it like she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim for a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics anytime: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception maybe of Scrooged, all the others are just exaggerated efforts to capture the past Christmas spirit, present or future.
