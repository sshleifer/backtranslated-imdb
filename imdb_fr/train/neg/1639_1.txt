"Whipped" lasts 82 minutes. This opinion is 82 words. Three unfathomable New York Lotharios, ruthless "crooks", end up courting the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This applies to the story and the movie. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flabby and ridiculous, "Whipped" mixes the shock jock philosophies Tom Lykis with the fantasies of the Penthouse letter. Although technically competent, it is dated, creaky, poorly written, nasty and obvious. People do not act like that. People do not talk like that. Really.
