Even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save this dead fish from a movie. For starters, the script was written to be transformed into a B-movie, but Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to get out of the television) and Hutton (looking for "two" of a two shots "he had hoped to be able to define his career after" Ordinary People ") became attached to the photo. Cheesy lines, big rags from one scene to another (go for it - who uses wipes after the grade 12 telecommunications class?), And a stupid old man runs this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the plague of poor quality that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton stands out from the material. I must admit to having felt Duchovny's pain when he read the lines that make up the voiceover. While I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to be terrified, nothing prepared me for the conclusion of Duchonvey's voice: "If you need a doctor, make sure you call 911. " If only the studio had called 911, this movie dog would never have been done. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
