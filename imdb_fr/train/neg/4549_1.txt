Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Prophecy of Celestine", which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher without work in a mysterious village in Peru. The actors of home video quality present characters telling an overworked exhibition and a metaphysical hokum, while the film is powered by the extremely heavy staging of Armand Mastroianni. While there are some obvious attempts to measure and interest the fans of stronger banknotes in ABC's "Lost" film or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code," filmmakers are hardly the height. This film smells of the ill-conceived spiritual propaganda of mass consumption, and the results are so terrible that few people can cross this mess to pinpoint a real point.
