A particularly decried example of Italian cult cinema with an absurd title (in any case, the alternative film THE MARK OF Satan is even less relevant for the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a high dose of Erotica ) creates a kind of flat atmosphere in the whole ?? actually matched by the handling that is downright terrible! Here we have the usual group of people (a troop of actors) stuck on an island (to which they were invited by a count - since he had fallen in love with the leading lady, a deadly bell-ringer for his wife disappeared)! The characters are almost stereotyped: a dashing and middle-aged hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family story is more than his share of violent tragedy), a caring heroine, a sluttish companion (reminiscent of Mae West and emerging the most annoying a lot!), a gentle but devoted director (always reprimanded for his undisciplined behavior!), a lesbian couple, a mysterious gardener (the ever-present Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, participates in the action, if you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (the star rated Femi Benussi however, for what it's worth, it's really a piece for together), a religious fanatic of the butler, a woman of impressionable room, etc. mean unassailable, atrocious dubbing, snail pitch, poor quality production (with scenes depicting the raging sea leaping from a black-and-white movie!) and the fact that murders occur only in the half -final time will solve nothing. In addition, Marcello Giombini's score, while pleasant in itself, is also incredibly modern in the circumstances; That said, the revelation is surprisingly complex (considering the fact that the suspects are not lacking here).
