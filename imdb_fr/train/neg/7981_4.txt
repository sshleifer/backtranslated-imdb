The rookie suffers so much. There are random musical songs interspersed in the film, the long, scoreless script and enough burlesque to make Jerry Lewis squeak. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to stop. It takes an hour before the story finally reaches the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid Japanese stereotyped. But it gets pretty tiring to switch between two sets of characters. Then it ends abruptly. Even a naked woman Julie Newmar in a towel can not save this one. <br /> <br /> There is really little charm in the film and it's more than half an hour more. The story is hiding to try to put in place funny situations and without success. Stick to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano was charming and Jerry had that animated face.
