What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reshuffle gangster genre, crack more than he can chew with this one. <br /> <br /> The use of modern film noir to address the theme of the liberation of man by swallowing his pride, being kind to his enemy and giving all his money falls flat on his face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta, he seems crazy enough to make him crazy so he can break his head in the final scene. Why? Basically, you can not create a Mafioso like Liotta's character, who has probably regained his place in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behavior that is found throughout the film. Statham character's face. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying that I'm missing the point ... I'm not. I understand well? Get out of the quest for riches and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and that will drive him to self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and in itself, it is not a bad premise for a story, even if it is hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the director skills to achieve it. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realizes this, he seems to be bored with the story and starts to insert larks: The scene where Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel's comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many outstanding issues and outstanding issues at the end of the film that you could have all year 2001 about it and try to understand them, or just accept that it There are no answers and every viewer will interpret things in his own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pomp of the film that I did not care. Frankly, the end could not come too soon so that I would not have to go through this so-called psychobabble. <br /> <br /> A loss of two hours of my life.
