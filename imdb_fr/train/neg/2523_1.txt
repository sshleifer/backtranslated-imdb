R O B O T J X. <br /> <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely horrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no closure. <br /> <br /> Completely and totally the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this "Robot Jox" mess - and I just discovered it - THEY'VE DONE A SECOND!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar la Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their films. This mess makes these movies only bad - not terrible, horrible and grotesque like these. This is the only movie I've ever said that - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10 out of 10 people found this review useful.
