I think the shots and lighting were very poor. When I first watched it, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really discovered the real year of the film, I was shocked. I did not know there could be such a bad movie so recently. That's really all I wanted to say. This film had a good scenario however, nothing to be missed if you just read the novel written by George Orwelll. All I really want to say has already been said, other than that: I can not believe that this film could have received so many awards and nominations. I gave this film a (terrible) title, because I found very badly made. Well that's all. So long
