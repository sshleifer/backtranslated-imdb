ANDY HARDY BEGINNING MEETS (1940) is the ninth (9th) film in the series and shows the direction in which he was heading inevitably. The characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were going to be in the foreground. The rest of the distribution was going too far, just point the clock and get their checks back. The series would be up to the situation again and have its moments but a fatal decline has taken place. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone will continue throughout the series to present the character of HARDY JUDGE with sympathy. The rest of the cast would be professional even though he was less and less obliged to do so. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. The ANDY have responded na√Øve and incredible to any situation. Even after his return as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "teapot storm" was the same, juvenile. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is clearly illustrated. ANDY is found in several incredible situations that could have been solved with a simple explanation. This screen writing device was known as the "idiot plot". A way to stretch a badly written scenario. Perhaps it was not so much Mickey Rooneys' fault as that of the director and the writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz had directed one too much and needed a firmer hand to control excess Rooneys. To see our overview of the entire series, go to YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE (1937).
