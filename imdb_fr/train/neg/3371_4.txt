An incredibly improbable and stupid boiler that has at least some vivid and fearsome place photos, but too incredible to generate a lot of tension. I was hoping that Stanwyck would not go back in time because, really, she was struggling with the rain, in more ways than one, her husband, and she also had a silly child ... why NOT flee with Meeker? But the lingering question remains .. Of what kind of wood was the support of the jetty composed if a piece of decayed rot did not float? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does his best with the material, but he is worn out.
