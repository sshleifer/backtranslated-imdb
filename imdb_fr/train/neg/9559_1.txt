I will try to use words to describe this on .... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but at the time, I should have feared a suite. <br /> <br /> And I was "scared" when I took this one, but now that I've seen it, I must say it's even worse than I thought. Why these movies always get money still makes me dizzy. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors: they are not very good, but it must be said, some turn heads being simply awful. But what can an actor do with a scenario like this? It's about being a copy of the original but this time, the places have changed, any form of history has disappeared and any attempt to propose something that has not been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to update it, they try to make it exciting by using the whole "big brother" theme, but it was used a very long time ago and offers only a fill for the beginning and the end. We tried to save the film by making a ton of references to the 1983 original, but it ended up being just funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I do not want to say anything, to do ... go watch it or play Frisbee ... with the DVD ... all alone. It will give you the same pleasure. I promise you
