I did not see the trailer of the movie when I went to see the movie, but I relied on the opinions of a friend. Now, I love Chris Rock and his comedy, but this film falls flat. <br /> <br /> During the film, Rock delivers some funny jokes, but unfortunately, the film is sorely lacking in comedy. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love, and that's the case. The love story in the movie is simple (thankfully), but it's too much of a shame about the movie, making Rock serious and bland. After all, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not much of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also quite uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were completely discontinuous. If the support cast was to be funny, they certainly were not doing a good job. The couple of angels from heaven tried to make some dry and boring jokes. The submarine pair of Rock's first incarnation was also bland. If there is one thing they did well, they made Rock look funny by comparison.
