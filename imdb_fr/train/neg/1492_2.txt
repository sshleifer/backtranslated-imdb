Rented a lot of Blockbuster movies last night, and it was the first movie I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, I wanted a "horror movie") ... <br /> <br /> > Wow, it was awful, almost embarrassing then ... Silly story of slasher type I really thought that movies like Scream had ended there; amateur actors delivering clich√© and insipid dialogues difficult to believe have been typed and read on a page; and gory scenes that are not exciting (especially in poorly scripted movies). <br /> <br /> But I always thought that no movie was totally worthless. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: Love this actress. She is the only member of the cast to show any acting talent. The only reason I took the risk of praising this is because his name was on the cover. She acquires a presence in this neighborhood with professionalism, even if she sometimes seems confused to act in such a stupid history. <br /> <br /> # 2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I remember well. When there were still theaters at home in the country and they once included that kind of shit as the third movie on a threesome with a prestigious thriller that was finally heading to the backcountry. Unfortunately, in the era of direct video, most viewers now have to endure these turkeys alone without the common experience of being part of an audience that mocks and throws things to the screen because the movie is terrible . Which brings us to-- <br /> <br /> # 3 Pornstars trying to act !: Especially at hand, because producers do not need to cuddle or plead with them to undress for prolonged sex scenes, but this compromise This usually means that they have to speak certain lines that are supposed to advance a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "hardder!"). And, proudly, they all act brilliantly to appear stupid when they try to act. I almost excluded Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not supposed to be an Irish mother and she sometimes tried to make an accent, which only kept the smiles coming. <br /> <br /> good looking positive in all the experiments, and that's what I pulled from this cesspool aka "Evil Breed"
