If it is a product made in 2008 by one of the biggest production companies in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), I'm afraid we still have a very long time to reach the standards appropriate. <br /> <br /> If you can Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, whose casting is so huge, the making of a film has yet to be studied much harder by all those associated with this film. The film is missing in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has some good dialogues to make, but this alone can make you enjoy a movie with high expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car coming down the mountain in a river has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon movie. This in itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply lost. The gimmick of Anil Kapoor, who tries to express himself in English, falls flat most of the time. And Saif will surely wonder why he signed this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, IT IS THE GREATEST WASTE OF RESOURCES AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> We can not understand how and why this type of scenario was written and approved. The most undesirable was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the faulty script, the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar just gave some tunes to each song. The songs start very well and suddenly, the melodies deteriorate drastically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good in the lot. An opportunity spoiled by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> Regarding the continuity intelligence of the manufacturers, Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of ​​a foreign place (probably Ladakh). In the next scene, they search for Kareena in Haridwar, then return to the hills with Kareena in the car. I still wonder who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you manage to stay seated until the end, the climax is too long with ridiculous and useless stunts. You can see that all the heroes crossing the bullet storm are not hurt as if they were GOD. Do we still see a movie of 2008 with all these technical heights achieved? So, no more words on this pathetic and degraded film, but a sincere request to the main actors on behalf of their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible, request a preview of your films after their first copy. is outside. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People still clap for you when you enter the screen in your first scenes, respectively. I think this kind of film should not see the light of day because it damages the reputation of all those associated with the film, the actors and the production house.
