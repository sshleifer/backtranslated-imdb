Although I do not claim to be an expert on marine life, I must say that anyone with a minimum of intelligence could not subscribe to this idea of ​​a whale (and not even the mother!) Having a clue about revenge, he saw his dead companion being forcibly aborted by humans! I mean really! This is essentially the entire plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely difficult for the roles to accept this junk. This is the kind of film that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would want to ask for your money.
