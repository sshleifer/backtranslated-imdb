I saw this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie made such a fantastic movie. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. It is no longer Romania, but I see that the events take place at the same time as the 9/11 incident. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty images. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French viewers, not us. They really believe that's the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I do not really know if we can call it a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. It was a reality, but it is no longer the case. A good friend of mine from the Brithish embassy said: "You do not know how far the Romanians have come from Ceausescu".
