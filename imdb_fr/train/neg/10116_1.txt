Honestly, I want to find the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who can watch this film is Helen Keller, I kept repeating myself, it has to get better. <br /> <br /> Then the zombies finally showed up and they had raccoon paint on their eyes. <br /> <br /> They spoke like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> One drove a car. <br /> <br /> A voodoo woman asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (That was it) The movie came out I could not stand it Can I sue for Â½ hour of my life ?????
