Yes, The Southern Star offers a rather memorable title sung by heavy singer Matt Monro. That pretty much sets the tone for this drab and boring feature, with an incredible confusion between George Segal and Ursula Andress, an adventurous couple looking for a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) in pursuit of an ostrich, tons of wildlife footage, and poorly composed and boring photographs by Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a stoned all indeed exciting through the jungle of Senegal.
