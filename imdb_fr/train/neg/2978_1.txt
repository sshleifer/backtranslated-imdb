I am a big fan of horror movies and zombie movies are my favorite. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities to Dan O'Bannon's "The Return of the Undead", but while this film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. He has some of the most laughable actors I've ever seen, especially from the main scientific character. His scenes with the general were simply hysterical. In addition, the effects are mediocre and, in many cases, sloppy, and scenes of death are often simply stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the zombie head cut off, which then opens his eyes and flies away one way or another FIDE OF THE FRIDGE (obviously unjustly released with a little string) neck, kill him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies all the laws of physics known to man, and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed. This is just one of the many really zany moments in this silly mess. I can not believe his odds are so high here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this miller.
