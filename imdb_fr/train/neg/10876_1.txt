What was a D-Movie? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogue / intrigue I have ever encountered. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a beautiful cameo as a panicked policeman. However, the rest of the movie is horrible and boring. It's not even that bad, you can laugh at it. Just shit. And anyone who compares this to the Evil Dead Series could just as easily compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least, there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 of 10
