Hi everyone ... <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say for this movie. The basic plot is that a man (Brandon) takes some friends to his cabin in the woods for a holiday weekend away from work. After catching a girl on the way, everything starts to go wrong for them all. <br /> <br /> The story alone (written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I may be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted upon accordingly. The "killer of clowns" himself is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark predator, mysterious but above all intelligent, we are instead offered a rather clumsy buffoon, singing nursery rhymes, which seems to be going through a minor crisis at mid-life. The only thing that justified the writing of this comment was the scenes of sex and all that was gore in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some pleasure). <br /> <br /> In short, this film falls below all possible standards. It was true that I shared a few beers with a close friend while I watched this. We have therefore managed to bring together a relative entertainment value in this film. So it is fair to mention that S.I.C.K fell just below a rating of two. However, in reality, and with hindsight, the evaluation to a star is more than legitimate for this film. <br /> <br /> One in ten stars.
