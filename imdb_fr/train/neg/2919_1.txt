Damn, as a gay man living in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the belly of the gay culture that is portrayed in this film - and I'm delighted !!! If this film had been broadcast on television in the United States, there would be a great anti-gay reaction and I can not say that I would blame them. The characters in this film do not represent the average gay American nor even the average American Trandgender, but represent a nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-whites) are blatant and disturbing. the actions of these people are not acts of despair, but rather a rejection of everything that resembles a personal ambition and a willingness to do something of oneself.
