As an ordinary spectator, I can not say that I liked watching this one. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too captivating for a thriller, not too fast for an action. In addition, some moments of the film are hardly credible. OK, I understand, the soldiers are a little crazy, but it's hard to believe that a person is risking his life, takes the car in the middle of a hostile city and after shouting, the teacher's wife has run away without asking a question (appropriately). It might sound terribly romantic if it was an animation, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about the war. There are several episodes like this one; it requires a lot of work. <br /> <br /> We have the impression that the filmmakers want to create the image of a brave emotional soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply abnormal. <br /> <br /> This image left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO, this is the most thrilling part of the movie :)
