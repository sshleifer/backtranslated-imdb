Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and confronts a group of Georgetown graduates with situations in adult life. The screenplay is a messy mess, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of talent and wasted time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham are featured. The most notable are McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty odious. Being an adult is not so easy.
