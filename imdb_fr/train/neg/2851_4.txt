There are often badly matched couples (in the general sense of the word) in Huston's films: "African Queen", "Heaven knows Mister Allison", "Roots of Heaven", "Misfits" ... "The barbarian and the geisha "(check the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that the Japanese were fashionable at that time. Works such as "Sayonara", "Suzie Wong's world" and "August moon's tea room" bear witness to this. Huston's effort is perhaps the worst of this bad spell (with the exception of "Susie" perhaps). John Wayne fits perfectly into the world of Ford. In Huston, he is like a bull in a porcelain shop. His Japanese partner is totally bland. Dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are completely enamored of every work of Huston must choose it, among all its other great films.
