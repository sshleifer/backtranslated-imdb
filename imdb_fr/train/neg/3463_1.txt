I saw this movie the other night and I must honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is right, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the film" and if the film is burned, the killer will die? How is this incredible? The characters were at least underdeveloped ... For example, suddenly, the man mentions "Do not you try to finish the film because your mother could not?" So are we supposed to accept that? We did not know it was his daughter until half of the movie. The film really did not attract attention to anyone, we did not know anything about the main characters that survived, except the character of Ringwald who was a great actress, the guy was on the set when the people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like his mother. . Not really dive to find out who they are. Things seemed to have been rushed to get to the killings. The whole plot is too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who loves this shit obviously needs to learn a thing or two about making movies. I can not believe anyone would play or even work on this picture. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was a clich√© throughout the film. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which makes me think that it was not difficult at all. It is a shame and I am deeply sorry to have lost an hour and a half watching the damage. 1/10.
