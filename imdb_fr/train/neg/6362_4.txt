I am a big fan of Italian movies of the seventies and I would not hesitate to include the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time. So I went in this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes clear that it is a largely useless film that will not go anywhere. It is clear that no one expects much more, but the fact that it is useless becomes more and more annoying if you consider that it is also rather boring and that none of the characters are interesting. . As the title suggests, the film focuses on a "thug"; in this case, the one who steals, handles and smuggles things. It's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film has a real style "seventies" and the idea that everything is very carefree is going well. Sometimes it seems like filmmakers Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson have tried to make a point, although that's not the point. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and this is the case here too; she is definitely the best thing in the movie and the sequence in which she walks naked in a car is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue is likely to appeal to seventies fans, but unfortunately it does not have much to offer.
