Jane Russell has proved to be a delightful performer of musicals with the same title entitled "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but, unfortunately, this movie wastes those skills. There is a budget and beautiful Parisian photos, but the film just does not work. Ms. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. This leaves no one to play Jane Russell properly. Some of the other players are REALLY out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; Above all, be warned: there is a musical number where African cannibals with their heads watered "cook" the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sang in a gorilla costume. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (29/10/55) Richard Dirty ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
