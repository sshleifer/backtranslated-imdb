At the beginning, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - it shows the difficulties of a real restitution of esoteric questions. I loved the book and I was totally disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and the story poorly explained. The novel - in the first place! - was not meant to focus on an adventure! It's only the surroundings. In the film, the emphasis is on this point and the message has gone to the background! In addition, the visual effects to show the energy of all living beings and the elucidation of events at the end were parsimonious! They messed up everything! ... I will never look at it again!
