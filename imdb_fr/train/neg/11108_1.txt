Where to start The film started pretty well, but after 30 minutes I caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the beginning of the movie was good but the story started. It has become more and more stupid with time. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this film, but I got a little bored of the constant consternation of Vinny Jones in the film. <br /> <br /> While the film was dragging and taking me on word, it was dragging, it became more and more difficult to find. <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not be worse, towards the end of the charges if monsters looking like Skeletons appeared, just to eat the dead, which made no sense. It turned out to be a kind of flesh-flesh worship and the good ones die in the end. The end actually made me laugh how bad it was. Once the lead role has Vinny Jones, he becomes the new murderer. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film gives Creep the appearance of the best horror film ever made. I gave it 1 star because the main female role did a very good job but even she could not save this sinking of a movie !!
