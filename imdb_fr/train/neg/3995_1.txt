"1408" is the last bastion of cheap panic tactics. Those who could make horror fans like the date films occasionally throw themselves to their seats and scream in their ears, but disappoint the audience by seeking a little depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusak plays a writer who has made a career. to write books describing his experiences of staying in haunted hotels, according to rumors. Despite assurances from customers and homeowners that ghosts roam the corridors, there is little impact that would make them a strong proponent of the paranormal. When he learns the story of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel (without waiting, I mean, the Dolphin Hotel in New York), he decides that it would be the perfect closing of his latest book. But Samuel L. Jackson, interpreted by the owner of the hotel, tries strongly to dissuade his guest from telling the atrocities that have occurred in the tea room since the opening of the hotel many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must attend the long walk of Jackson. <br /> <br /> In other words: be afraid! Be very scared! <br /> <br /> Of course, it would be easy to convince the public that he just paid to see a thriller from start to finish if editing does not take so long. At this point. And also, if what followed was much more than cheap "boos" that become so frequent and so arbitrary that you could wait for them soon. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls are dripping with blood. The intrepid writer can not open the door, etc. And after almost an hour and a half of broadcast in front of the public promised to great chills, you can sit down and hope that at least you will be impressed by the end. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time wasters, even if that is not enough to dispel our doubts about the fact that before the end of the film, we could finally have something to do to make the film a little less than forgetful. <br /> <br /> Despite the great performances (as always) of Cusak, which is essentially the entire movie, most of the other remarkable people are wasted (ie Samuel L. Jackson) in roles insignificant minors. The real mystery here is how this movie received such a popularity rating. Ghosts stuffing ballots?
