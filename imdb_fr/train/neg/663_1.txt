Imagine the scenario - you're in the cinema only because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're done with the museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie in the same way as the trailer and you do not have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - Bank work, in Bruges, the Leatherheads or the end of the year ball. You've seen Bank Job (a surprisingly correct movie) and In Bruges (again, very good), so you only have two left. You do not want to watch Clooney or the nice officer in the 1930's football uniform, so you'll see Prom Night, right? False. You take the $ 8.50, you go to a stranger in the street and you ask him to hit you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be money better spent. <br /> <br /> It's more like a comedy than a horror / thriller movie or whatever it's supposed to be. If I finished this film and showed me that as a final editing, I would not know if I could laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... my roommate laughed at most of the movie; as for the actors' game, they could just as easily have launched robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective must be perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his interpretation so much that I do not care how you spell his name), you're relieved of your title.) <Br/> <br /> In summary, "not good"
