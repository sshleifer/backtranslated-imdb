If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, do not give up the series. I bought my first copy of one of the books in May of this year and I have almost finished with the book 10. I dare to say that the film is a waste that does not make the series even a sniff of Justice. While "Left Behind: The Movie" only loosely follows the story of the "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not even specific enough. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts his feelings for Hattie (he is on the point when he will be informed of the disappearance); Buck Williams is a magazine writer with blond hair and not a television journalist. Chloe is at Stanford and many of Rayford's book details wonder if she has "survived"; Buck and Chloe meet only much later, at a meeting organized in New York by Hattie. Irene and Raymie are never "in the book", but simply in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so cluttered with wrecks after the kidnapping that Rayford and Hattie have to go to the suburbs by helicopter ... etc, etc, etc ... <br /> <br /> And this is only the first movie; they are about to release the third. Please, even if you do not like movies, give the series of books a chance.
