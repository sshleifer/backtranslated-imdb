Michael Jackson would have claimed a place of choice for the high-end character of THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves children. It did not work (and why should it be?). Eddie Murphy decided to save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would strongly suggest that all future writers carefully study the actor's insane dialogue in this fantastic comedy, adventure and bizarre fantasy that takes one step closer to ISHTAR. Everything Murphy says or does may be better, but do not misunderstand his exquisite comic talent; he does not belong to this film, and the same goes for DR. DOLITTLE! Violence and visual elements combined are reasons that make this film a cult classic. It would not have been logical, as Hollywood moviegoers and moviegoers continued to make the most of it. Speaking of graphics, they were remarkably successful in the days of Ronald Reagan's presidential celebrity. Murphy is MUCH better at COMING IN AMERICA and at 48 HRS, but this outdated movie is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.
