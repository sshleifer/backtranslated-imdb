This film seems to start from the middle, presents the peripheral actors as if they were significant and presents main characters without any history or background of fine paper and / or impenetrable. Almost no one has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this movie. The plot comes out and finally leads to nothing, the dialogue is clumsy and banal and the director has no idea how to get the best of his actors. It almost feels like there is a first half of this movie, but it has never been done. <br /> <br /> We are told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York and that Central Park has become inexplicably an arctic wasteland. Yet none of this seems to have stirred much agitation among the population and is of little concern to the government. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to "perverse society" in eugenics, but it's really fair. a convenient pretext to populate the universe with a few henchmen capable of triggering power. The double meaning of "eugenics is bad" is heavy and has never really worked. We are supposed to worry about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely unexploited that it is a fatalistic rationalization of one hour and 40 minutes for rape. <br /> <br /> In the digitally created "revolutionary" world created here, all I can say that it's about the same time that this film was shot that several other directors did the same thing with more homogeneous and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending the time necessary to watch this film, the most burning question remaining in my mind was, "so what?"
