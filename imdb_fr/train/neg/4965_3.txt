For such a great classic tale, the setting, Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script that was completely lacking in dramatic tension. The section of the club's history is useful and would have provided a new interpretation of the literary classic. For some strange reason, this topic was removed early. Knowing that it was fired in 21 days told me "rushed" and it is seen unfortunately. We will now have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can tolerate a really crappy CGI, but the script has to switch and it was too slow, Spartan and lacking in drama. I would blame the actors but ... as I can write more than act, I will go after my colleague.
