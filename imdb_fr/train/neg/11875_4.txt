Mmm, does not a big stack of pancakes ring well? Maple syrup and fruits preserved on the top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. Eat it !!! Continue shoveling it down your throat until your face becomes green with nausea. You have just experienced the Ally McBeal experience. <br /> <br /> I came across this show in the winter of 1998 and was instantly hooked. Like this pile of pancakes, I sip on it. But the pleasure soon dissipated, because the character of Ally McBeal (whom we see to be cute and endearing at first sight) quickly becomes the most annoying, the most unstable, the most insignificant complainant you have ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my wife to have a thorn.) The changes and rewrites make the show a soap opera. <br /> <br /> I advise you to take this show in small doses and to quit as soon as it becomes boring (and it will be). I did it for 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment was completely sour. It was good as long as it lasted, but as a crazy and neurotic ex-girlfriend, it just turned sour after spending too much time as planned. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like the fruit cup. It'll go with you a lot better.
