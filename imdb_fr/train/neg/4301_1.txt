I stayed one night and was very bored around 2 am, so I was aimlessly returning through the canals and falling on H.B.O. where this "classic" was playing. At first, I was happy to have caught something in the beginning, but my happiness faded after two minutes in the film. The whole film was centered on an unattractive man who feared women, four beautiful but empty-minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's restaurant and his extremely big and extremely miserable cousin who also works in the restaurant. There are some strange twists in this movie that make it a bit interesting, but certainly not interesting to watch. Basically, if you have nothing to do overnight or if you can not sleep, the drugs work much better. However, the guys have a lot of skin, so it may be ok to watch without sound, but even that can get boring
