Even if it was a production intended for television, there is no excuse for the lowest results of the finished product. This DID movie had a budget and a casting department, so if you want to make a movie about a true story, and actually put "true story" in the title, do not make any effort trying to grab a certain realism? First of all, this film is absurdly casting. These actors belong to the soap operas of the day, or those ridiculous movies from Lifetime, and not to a real gangster / criminal story. Everything about them, from looks to mannerisms, just screams the generation of the 90's-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listens. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again, it sounds too much. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words "I'm out of here." It's as if a group of fans of "New Kids on the Block" was coming together and decided to make a really "kewl" movie about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, a film that would be totally radiant and rock. Well, this sticker does not even rank on the scale. Anything that can be wrong with any type of film is wrong here, from casting to play to editing and music. Everything is grossly false ... and it is infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the gall to put "the true story" in the title. It's certainly not the true story, but even worse, it's not even distracting like a popcorn movie without a mind that is accepted on its own terms. As I said in my title, it's horrible beyond words, at every level imaginable. Trust me or look at your own risk.
