I think that's almost all I have to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions however. Basically, I have never seen such shipowner production, and I think in every sense of the word. Although the physical work of the camera, the operation of the micro-boom and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, this is unfortunately not the only area. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic indie films that have been saved by their script, a great characterization and a plot, it unfortunately has a horrible scenario, a terrible actor's act and the worst of all, annoying terrible characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that for every independent film obtained, a cast like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other independent films that died of silent deaths. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers are at Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production was distributed. I am quite puzzled as to why they took it. <br /> <br /> The only part of this film that resists any plot is its title. However, the reason is even a disappointment. I hope this review will save some people who might be intrigued by this movie title to go watch it. I saw a lot of movies in my day and I forgive a lot when I'm at the movies, but it was too much. I will never forget "tunnel" for having marked an important point of my experience of life in the cinema. Too bad it's a low point. <br /> <br />
