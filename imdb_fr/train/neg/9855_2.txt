Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many crazy arguments try to support the film's claim that dragons may have never existed. The film mentions links in different stories from different countries, but fails to deepen them, which could have given it some credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a fantastic story told about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with very popular forward flashes, as shown by television shows like the CSI, to give the impression that it has something scientific about it, which is certainly not the case. In many cases, the arguments / indices are far-fetched. In some cases, the clues used to show that dragons existed or were flying or spitting are simply nil. Seeing it gives me cramps on my toes. Even a fantastic movie needs a certain degree of reality, but this one just does not have it. Bottom line: it's a pretentious-CSI fantasy documentary, which is not worth watching.
