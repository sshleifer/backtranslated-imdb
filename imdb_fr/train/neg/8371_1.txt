I think it's pretty safe to say it's the worst movie of all time. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew from the second second that it would be a piece of **** and that it would be better to avoid it, but Some friends have trained me to so, I entered the cinema with few expectations, but I hoped that there would be some laughs cheap to keep me awake during this film. The so-called "jokes" of this film make your face shudder. They are mainly composed of people who hurt themselves in the face and the balls, the baby who looks weird and behaves like an excited gangsta and the jokes that we see so often. in today's waste comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and very stereotyped. I never want to see this movie again ****, I prefer to take a shot in the foot than to be exposed to this piece of shit ever. If someone I see says he liked it, I physically hit him in the face
