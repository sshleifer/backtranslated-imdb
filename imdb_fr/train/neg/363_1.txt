what ends up killing this film is its self-awareness, among other things. Here is a short list: 1. Irreverent behavior. when the beatles came and injected their "weird, irreverent" behavior / humor brand, they were greeted as fresh. it was more than 4 decades ago. overcome it. <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. spitting the base, quasi-socio-political-isms is a difficult terrain to do comic work. ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3. the post-modern "I am hard on this artificial world and yes, I recognize it in myself", the snake eats itself - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - is such a retreaded tire. <br /> <br /> 4. smarmy, smug drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, acting, staging ... Have you ever seen student films? a victim in itself, the only positive thing I can say is that she has at least a sense of herself, and sheesh, now I am caught in the reflex she poses as valid, valuable. <br /> but towards ... what? in the end, it sounds as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey, do you still see Woody Allen's version of Bergman, that is to say: "Interiors" ??? Well, it does it more amateurishly.
