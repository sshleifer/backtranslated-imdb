I did not even bother finishing the movie because I was so bored I thought I was going to faint I was watching it in the cinemas and my friends and I were tired so we got up and went to another movie having to sit for 2 min. I think that I will shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I was not surprised at all I mean, whoever did not know her was going to make the right choice and leave her happy, I mean in reality, you'd have to be completely stupid to not know it. I know I have not missed anything and if someone asks me to see this movie, I would say "on my dead body".
