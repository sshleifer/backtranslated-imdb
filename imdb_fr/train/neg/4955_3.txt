In the light of the recent and quite good Batman the Brave and the Bold, the time has come to deal a fatal blow to this error in Batman's life. Being a big fan since the first awakening of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tones in the character, dark or campy. This one is simply not credible: too much effect, bad intrigues and so few questions. What's great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. The Batman only shows it in his days of karate. And besides, how is it that the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when it jumps in the air, whatever its heavy build? And look at the Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotyped reggae, which fan of Batman could accept such betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without "The" article in front of his name.
