Laborious Comedy at I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall investigating an eccentric farming family in Maryland who never paid his taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the tomboy farmer who exerts the burden on the not so selfless tax collector. Debbie certainly did her share of lower theatrical sitcoms during this period - and this one is neither better nor worse than the others. The picture begins brilliantly but the flags are halfway and become frenzied and witless. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad mix, so that all actors sound as if they were stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
