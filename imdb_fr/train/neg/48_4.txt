There are some beautiful shots in this film, it captures some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably his best asset. <br /> <br /> But it's more a movie made for television, and although the plot has many twists, which makes it interesting to watch, there are no subtitles and the key developments of the plot are unveiled in Spanish, so that non-Spanish speakers will be a little lost. <br /> <I had it like a Christmas present, because it's a family trait through the movies of an actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in "A Time to Kill" , and in "The Newton Boys" so I expressed the wish to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, although it is stated on the DVD box that it is a film of Matthew Mconaughey and that he uses it as a marketing ploy, he has some lines and is at the screen. for a few minutes at the end of the movie, it's actually an extra and it does not turn on the screen while it's on. Ally is not worth it from this point of view. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie is good, Patrick McGaw is great and very easy to watch, and his character is so nice and kind and caring, a real saint of a guy, it would be well written in a ROM com. <br /> <br /> So, for the real brilliant Mcconaughey actor of those I saw, I would recommend, "A time to kill," "The Newton Boys" "Frailty," "How to lose a guy in 10 days "," Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoid" Larger than life "and" Angels in the outer field "unless you feel like a children's movie around us, because neither the neither are revealing of his talent, but are rather amusing films for the children. Again, MM is really nothing more than a secondary artist with a few lines, if any. <br /> <br /> Regarding Scorpion Springit's This is not a bad movie, but it's not screen flying either.
