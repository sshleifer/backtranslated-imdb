Even though there were some fun moments, I thought the movie was pretty bad. The longer it worked, the worse it got. Once the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself looking at the beautiful outcrops more than the increasingly stupid and unconvincing interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the girl was particularly inconsistent. First, she is in the market, then discovers the truth and she knocks. Then she is back, then deserts them again. Then she is back. There is no apparent motivation for any of his decisions. There were interesting characters, interesting scenes and many missed opportunities. I must say that the images were much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently, those who loved Repo Man were inclined to love this one. Searchers 2.0 is not a match for The Searchers.
