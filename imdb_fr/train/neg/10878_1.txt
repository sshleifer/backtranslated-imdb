This film is so much a scam of the "demons" of masterpeice and that's the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The acting is terrible, the action scenes are accelerated, the scenario is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you have not seen a real horror movie, skip this. and get a copy of the demons from the movie.
