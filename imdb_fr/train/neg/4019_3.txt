Dakota (1988) was another first star vehicle by Lou Diamond Phillips. This film is similar to the last movie released Harley. There are some differences but both are identical. I do not know which came first. I guess it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But they are both "children" in trouble trying to transform their lives. Instead of bikes, this one involves horses. They are basically the same movie and they are both cheesy. If you are a serious L.D.P. fan so I recommend you watch both. L.D.P. if you're up, go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. Fans !!!
