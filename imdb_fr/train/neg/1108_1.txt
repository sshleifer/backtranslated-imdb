A piece of dull and useless down (bloody down, but down). Wrong scenario, insane and woody dialogue. You do not care whether the characters (in fact, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Small grace or charm, small action, small point to the whole. Some sets and scenery may be interesting - these differences between the panels of all buildings may be faithful to the way life was lived. The meeting with the executive is useless and distracting, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy himself is both boring and inept.
