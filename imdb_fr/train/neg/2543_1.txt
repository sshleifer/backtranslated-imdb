talk about your waste of money .. I was just wondering why Michael would play in such a turkey film ... Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer .. c ' was wonderful. as he registers himself for his son to see him once he has grown up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do this ??? I looked at it and I thought it was really stupid .. I guess at one point in their career they have crappy movies .. especially "The Squeeze". I did not understand that one at all. I think his best performance was in "Pacific Heights" ", his character really scared me .. and I really enjoyed" Multiplicity "... that was so hilarious !!! and it was just perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I kinda liked "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too .. just a pity that some of them end up doing ugly movies ... like this was ...
