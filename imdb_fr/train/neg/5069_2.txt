I have a serious problem with this show, many in fact. A simple list will suffice for the moment. I will go deeper into the following: superficial characters, funny laughter and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to look at the rest of this story go through and read only so that you can feel superior (as if you see something I did not see in this show) at a often irritated teenager of Canada, I will summarize: Friends are worthless, not only because it's not funny, but because it has destroyed the viewers for new and good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.). Friends is just as much to blame for the reality show, "Two and a Half Men" and "The King of Queens" as television executives. Now, let's go to the exam. <br /> <br /> These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in all respects (apart from the genre and the color of the hair). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely safe in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor that goes with it? Why does not Rachel reach Monica after Monica starts hanging out with her enemy? Why does Joey not think about suicide because no one seems to take it seriously? Oh yes, because he's silly and he's comfortable with that. It is the curse to have perfect characters: permanent conflict and (conversely) the personality becomes an impossibility. <br /> <br /> The laughter track is the only thing that should have disappeared right after birth. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a generalization? When a show that claims to be "comic" requires someone's laughter BEYOND THE PUBLIC, it means that the audience would not risk without laughing. Laughtracks destroy humor by preventing quick returns. Humor becomes a construction rather than a free entity (see The Office, Arrested Development). <br /> <br /> This brings me to my next point: humor is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character other than slightly humorous (without a seemingly laughing track) simply because our everyday humor comes from recognizing our flaws. What if Monica had a 17-year-old daughter? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing is not right and breaks with him. There must be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe his mother learns it or one of his friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a battle for the guard! So now, I have provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this series because they have not heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. Many of my friends hate her because they have recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> In my life, I have watched very little "Friends", but I have seen enough to spot huge flaws that, in my opinion, make the series completely unassailable. If you have read so far, thank you and I hope you will at least start watching some of the programs I mentioned.
