Bruno Mattei, veteran of football, resumes his rhythm with this erotic thriller which clearly echoes the 8MM Joel Schumacher. But, as one might expect, Mattei turns his film on a tiny budget, so it seems already obscure when it comes out. <br /> <br /> After the abduction of her daughter, a mother enters the dark world of clandestine pornography, because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that makes snuff films as long as exclusive customers pay well . The search for his daughter does not only lead the mother across Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes to bed with guys to get her clues. When she finally gets in touch with the snuff organization led by the mysterious Dr. Hades, she enters herself in great danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this one, even if it starts to be promising. The problem is that the film is by no means as sordid or as explicit as one might think of the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first published in Russia!) Is neither bloody enough, nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really grab the viewer's attention. The plot is not that special either, except perhaps for the surprising number of different places across Europe. The end is extremely disappointing. The acting is not really remarkable either, with the exception of Anita Auer who plays the role of Dr. Hades: she looks extremely scary. You do not want to meet her like that in a dark alley (or in your bedroom, by the way). <br /> <br /> In total, SNUFF TRAP appeals only to Bruno Mattei's film collectors. But it's good to see the man at the helm again: it was his first thriller since the 1994 GLI OCCHI DENTRO giallo.
