I warn you here: I chose to believe critics who said it was not an action film in the usual sense of the word, but rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it that way and all will go well. <br /> <I am here to tell you they were wrong. Completely false. <br /> <br /> Well no, not completely; it's very disappointing if you're looking for an action movie, they were right about it. But he is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not too bad, I suppose, no worse than usual; but what drove them to throw Billy Zane into all this? Was it a kind of death wish from the producers? A way to make their film a guaranteed flop? In this case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they were really aiming for success, then why not hire someone who can act? Oh, and could just as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. Oh, yes, and a director who knows how to lead. <br /> <br /> As someone who has spent all this mess, believing that it will be redeemed soon, I can assure you that this has never been the case. Too bad, it could have been a good movie.
