First, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere in this movie. What is a film without Sam Niel? Has anyone seen Event Horizon? D-Wars did have potential. A movie about a dragon controlling lizards with rocket launchers sounded good, but it is unfortunately not the case. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking about $ 5 to rent D-Wars, add $ 10 to $ 5 and buy a movie from Sam Niel. Apparently, to submit this proposal, I need ten lines of text. <br /> <br /> - Jurassic Park - Quiet Calm - Red Hunt for October - Skyline on the Horizon - Not Jurassic Park Three <br /> <br /> Overall D-Wars is a pile
