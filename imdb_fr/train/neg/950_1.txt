I caught this movie on AZN on the cable. It looked like a good movie, a Japanese "green card". I can not say that I have ever hated an Asian movie, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror movies of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a huge fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not against a light film, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like that. Well, I'd rather cut my wrist and drink my own blood than watch this painstaking and badly played movie. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki had to add water to Quaalude, because nobody in this movie had a personality. And when one of the characters that DID was trying to act on, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance appeared as forced and incredibly wrong. Honestly, I did not think anyone had ever acted before. The ONLY person who sounded authentic was Brenda Aoki. I find it incredible that it's presented as a comedy because I did not laugh once. What is even MORE surprising is that the CBS morning news calls it "a refreshing comedy breath". It was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous comment must be a fool to think of such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a boring and predictable plot and a wooden game. I actually think that "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better film than this one ... and I'm out of half of the movie!
