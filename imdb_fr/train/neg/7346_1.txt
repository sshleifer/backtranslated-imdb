I feel like I just watched a snuff film ... a beautifully done, tense, captivating and horrible thing! A two-hour litany of perversion in the most basic and inclusive sense of the term, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, living burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption whatsoever. And I had fun. I could not stop looking. What does it say about me, about the people who play and act in these kinds of things, and about a world that has become so insensitive that true snuff films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritanical nor humorless, I'm not trying to hide from the darkness, and I certainly have not lived a protected life, but I'm ashamed of myself. AND I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​dragging the sewers, as my own tribe does. It does not have to be comfortable, but does it have to fall into vicarious sadism?
