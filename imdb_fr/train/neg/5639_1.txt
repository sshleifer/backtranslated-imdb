I saw this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I guess the critics were seduced by Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It's certainly the slowest movie I've ever seen with many empty and ridiculously long scenes. Besides defoe who was decent, the game of the other two people in the movie, including Defoe's wife, Giada, was ridiculously horrible (the way they threw the role of saleswoman at the bakery is beyond me) . This movie is quite a plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that provoked reactions in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere, as if to add a kind of shocking value to the monotony of this film. Sorry to be so hard, but this movie is really a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate the good independent cinema, but this film is not worthy of the time of the movie-goers.
