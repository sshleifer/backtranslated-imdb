Maybe I'm not a sophistic. This and Closer are two of the supposedly more cerebral films I've seen recently, and both of them are suffering exactly the same problem in an atrocious way. The dialogue is false false wrong. Nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems credible. Maybe the way this film is designed is supposed to feel, but it was unassailable. And boring. I went out after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I will stay with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen package. If I ever meet this on the teevee, I'll look back and try to find an episode of Quincy instead.
