This is an interesting treatment of a fairly controversial topic (read other reviews on this film). Apparently, you like it or hate it and it seems that most people make this distinction according to whether they believe the tribulation and the end times will happen as the movie describes. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its content suites - were made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are exactly there with "Plan 9 of Outer Space" and the acting is about the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Leaving aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add to the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even more frightening. <br /> <br /> This film and its aftermath did not try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation took place then. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to bring in all that "Thief" had done and explain all the politics and maneuvers that preceded it in the Middle East. The net effect was "Thief" had done a much better job on the scary part of the movie, instead of stretching too much to try to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget the politics and watch this movie and its aftermath, for what they are: horror stories. The fact that they may be horror stories told indirectly by God makes them all the more frightening. If that makes you think about it, he did his job - even if you never believe it.
