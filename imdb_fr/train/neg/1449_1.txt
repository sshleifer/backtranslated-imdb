First of all, before continuing reading, you must understand that I am not neo-Nazi, I am just trying to understand Hitler correctly to be sure that no one like him will regain power. <br /> <br /> I already saw that. series and found horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to watch, but is it real? I looked for answers and found one: absolutely not. First of all, Hitler has not been angry all his life. The series shows an angry Hitler, even as a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter. In fact, it is likely that Hitler is actually gay and has fought all his life to stifle this secret. Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to gain power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point that I found in interviews with people who live near or far from him (of course, not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was horrible because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. If you think about it, you will let people like him take power in countries and you will not want it. If you really understand how Hitler managed to gain power and if you stop thinking that he was really awful, you will find politicians as dangerous as he is (of course, remember he was elected) and stop the theme before it's too late. <BR /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is horrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like this, another will run exactly like the first.
