Short version: The seed is not worthless. It's just derivative and inferior. And without soul. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you have never seen any of the movies of the genre of "psychological horror" (vaguely defined), this film will surely make you melt. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The first installment of real animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of brutality on video, and the (only) memorable gore scene that will follow later in the film may be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions in a way that no other movie may have. <br /> <br /> But if you do not have a lot of experience like that. If you've seen the real thing ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, you'll have a hard time staying awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other critics have compared this to the old wicked video. I understand this comparison. Like the nasty video, "Seed" is more violent than a mainstream and less subtle horror movie. But the reason we still know perverts video is not just for the reasons mentioned above, but the ones that are still popular were something special. Let me be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who got stuck had "a soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Burial Ground", in an interview for the new DVD -ish: "... we will never have more movies like these because Today, technology has gone beyond imagination, and technology is cold, so much will disappear, because small films like these will no longer be produced, and today we have some great stuff that is very expensive. but they are cold, and today a horror film like this costs more than a million dollars, these films were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands. " <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison with the horror of the old school as seriously. But Crisanti put his finger on the nail. Even at the most seemingly of their exploitation, the best villains of the video pursued a primitive "truth". And that's where Boll falls short. It's as if he saw the movies and did not understand them. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS about "making a statement about humanity", an obscene torture scene, etc. But it is, as Crisanti says, "cold". Gore is everything CGI. Everything looks like reconstructed scenes from other movies of different genres. And the pace is so slow. A man so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting remark: the one gore scene really made me think of a video game. <br /> <br /> In any case, enough BS. Weak film.
