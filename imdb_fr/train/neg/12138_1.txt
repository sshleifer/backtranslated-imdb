Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID knock out with enough stereotypes of characters for the author to be sued and then shot. You can see a blatant stuntman in almost every scene. Oh, and the actor is bad too. Although I must say that the line: "Sorry, man, I have to take a huge huge dump" made me laugh at my ass.
