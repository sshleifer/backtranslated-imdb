Do not let the name of this movie fool you, In reality, the character of Jake Speed ​​is probably the most lazy hero in the film's history. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from evil lunatics, which he is often not, he rests seriously. This may add to his charm, but in my opinion, an action hero should not "relax" whenever he has the opportunity. In addition, unlike other daring heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. Anyway, this film is basically worthless, the writing is mediocre and the action, when there is, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep were not bad, but that's about it.) So, if you're in the mood to watch a movie that cures insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - it has a hero who not only falls asleep, but also his audience.
