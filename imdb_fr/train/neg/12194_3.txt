The film begins with a voice-over telling the audience where he is and who the characters are. And that's when I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that any movie director has in hand, I really find it a very easy and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice that tells everything. I actually think that voiceovers are a betrayal to the concept of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear a voice that says where we are, what date we are and especially what the characters feel and think. I think a director needs to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the bad introduction, a very striking film begins and continues for quite a long time. The life of a family of the middle class and all members individually is described in a perfectly realistic way. I think the director has the talent to capture real situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom may seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us to situations that may seem abnormal but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer of real life. <br /> <br /> But that's all. After a while, the realism in the film begins to sacrifice the story. I really felt like I had a big headache because of the characters who were talking all the time. It was as if the actors and actresses were receiving the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's really realistic, but the characters always ask "really, it's so", etc., or characters who say "no" or "you listen to me", ten times when not saying it only once is enough to me I have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that the game and book reading scenes are more than they should be. I understand that the play and the film book are very intrigue-related, but I think the director missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
