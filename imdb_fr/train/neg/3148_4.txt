This film, which is essentially a story of a man against nature, has a beautiful cinematography, the lush jungle of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film really does not start. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and is then drawn to the plantation foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of the father of its owner Peter Finch, whose ghost sheds a veil on Elephant Walk, which becomes a major topic of contention between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to recover their traditional path to blocked water when building the mansion in front of their right of way. The animals are unleashed and provide the best moments of action of the photo. Taylor and Andrews have good times as she struggles to stay a faithful wife despite the marital difficulties with Finch.
