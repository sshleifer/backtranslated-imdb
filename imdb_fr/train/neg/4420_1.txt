"All that a good documentary could be"? Yes, if one is deaf, dumb and blind. Everything but the meaning, the mind, the visual style and the interesting subjects. Other than that. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, volken. It's a completely inauthentic film. A documentary adventure without adventure, a war documentary without any sense of war, a camper sending without any trace of mind. It means nothing, looks like nothing, and carries the implicit message that nothing matters. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, if you know of a movie featuring the great Skip Lipman, there will be no culture, intelligence, wit (other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness), nor any recognizable human emotion ?? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie, it's a panic attack! To avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it with toilets such as "Darkon".
