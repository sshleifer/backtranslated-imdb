He has his merit; Morvern Callar is both merit and disappointment. She is so enigmatic, so original. Is it his way of dealing with the pain of a lost being that makes it so remote and so inexplicable? Or is she as a critic called him a revolutionary? Personally, I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern comes off completely. Getting rid of her boyfriend, without thinking of informing the family or using the money he had given her for an appropriate funeral, she selfishly embarks on a trip to Spain. She seems so devoid of any human human greed. The only element that allows the public to see the human side of her is her intimate friend, she goes on vacation with her. Although in the end her friend is jettisoned and Morvern has nothing that binds her to humanity. She might as well have managed to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Even though she managed to give Spain a look as dark and bland as the UK, the director's photos were superb, the light and colors made the film stunning. <br /> <It's a shame that the film does not contain any interest. It's a little over 90 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. They manage to give Morvern the interest to catch your attention but do not do anything with it but do not take it away from you to the point that you do not care anymore about the characters or the movie.
