Just a warning ... This is the worst film I've seen in years ... I could not watch it all the way ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There is really not much to say about it. Horrible actor, unbelievably bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should not be. Just to tell you a scene: the police search Snipes and surround the building with helicopters and cars, she pulls inside the building, but she still whispers that Snipes does not suspect anything.
