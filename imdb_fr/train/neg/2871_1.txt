I rented this horrible film. The worst think I have ever seen. I think a grade 1 class could have done a better job. The worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen bad ones. Nothing frightening except that I paid $ 1.50 to rent it and it was $ 1.49 too much. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the movie is just a trash. The scenes at Slauther House are so economical that the displaced B looks like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is if you want to lose a good evening and some money to rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch space-killing clowns sitting in a bucket of razors than sitting down again through this flop
