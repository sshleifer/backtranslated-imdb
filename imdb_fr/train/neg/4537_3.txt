In fact, I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a camp, and we were not crazy, we laughed. Of course, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the general idea of ​​the film is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book I had not read , but I hope the book was better than that, because frankly, I thought this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went with a group of people from one camp and we were delighted to be there. In addition, I received a glass containing caffeine, but I still had trouble staying awake. The only thing that kept me awake (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) was the shots, which were just as useless. I really did not like that.
