Really! This is one of those movies that you think you've already watched but you have not seen yet. I mean, you do not blame yourself, but it came to your mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and brief; This is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashers ever made. I can not say anything good about this piece of shit because there are barely decent sequences that could say it's done by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are horrible, bloodless and stupid. The plot is pretty good considering that she copied "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, it's not a film as bad as good. It's downright bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but that was not enough.
