Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra in the role of Tony Rome. Here, he comes into contact with a woman who died under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome is quickly hired to find out what happened to a woman. Naturally, it's the woman under the sea. Lainie Kazan, her roommate, finally falls to the ground. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte embodies a policeman and friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame falls on Rome and becomes an interesting hunting scene. That's how bad this picture is if you have to rely on a hunting scene to provide the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays beauty up to her neck in a plot. His game leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired hooligan whose son tries to outdo him. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother asking.
