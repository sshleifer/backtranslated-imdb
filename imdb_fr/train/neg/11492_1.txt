How can a big German TV channel spread such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid all the talents of actors - Even the famous Gottfried John acts very badly - especially in the scene of double murder - what amateurism! The plane of the screen is very, very extended - maybe to fill 2 parts of the film. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, for example. the scenes on the ship with the unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, the sound and dubbing are very mediocre - probably because of different actors' languages ​​- but: other international productions deal with this much more professionally. Tip: DO NOT look - it's a diabolical waste of time!
