Gadar is a really stupid movie because it tells a false story. It's too unrealistic and it's a typical sunny Deol movie that aims to crush Pakistan. The purpose of the film is to deceive the viewers so that they can think that trying to hide their own faults will not work. And all the songs and music in the movie are all bad. It is very likely that Sikhs will love the movie because they are lost. The film is nil and powerful. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, I would like, but the lowest is 1.Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie .Disaster.
