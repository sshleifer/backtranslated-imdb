Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, two identical twin sisters, became famous in sitcoms of the genre "Two of a Kind". I had never seen them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was a lot worse. Roughly, Sisters Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship program, but shortly after starting their work, they are immediately fired for a series of incidents. But the owner of the company they work for, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their work. They gradually prove valuable assets, talented artists (fashion) and help prevent a bad guy from taking power. the company. Leslie Danon with Jami, Derek Lee Nixon with Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin with Dari, Archie Kao with Nobu, Valentina Mattolini with Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso with Paolo and Matt Patresi with Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this movie was designed to go directly to the video, the work of the camera is completely mismatched, and it does not help when you want to admire the views of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to watch. The twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities of the moment. I knew before looking that they were not going to be interested in any way (they are not so pretty), it's a terrible flood of garbage film. Pretty poor!
