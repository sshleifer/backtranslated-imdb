I'm not usually one to say that a movie is not worth watching, but it's certainly a mitigating circumstance. Cornelia Sharpe is one of the real assets of this film. It is rather attractive and the fact that this movie is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is incredibly boring and is virtually nowhere in the movie. None of the characters are even interesting from a distance and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I do not know why Sean Connery agreed to make this film, but he should have let it go. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see this movie is if you're a dice. -hard Sean fan and just want to see everything he did. Keep this one for the last time. <br /> <br /> Well, if by some miracle, you end up seeing it anyway despite my comment (or any other comment on this site), I hope you enjoy it more than I do. Thanks for reading.
