I love Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie because I know he admired Alan King and they would be fun together. I thought I saw all of Billy's movies, but I could not remember this one, and now I know why. It's so full of clich√©s and dummy emotions; you can feel every scene coming (and go!). Billy can not even be funny very often. He is too busy trying to cry false tears or show his anguish at how his father let him down. Alan King himself is quite friendly, as is the secondary plot of being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy goes to his father's house when a serious health crisis occurs, etc., etc. Or that two very busy doctors can simply close their practices to get the job done in Los Angeles. And when the end comes, boy, it's coming quickly! Almost as if the writers had understood that they had painted in a corner and that the only way out was to make a scene of death. Especially disappointing with some gleams of good mood.
