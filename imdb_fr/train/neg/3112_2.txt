Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoilers in this area Normally, I like Robin Williams' films, but this jewel was not one of them. It has been presented as a thriller thriller. The night auditor was anything but. To be honest, there were 6 people at the opening day of the theater, 2 went out, for good reason. The film was in my opinion poorly written and realized. The acting was ok but again, there was nothing to work with. The film is about a storyteller reading a good book about a dying child. However * insert spooky here * nobody can check the existence of children. Williams travels to Wisconsin to try to find the author. However, he receives only a headache and excuses from the boys' caretaker. That's all, that's all. You wait about an hour and a half and the film ends. There was as much chills and chills as a visit to the dentist. The homosexual nuances, or connotations really had nothing to do with history, and the film had a bit of blasphemy, but it seemed to have been thrown away for no reason or reason. In conclusion, I really can not write a decent review on this film because there was nothing, it was as captivating as watching it dry. I gave him a 2 because playing for what it was worth was good and it was not directed by Uwe Boll.
