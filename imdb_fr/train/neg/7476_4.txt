Evil Aliens has a huge debt to the first movies of Peter Jacksons, Bad Taste and Braindead. I must admit I never appreciate these particular films and I say the same thing about it. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration and chooses to steal I lost count of the number of times a great Hollywood film was quoted, including James Alcon Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and blood we show here is not funny either, the end of the film gets tired. It might have worked better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot is non-existent. I can see what the director was trying to do, the homage he was trying to render, but others did the same thing much better than what is presented here. 4/10
