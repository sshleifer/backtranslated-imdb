Where was his criticism of democratic and republican administrations? After all, he served for more than 17 years in a government where his influence was unshakeable. Oh, I forgot the 8 years he was the second-in-command of the most powerful country on the planet. The film is happy to show images of a young Senator Gore who asks why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion of his scientific article, without asking any questions about Clinton / Gore's complicity in global warming. . Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would hurt Hillary's chances in 2008. Anyway, he's a loose politician and a party man all the way through. He offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way of knowing the history of industrial development that has brought us to this point in time. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film spoke much more about Mr. Gore himself than about the real problems our environment is facing. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a campaign movie, shorten it and call it as it is.
