I was China in this movie. I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was a model at the time in Italy and they could not pronounce my real name correctly. So I chose Sheeba, then I added Alahani because he looked like Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I had never played before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" each morning (which obviously were not helpful). They nicknamed my voice (God be praised). <br /> <br /> David and Peter had a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never designed to be taken seriously, it was a tax deduction based on inside information. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the pleasure I had to play.
