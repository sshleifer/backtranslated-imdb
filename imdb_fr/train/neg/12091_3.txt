Well, the artyfartyrati of Cannes may have liked this film but not me, I'm afraid. If you like the type of movie where the shots last so long that you wonder if the actor fell asleep or if the cameraman left for lunch, maybe it's for you. Much of it is like that with short breaks in the field of inconvenience. I did not find it shocking or disturbing, unlike other reviewers, just a bit rude and useless. The only reason I did not give this star is because the game is commendable and the film is pretty well shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend. Much of the film shows only a grumpy woman teaching or listening to the piano, which might please some people. But if you think this is harmless enough, get ready for some snippets of pornography and sexual abuse just to wake up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
