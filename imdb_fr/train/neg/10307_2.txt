The "mathematical" aspect of this project is just a gadget to try to distinguish this TV show from millions of other cops. The only redeeming aspect of this series is Rob Morrow, although his career was probably (unduly) decreasing after Northern Exposure had he enrolled in this film. <br /> <br /> The blindness of the "mathematical" aspect The show is encapsulated in an episode with Lou Diamond Phillips (which confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned). To catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses a theory about "bubbles". So, he gives this long explanation that, if we saw the suspect in places A, B and C, we can use the "bubble theory" to calculate where he might be. He does all this on the board, or perhaps with a stick in the ground (I do not remember). <br /> <br /> Anyway, when you look at the finished product, it basically takes three points and gets a point. just in the middle and said "Ok, mathematically, here is where we are most likely to find the fugitive." At this point, another character remarked, "Oh, it turns out that this is also the cabin where the guy lived." Is it math? It's not even connect-the-f ** k ** g-points !!! This show reminds me of the bachelor's degree in mathematics with which I worked in the banking sector and who had a mathematical analysis to "support" points on which all the others had already agreed, either by a less complex analysis or by the good common meaning. <BR /> <br /> This shows that when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait for them to join the NUMB3RS team at OSAMA ... They will use the calculation, will invoke an air strike in the middle of the mountains and touch Osama without even scratching the five children he uses as human shields ... because that ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> TV show totally ridiculous.
