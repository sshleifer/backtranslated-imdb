Oh my god, my god ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, it was the highlight of the coffin regarding his career in Hollywood. After strong turns in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter, it seemed that Jayne was becoming one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, an obsession with racy advertising and an appearance in this clunker pushed Mansfield aside, namely cheap euro loans until Fox could give up his contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This movie is really diabolical. waste everyone's time except for Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her creaky performance for the poor returns of this film at the box office and, although she suffers a lot in this film, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary is barely setting fire to the screen, is it? After a handful of very good dramatic and comical shootings, Jayne takes ten steps back in her quest for a serious actress by agreeing (simply to appear with Grant) to portray this gaudy and silly threat. Her Alice character is a complete bimbo of cartoons and although she looks pretty enough to eat in a boiler suit, her appearances in the movie scramble your nerves. We all know that Jayne could do so much better than this slag and yet here she scrolls like an award-winning pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
