Stewart Moss plays the role of a scientist on a working trip with his wife and it feels like he was chosen for this role because of his ability to turn his eyes in the head ... imagine the auditions for that ... "can you ... no, it's not quite that, thank you, then!" Anyway, he is bitten by a bat and then he turns into a kind of bat and kills people or ... he does not do it. Because nobody sees his strange transformations, but he seems to think himself that he is changing because his alliance is detached when his hands are transformed into claws, etc. it turns into something until almost the end. This has good locations and a kind of decent atmosphere sometimes but unfortunately none of this can compensate for the somewhat lame history and wonderfully bad acting. A little fun in a "so bad that it's good", but leans more towards just bad. 4 out of 10
