Original, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending about an hour "discovering" the gem of a movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never goes beyond. The film is constantly aware of itself. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief even for a moment. Overdones, obviously theatrical sets, overdones, obviously theatrical actors, overdones, obviously theatrical airships - well, you see the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to be delivered like a mass And it's hard to feel anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townspeople, the stupid pastor, the stupid children - why anyone, especially anyone with the ambition of all their life to go to the seaside (the character of Slater), decides he stay in such a lamentable place?
