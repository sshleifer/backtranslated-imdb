What made the original Killer Tomatoes so amusing was that they were made by people without a budget who were just crazy for a few days ... <br /> <br /> It was something with a limited budget, so much fun. John Astin, of the Adams family, does his best to make comedy, but he is supported by lame actors, inexpensive special effects and ruthless gags. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides to place a pretender on the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and the "fuzzy Tomato" resembling a Gizmo decide to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Direct to Video nonsense ...
