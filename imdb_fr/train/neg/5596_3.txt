A group of models looks for an apartment, and a local real estate agent shows him an apartment. The unknown of the models and the agent, however, is that "the threshold of hell" is in the apartment and, once crossed, the demon "Dethman" is called to kill all those who are on his path. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Although I am the champion of low budget, microbudget and independent films, I can not rent this film. The creators are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts of his acting prowess on the DVD, but I can not understand that. Why make a film in 24 hours if one or two hours of editing make all the difference? And why do you pride yourself on acting mediocre, senseless and causing the bad delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the models are shown in an apartment by a real estate agent. agent. The dialogue is clearly ad-libbed because no scriptwriter could create such an empty diction. The agent, too, obviously does not know anything about housing ... it focuses on aspects of the house that do not interest him, explains the source of heat poorly (did not he she did not see the radiator?) And said that the problem of vermin will be solved when they call "the terminator". Please, write a script - some gaps, that's fine, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> And why did girls move into models? Their career had no meaning in the plot, and this seems to be a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks a character and says something like "dude, they're going to be (annoyed)," which sounded more natural than any other line, although moved because of another bad dialogue. <Br /> <br /> The demon has no meaning. I appreciated the attempt to explain how "the threshold of hell" jumps to random places on Earth (including apartment chimneys), but why not explain where the demon comes from? His journey involves a man whose love is killed by another man. How does it make you a demon? (Also, why do we need all these Victorian flashbacks without dialogue and staring at a field? It was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> The spectacular breaks between the lines were terrible. The character of Sam Bishop was by far the worst, the interviewer not far behind. Does every question require a break, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a break, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only goal was to drag the time ... but I would prefer to have thirty minutes of good broadcast rather than one hour of terrible (and then lose more time by browsing the same credits twice). <Br /> <br /> Who was Sam Bishop's character anyway? He would have "seen" all this and would have been accused of killing the girls, but he was never involved in the story of these girls. So how did he see them? And if he did not, how did he know Dethman had killed them? And if he has not seen Dethman, how does he know that Dethman is the spirit of Apostoles? I was so lost ... was there even a plan for a plot when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part that I found nice in this film was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. It was not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom that I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz was thinking about. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu play), but I wonder about his skills in making films. Although the best part of the DVD is by far the trailer of his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than all that wasted time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have to be so hard. I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just a fun experience and the idea was never to make a quality movie. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is an indication, Diaz can do quality ... so why did he choose to avoid that here? Maybe the world will never know it.
