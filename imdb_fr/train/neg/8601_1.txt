Ok, where do we start with this little gem? Mutant slugs begin to seize a small town in New England (?). Only one man can stop them ... and this man ... it's Mike Brady! Now, if that was not laughable enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The slug footage is called a footage. No matter who attacks the slugs or where they are, the same shot of stacks of slugs flowing everywhere is shown. Do not forget that this singular plan occupies at least half of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game in the movie was flipped, dragged, stole your wallet, hit your girlfriend, killed your dog, BAD. I'm sure there is worse, but you will have trouble finding it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He had to take some evening classes at the YMCA because he was the best of the pack. <br /> <br /> As for the horror? This film should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are slugs to shout. Any upward action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Only watch this movie in an MST3K environment, otherwise I can see significant damage to the brain.
