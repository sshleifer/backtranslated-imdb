Recently, I saw the documentary "The revolution will not be televised", also known as "Chávez: in the coup". At first, I thought it reflected an internal vision of the events of Venezuela's April 2002 coup. What disturbed me, however, was the fact that the tone of the narrative and the music that accompanied it was suggestive and that at no time no critic Hugo Chavez. It's strange, because if a documentary gives an unbiased account of what happened, it should have been the same. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary has many years, a lot of additional information is available on the Internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find, for example, "Chavez's urgent investigation into the coup" - by the 5 companies European TVs that financed the film, presents blatant lies about Venezuela. " It lists numerous planned and unintentional errors and falsifications in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you'll find it). Another interesting document is the video recording of a presentation of the results of the many errors contained in this documentary, "X-ray of a mens". For me, this seems to be a good counterweight to "Chávez: in the coup". It is available on video.google. I urge you, after watching "Chávez: in the coup", to look at "Radius of a lie", then to make an opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were part of (knowingly or not) Chávez propaganda.
