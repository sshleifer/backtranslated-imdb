I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unassailable waste! There are movies that are bad, but the worst type are those that are impossible to watch but you are supposed to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in his day, could not even awaken a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly amateur high school sophomore night marxism. The film is deliberately artistic in the worst sense of the word. The photograph is in a hard grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or out of focus. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
