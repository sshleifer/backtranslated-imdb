The acting was not great, the story was full of simplistic twists and transparent characters. This is the repercussions of the struggle between the voters of the Flemish right-wing bloc on the one hand and the Moroccans living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a sort of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is simply not powerful enough to answer both questions (assuming that it was also the director's question). Some scenes could nevertheless function as a kind of Ken Loach film taking place in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the right-wing extremist party of the Flemish bloc and has to face many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation and it has unfortunately not been successful. Yet this tells a story about a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. The few foreign viewers should watch and appreciate the film and realize that it is not the film itself that matters, but the social divisions that haunt it that haunt Belgium, a country of 10 million inhabitants, in the world. 2000s <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
