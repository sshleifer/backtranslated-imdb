Admittedly, there are many movies far worse than this movie. This movie was not Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I saw them both .. twice) but at the same time, this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator ( yes, even this movie has gone beyond that). Movies like this give Battlefield Earth a Star Wars look so serious. Razzie Awards Lookout, your biggest contest has just arrived in theaters. This film of which I speak is of course Alone in the Dark. I will try to explain to you step by step why this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> I will start by telling you about what was perhaps the best part of this movie (next to the end credits, which played "Wish I have An Angel", the actor. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he has successfully proved that it is possible to act well in a movie worse than drinking antifreeze.Although his terrible dialogue, he had to talk, I got Asked why he did not leave the set halfway, maybe it was because of Stephen Dorff's presence in the film (someone he would like to do but fails) Tara Reid is a bad player, actress but beautiful and that's all that really matters in movies like this, that does not mean that the acting was perfect, it was average, not good and maybe that the only thing in the movie is not good. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack- Except for "Wish I Have An Angel", the soundtrack is useless and a big meda The heaviest is pumped into the ears of the spectator, waving the terrible story (something that I will arrive soon). A long and very expensive soundtrack of 2 CDs is now available for sale for people with a musical challenge. <br /> <br /> The Directing - Directed by Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. By telling us "Yes, movies can get completely bad and this is just the beginning of my deadly saga of terrible movies". At least, it is said that this film is directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told, I would have supposed that a monkey had been removed from the Congo, brought here and forced to decide on how to make the film, on pain of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder stuck on a skateboard and pushed forward until he hit a wall. On scenes where the camera has to stay still, it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it has to move in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> The Producing- Who on Earth is stupid enough to put money for this bomb? I pity the madman ... sometimes. Sometimes I'm happy that he has learned to never put more money in the trash, so dog feces are tied up in a bag. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard - Trying to analize the story is more painful then stuck an ice pick under a big toe and kick a football as hard as you can, but I'll do it still. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 kids go to science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (that's when it got so much worse that I started laughing). Then, he quickly advances many years later, where he is a detective of paranoia. He is attacked by a zombie who can not be killed, kills him and pursues his life. Later, he is attacked by a crazy monster and discovers secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the plot is bad, really bad. The film begins to wait for us to read about 10 minutes, or 100 minutes, of random text on a false civilization called Abskani. The film is not going to have one turn after another, more than the public can handle, more than the public wants to handle, more than the public could ever care about anything. This plot is really bad that even Double Dragon does better. <br /> <br /> Overall, miss this movie. I gave it a 1 in 10 but it's because there is no 0.
