If you saw the 1975 Sholay, do not watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the 1975 Sholay, go see it. But do not watch this movie. This film has all the ingredients that could have gone wrong to make a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays at best a bad psycho (Probably the only 40 minutes of the reel that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch Amitabh play with his character, it would still be worth watching. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason I think Raj's role in Prashant Raj is because he looks strikingly at Amitabh, who was then young. Sushmita Sen is doing well, with grace and makeup. But the price for the "worst performance and any role up to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to degrade her acting to a level that even a high school drama would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to see this movie. :)
