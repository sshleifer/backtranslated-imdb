I had the impression to look again at the Fast and Furious, but with different actors and a plot a little different. I will say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, you will probably find this movie rather entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from Days of our Lives. She is a very good singer, but too bad that they gave her songs so ugly to sing in this movie. I talk about songs about cars; not exactly what you would do here on the radio. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story some life, but in real life, I do not think an average Joe would meet a girl as exciting as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, repair a car engine, and be a lead singer. It's totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another side note: anyone who is willing to bet $ 25 million on a car race is crazy. But it was pretty cool in the end when Natasha stopped just before the finish line and fucked Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This film is for car fanatics. So, if you like fast cars, then I recommend it.
