As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I thought this one would be great - and in terms of the effects on the gorillas, they were pretty good, though - that's the only thing I can write about about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story, but in reality, it is not even close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - which in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our so-called "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal lovers, was a woman who could hardly ensure the welfare of her animals. As far as Buddy is described as becoming aggressive, it was a total fiction and at no time did the gorilla resort to such behavior in real life. my buddy actually escaped from his wooden crate (not a stuffed crate as the film shows) during a storm, to seek refuge and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz to sell it. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoo - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, at the back of a garage for a while with a single bulb for more of comfort, then sold to the seller. Circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown at him until his death (historically, the oldest surviving gorilla to date) before a show in Miami. Also note in the movie that Buddy is getting older but that chimpanzees never get old. (Chimpanzees, by the way, were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as described in the film)
