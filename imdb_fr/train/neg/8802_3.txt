Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but it was really bad. The kind of evil that makes you want to be able to find that moment in your life, the kind of evil that makes you think "what were they thinking of filming this in the first place", the kind of evil that makes you dream By entering In the kitchen, you had another 50 minutes to have a snack during the movie, the kind of harm that makes leprosy more fun, the kind of harm that makes you think you would have preferred to rent a movie from Pauly Shore ... Seriously, I can not explain how bad it was. <br /> <br /> That said, there were some half-amusing laughter, but they are all so LESS Funny as Anchorman. Of course, they tried to make the game entertaining and fun, but the entire sub-plot left to Anchorman and that made it here was really left out for a good reason ... it was not even a bit good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or the United States, a favor), and do not watch this DVD ... it will tarnish the good movie that is Anchorman and you do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> Ok ... I'm fine now.
