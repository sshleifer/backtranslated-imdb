I thought the movie was good in places. At first, it was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The angles of view in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it because they did not fully cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie have not really been good, which we expect a lot in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> the dialoques do not make sense and I do not think they were very spiritual. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogue, but they failed miserably. It seemed to me that there were a lot of scenes between the actors were set for good and have no meaning for the story. <br /> <br /> the entire film presents only the law and caine. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste of time, it's a movie OK, but not gr8
