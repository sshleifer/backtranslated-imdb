Although it's usually a jungle-adventure cheese movie, it has some highlights - the settings are pretty beautiful and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored of watching it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as noisy as possible, playing the eponymous role, a soberly drunk shanghai jungle guide in escorting the rich boy Van Hoffman and his magnificent wife to cannibal country expedition. He never takes things seriously. The shower is there for decoration and Keith uses it a lot - she does not really need to act much. She is not the only woman to show her body and the playful aspects of the film make her halfway to a T / A image. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that draws specific attention, or far from it. Produced to be shlock, he succeeds without too much trouble. A good programmer on cable at 2 o'clock in the morning.
