Something to sing was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while he was in conflict with the Warner brothers. He made two films for this studio B, none of which in Cagney's credits. <br /> <br /> One of the great losses of the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney made so few films that exploited his formidable talent as a dancer. . The two that immediately come to my mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he had never watched anything but his retired musicals. So why did he do so little? <br /> <br /> Well, this one was wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About is about something about a group that discovered a movie deal and discovered it. There are the usual complications of an accomplice studio leader and an accomplice press agent played respectively by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract providing for a non-marriage clause, Cagney and her singer Evelyn Daw get married in secret. We then attend the complication of a romantic relationship in the studio with the lady of the screen, Mona Barrie. I think you can understand where this is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to sing is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a beautiful singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the music numbers as they were. I'm sure the spectators were paying for their tickets to see Cagney dancing. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving her dance numbers, a dance partner would have been nice. He has danced with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler not available? <br /> <br /> No memorable song has come out. And Daw's voice is so tight. She has a soprano voice of Jeanette MacDonald who was so out of place with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him decent musicals.
