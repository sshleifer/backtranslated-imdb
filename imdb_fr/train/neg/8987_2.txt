The only quality that redeems this film is the current scenario ... Otherwise, this film was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad and the scenography was old and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of all the horrible acts. I would not recommend looking at this one ... The only quality that redeems this film is that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who stars in the soap opera. Part of the editing was well done, but there are errors of continuity everywhere ... I'm just getting tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we have a good soon?
