I'm still trying to decide if this is actually the worst movie I've ever seen - a very disturbing problem in this film is that real scientists are interviewed, but their footage is edited to give the impression that they support the ideas of the film. the many BSers that populate this movie. The descriptive report of the interviews is about ten thousand for one - in the end, the interviewees seem to say, "We want you to think !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on statements like a fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open-minded and want to broaden your awareness, be open-minded enough to read books on quantum theory: "The universe of Einstein", Nigel Calder (A thin volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code", by Heinz Pagels. If you can not bring yourself to read a book, do not complain about "open-minded" criticism. <br /> <br /> To recap, this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <You know what is really a good movie that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Intelligent, sexy, stimulating.
