Well, this movie is incredibly horrible. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. What was sometimes delivered with a slight sarcasm, which leads me to believe that they did not take this film seriously, and that nobody who watches this obnoxious film can not look at it. While watching this "Unknown Creature", I could not help thinking that there was not a lot of budget or competent writer on the team. But, if you just watch it for a laugh, you'll be happy, the movie is not ashamed of making fun of itself, because I do not see how anyone could look at it and be proud of this movie while right out of a DVD that wants to be a thriller / horror action. Fightfest movie in the light.
