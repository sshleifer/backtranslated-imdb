Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it a bit? Having read the book on which this film is supposedly based a few years ago, I can say that there is very little, if anything, in the original book. I went in this movie with low expectations - I knew it would look like telemovie shit - but he did not even manage to satisfy them. <br /> <br /> This is not a prelude - the only relationship he has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it's the story of a totally different character with the same name. They just spit totally against all Carlito's Way fans; add an insult to injury by giving Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original film, a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been shot, no other film will be shot to address the original and intact material of the book Carlito's Way - something I would have really liked to see. I think the same thing about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews of fantastic non-fictional papers and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most dreaded figure, but they have instead made a humiliating film about a strange but strangely pathetic little crook (though Eric Bana's performance was perfect). Now we will never be able to see the true rise and fall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> The three stars are, because, looking at him only as an independent film, it's not so dreadful - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but he could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But they do not understand at all the nature of the underground world at that time (I'm a bit of a crime buff), to which the original movie and the books were right (after being written by Edwin Torres, a lawyer of the time). . <br /> <br /> The fact is, it's not an isolated film, it's perhaps the most disappointing film ever filmed.
