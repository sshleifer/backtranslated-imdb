The first minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a campy charm: they begin with a creepy text extracted from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson tells his future victims in "Pulp Fiction"), continues with two schools of karate teachers from New York discussing the eternal question of humanity (who is the best? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), then Chiba appears, playing himself; he immediately stops a plane and breaks a bottle in half with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or otherwise, is quickly crushed by incoherent history, lack of action for long periods of time, and poor quality of any action. To keep it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There is hardly any fighting. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that are there, are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is glorious. It's only for them that I give "The Bodyguard" a second star out of 10. This film gives an impression of 87 minutes in 5 hours.
