The extremely slow pace of this film was probably the express intention of the director, to show what the life of his childhood in a Chinese village looked like. However, I found the combination of the icy "conspiracy" and the rather impersonal general shoot style to be totally alienating, especially for a Western audience. I sometimes had trouble distinguishing some characters because they were filmed so far. Two hours later, I was totally worried about the past. As a person who is interested not only in music, but also in the history and culture of China (and which is no stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not engage with only one character and I could not find anything to make me happy. . This begs the question: if I did not like him, who would love him? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of any other Chinese director I have ever seen. This regrettable effort just does not fit. I would be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged by this criterion.
