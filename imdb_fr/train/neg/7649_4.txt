Joyce Reynolds seems to be a great girl for the role of Janie, a crazy sixteen-year-old teenage boy in a small American town, who abandons her tough guy for a visiting soldier AND ends up doing the cover of Life magazine. ) all in the same week! Non-stop barrage of jokes, slander, bullfighting and insignificant acts such as Janie's younger sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as maid) constantly stumbling over unholy children, Janie's mother involved in the Red Cross, and Janie's father trying to write an editorial on the problems of today's teens (as parents, Edward Arnold, smothered and without sex, and Ann Coing, talkative , form an unlikely couple, even in 1944, he seems unable to conceive a child much less raise two of them). Named for an Oscar (!) For editing Owen Marks, Warner Bros. follows him in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". By this time, Reynolds was to have passed his cohorts - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
