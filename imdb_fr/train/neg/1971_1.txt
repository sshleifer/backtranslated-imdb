This film is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders display a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in certain parts of the music he brings to the film that makes watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who befriended J. B. Lenoir and who shows their private video footage and tells stories. The introduction of the film subject by Wenders begins in a rather interesting way - alluding to the culture of the world (or even American culture) traveling in space, but his limited view on the theme as well as the reproduction neither funny nor totally fascinating stories of the 30's make this obvious. the film as a simple sleep aid. Yawning. I was expecting more from him.
