I noticed with amusement that in the end, the DP of Detroit is thanked for his participation. The police chief even has a line of conversation that is being played (and boy, can you say he can not act). The reason for the fun is that in this movie, the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of public relations I think a police force would want. Other than that, it's your standard movie of cops and robbers dressed for the 70's with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given the thankless role of a lifelong police officer who can not move forward and who is struggling with a woman with a mental illness. He compensates for this by attending the local pass house. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner who has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase suspects while wearing a trench coat. The film goes on until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why are people who are only guilty of robbery assail a whole police?). Not only do we see a shooting, but since there are four bad guys, we see four. Then, there is a twist that is supposed to hint at what really happened, but let me think how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the band "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I should not have asked myself.
