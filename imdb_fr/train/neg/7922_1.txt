In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It's the natives who love cats. But dogs make war on these people who love cats and they have no choice but to go to Earth and collect food. This is one of the most stupid ideas for a movie I've seen. Let Ted Mikels make a film more incompetent than the already low standard he had set in previous films. It's like he likes to play a Limbo game in celluloid. How far can he go? The only losers in the scenario are the United States. Mr. Mikels and his stupid little handlebar mustache actually have people who ALWAYS buy that shit. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> DVD supplements: Comment from Ted Mikels; the story behind the making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes; Ted Mikels filmography; and trailers for "The Worm Eaters", "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women", "Blood Orgy of the She Devils" and "The Corpse Grinders" ".
