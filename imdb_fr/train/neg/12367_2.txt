Loony Tunes has ventured (at least) twice in the future. The first time was with "Duck Dodgers", an incredibly funny character. Last time was with that ?? um ?? effort. "Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit and could be considered a good product, unless it does not live up to Warner Brothers quality. WB cartoons are known for their cheeky humor, attracting as much attention from adults as children. On the other hand, these episodes of pedestrian superheroes will not fail to convince adults to let them pass. <br /> <br /> The postulate of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals (2 rabbits, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a roadrunner, and a coyote) live on the "planet-city" of Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor hits the planet in 2772. What is confusing is that the section of titles presents these individuals with a count going up to 2772 of the 21st century. Cute, but stupid. <br /> <br /> In each episode, the super sextet ?? in the middle of slightly fun jokes but mostly banal ?? fight various super villains. For the most part, these are types that appear in all series of mediocre superhero adventures and even among the best. Like many mediocre superhero series, this one takes its villains too seriously for the context. And of course, these guys are the only characters who laugh? the usual evil laugh, of course. Why are the bad guys in the predictable adventures of superheroes always ?? ALWAYS ?? laugh maliciously at every opportunity? This kind of animated material seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and (occasionally) their henchmen and / or their property. <br /> <br /> the get-go. The super powers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough shame at WB. Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits that could be described as "insect-like". What we have here is basically the stupid and dull "Teen Titans", including his "animation" look too "modern", but with animals. Feh. <br /> <br /> The other mistake of the creators of the program is (or are) the bad guys. As mentioned before, they are not very imaginative and make a little bad laugh. Surprisingly, the authors totally missed the obvious technique of creating villains from serial WB characters, as well as protagonists. Jupiter Sam could have added to the pleasure? as well as The Fudd, always looking for wabbits? as well as Tech E. Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain? etc. Ah, the sadness of the missed opportunities ??. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this production took too much extra time (ie a 2nd season). Nevertheless, we can rejoice that there is something new for the crowd of 14 participants standing. The rest of us can look forward to a third season of Duck Dodgers.
