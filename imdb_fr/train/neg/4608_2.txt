I bought this DVD because it contains kari and the ratings of the Mpaa say; "R rated for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> that the IMO should correctly indicate; "R rated for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" should be placed after a "comma" and not a "and" because of the resulting difference in meaning. I think that many people who have watched this film will agree with me that sex and nudity are almost non-existent. My first impression when I look at Mpaa's note was that I would look at something like "live" film. that's why I felt deceived. history, after all, who really cares about the story if the magnificent kari was in it. I know I do not do it. <br /> <br /> Of course, that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
