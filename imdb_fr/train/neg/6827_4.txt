Dumb is like a beast, in this black comedy supposedly totally uninteresting. Essentially, what started when Chris Klein was trying to keep a low profile, eventually turned into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", only with no laughter. For black comedy to work, it must be scandalous, what "Play Dead" is not. For black comedy to work, it can not be nasty, what "Play Dead" is. What "Play Dead" really is, is a city full of jobs. Fred Dunst, however, does a fair enough imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's "A Simple Plan" character, while Jake Busey makes a pretty pretty imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
