I really did not expect much from this film, because there are people from Parkersburg WV, in which I play, play. This city is dull and this film is too. There were some decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie might have been a good thing if there had been an acting, but there was none. Unless you are from Parkersburg and want to see what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. The dialogue box will put you to sleep, the acting game will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility after shooting shit like this. It's a predictable film without surprises. What you see is what you get and it's a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
