In the autobiographical tale about the passage to adulthood "Romulus, my father", Eric Bana, of "Munich", plays an impoverished German émigré who struggles to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in the Rural Australia of the 1960s. The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates the wishes of her marriage by shamelessly joining forces with other men. Despite his unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give him a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that it will come back to him one day. It is unfortunately Raimond, of heart and goodness, who must testify to all this marital agitation - and it is his memory that serves as a basis for the film (Raimond Gaita will later become an author). <br /> <br /> Even though I admire "Romulus, my father" for what he's trying to do, I honestly can not say that I enjoyed the game because the film has great performances and serious intentions. this is not enough to counteract the sad story and the funeral rhythm, which leave the audience as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious drama of life is one thing, but this infernal shift in adultery, madness and multiple suicides (not to mention suicide attempts) is another.
