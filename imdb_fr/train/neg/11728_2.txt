I already enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action movies and I was expecting a lot more, even from a 5.8 IMDb rating, the movie fails to entertain and even if the story is lean and without originality, the game of actors is unfortunately thinner and will imitate a "worst scenario" to play "strong feelings" accompanied by a bad action ... Do not waste your time this film is not entertaining, if you want to cry, that may be enough, even if your tears will cry Wesley Snipes in the tragic action movie Wannabe Comedy ... <br /> <br /> I give this 2/10, it was really horrible. If you want to see a movie worthy of the name, go see shooter or rent it, that's all there is better this movie is not.
