The film lacks credibility with helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. The only part of the film to which One can believe that Germany wants to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not done so, they would not have let it wander thus just to reassure the Germans that the landing would take place in Calais. It's not a major thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all that is wrong that makes the film fail. Wrong realization, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) only combine the film to fall flat. In general, spies should disappear in the woodwork. The spy wonders about the suspense by asking whether the information available to him is valid or not, and is afraid of being detected. On this one, this game was finished from the beginning. This spy was doing something other than spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and some suspense may be to read the book.
