I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I watched Cast & Crew's selection on one of his DVDs and I saw "Going Overboard" and decided to rent it. So I went out with some friends and I rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who has not yet reached puberty, he looks to be 12 years old when this movie is out. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this shit, I did not laugh, did not laugh and did not even smile with this movie. In fact, the only time I smiled was when I saw how horrible this movie was. I could not believe how much he had tried to make viewers laugh in this movie ... and it did not work once. Although seeing the horribly horrible angles of the camera and listening to the disgusting scenario, I understood why I had never heard of this movie, ... because it is more bad than ever before. This movie, in my opinion, was the worst movie ever, .... ever!
