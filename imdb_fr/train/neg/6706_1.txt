If I remember correctly, I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival. I liked that, it showed great potential. I imagine that most people here are blowing up the film because the film seemed to stick to each other (the filmmaker's own admission on the official website - the short film was presented as a "draft" ). Nevertheless, it was an easy-going comedy. I think a lot of people are trying to read too much in a comedy. All they are supposed to do is make you laugh - that's all. That's what I did during her screening, so she was successful at that level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
