The only reason this movie is ranked 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a slimmer plot than the period of Cabbage Depression, a dreadful acting game and special effects that seem to come from the TV series "Thunderbirds", it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume. Even by the standards of the 1950s, the special effects are atrocious, with the exception of a few underwater subsea sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects because, with the exception of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THEM !, there was no one else producing effects. It was certainly not a contest for Disney this year if it was their only contest. I would not recommend the film, even to hardcore moviegoers, because the submarine's most realistic scene was limited to a single shot where seawater ran down the periscope. There are other, much better, sub-movies that you can enjoy from this era, such as the 20,000 leagues or Torpedo Run above.
