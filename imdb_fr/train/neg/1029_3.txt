My father is a fan of Columbo and I always hated the show. I always say my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he continues to watch it. It's his right as an American, I suppose. But my senses were granted to the series when I discovered that Spielberg had directed the first episode. It was then that I was grateful that my father had bought this show that I really can not stand. I went through his DVD collection and added that thing when I came home for a college visit. My opinion on the series as a whole was not influenced, but I gained the respect for Spielberg knowing that he had started as most of the directors of lower rank. And that makes a little dribble until the big fish arrives (take the pun, HA, HA, as Spielberg did, it's like Jesus before he becomes a man, or at least what I think it could give you a Columbo fan you would most probably like, even if it contains little Peter Falk.I attribute it to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and that no one yet knew where to go with this episode.This episode is mainly devoted to the crime culprit instead of Columbo's investigation, as would many subsequent episodes.
