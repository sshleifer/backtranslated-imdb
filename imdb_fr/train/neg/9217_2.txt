Yes, the only thing this film is memorable is that it featured a young Tom Hanks who, a few years later, would be a Hollywood star. Here, however, it's not a film that will showcase his talents, and the only other thing that could be considered somewhat amusing about this film is the scene where he thinks he's seeing a monster and directing a guy. Yes, this movie focuses on the ills of playing a game that brings a group of people to use their imagination and try to create interesting scenarios. Basically, a guy after school special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons is cleverly renamed here under the name of Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the directors of this film thought that nerds should not have fun, unless they go out drinking drugs, drink drugs, have a lot of unprotected sex and harass other weaker kids like all popular children. No, these bad guys were playing a game that required one, the brain, no! Not that, if they have a brain, they may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. Granted, this could be a movie about drug addiction, but there are far fewer people who have died carrying Dungeons and Dragons in all its existence than saying what drunk driving claims in a month.
