A lethargic direction ruins a fascinating story featuring the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, who plays an excellent role as a woman who joined an extremist group in 1928 in China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and found an ancient lovers who now work for Japan. Each style of drama and movement in front of the story is uncluttered by the sleepy director director Ye Lou's style. The characters look at each other for long minutes without saying anything, the portable cameras are forever on the faces showing endless reactions much longer than necessary, montages repeat that the same reaction is a triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters at the beginning of the story and we receive little new information as the story progresses. Only silence and still images of lovers who do not speak, interact through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy. A very inducing film of sleep.
