As a person who loves hunting scenes and who was really intrigued by this fascinating story of real life, I was optimistic in advance in this film but too many obstacles prevented the good story that it should have be. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duvall and many characters he has played, but his role here is rather boring as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is tasteless and pretty Kathryn Harrold is the real trash. From what I read, several directors have replaced each other on this film, and it's a shame. You can say that things are not going well with the story. I could not participate in the performance of Cooper by Treat Williams. It should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie. It's also a little sad to say that a man who commits a crime is a kind of "folk hero", but I admit that I ended up rooting for him too. <br /> <br /> Everything was not disappointing. I can not complain about the landscape, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this film re-shot and improved, because it's a unique story of its kind.
