This film was a major disappointment for the direction, the intellectual level, the plot and the way he treated his subject, painting. It's a slow movie that's going on like an episode of Wonder Years, with an appalling lack of depth. He also fails to deliver his message convincingly. <br /> <br /> The approach about painting is very elitist, limited to vague and subjective terms like "beauty". According to the authors of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in kitsch-like landscape paintings at Bob-Ross. A good art according to this film can be obtained by applying the basic color theory (as at the primary level) and a lot of feeling. In some parts, the film is offensive, for example at a given moment (it is celebrated by dancing on tables) that the mentally handicapped are not able to feel emotions or express them through painting, their works being by definition worthless, "bullshit" (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the movie could get so high, but again, few people rated it, and they only chose very high or low notes.
