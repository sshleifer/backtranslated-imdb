This movie was really awful. The acting game was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super nerdy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first, I thought it was an old movie. Then I remembered that it was not an excuse! I have seen older movies with better acting and others. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really hectic. The editing was mediocre (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie does not even deserve a 1. I watched it because I was so bored and the movie was hardly entertained me. It was just laughable. The left foot of my dead grandmother could make a better movie than this one.
