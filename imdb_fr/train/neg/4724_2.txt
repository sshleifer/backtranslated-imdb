It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw him at the premiere at SXSW and I was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even talked about it at the premiere. It's a drama, but everyone was laughing at how bad the movie was. It's never a good sign. The only lifeguards were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livian roommates / roommates. They were funny while the rest of the movie was taken too seriously. The fall of the Beatles' words was absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you're one of those crazy and mad fans of Dominic Monaghan, do not bother with this one.
