I watched DVD 1 only. The actual program can contain 10 minutes of quality information. otherwise they are arrogant reprimands of religious people. It's as if director Brian Flemming had only recently discovered atheism and sarcasm, and felt with these tools that he could easily club his opposition. movie. He never comes back on the subject. <br /> <br /> Religious are inclined to ignore skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in an abusive education. The arguments of these victims seem irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The anti-religious will want more data. No need to tell us that religious are crazy, any more than American Jews, how annoying Christmas music becomes in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, Fleming's superintendent Christian Childhood, the school confronts the director with his insight. This seems to be the most honest part of the movie and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-conscious, he might have a good story to tell about his own (past and present). ) relationship with Christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe he could lend his material "Christ never walked on earth" to a more serious documentary maker. I'm not studying Saul / Paul's writings to find out how much this is hidden, but a quick overview of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are pretty good but they do not really support Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and he does not shed light on these other non-Christian religions. Harris also has good interviews (and easily Google'd) on Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
