This is another incredible and sensual piece of the Hollywood dreck. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, as a Snake Pliskin in a suit, convinces me that he was a better 2nd base player. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual usual carton and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Each scene of this squelching is absolutely predictable until the end when Kurt hits Ray with a vase or some one down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make their obligatory embrace at the end of the film, and EVERYONE --- except Russell and Stowe, KNOW that Liotta will get up and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> He does it. , of course, and Russell trains him 10 times with his 9mm, which was ALL useless. This movie might just as well end up with the clubbing scene --- EXCEPT Hollywood gives great importance to unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "improve" the more they get from drooling.
