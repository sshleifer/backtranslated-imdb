Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and that could be a brilliant literature, this adaptation to the cinema is really nil, because it is more to fight against the sleep than to savor cinematographic delights. The story tells the story of an old couple whose son died and lives a life heavily dominated by poverty and whose main character is a rooster who, hopefully, will one day bring money for a fight ahead. I'm in no mood to say more words about this useless, useless piece, just maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but are you sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for that? No thanks.....
