Anyone who said it was better than the hostel is all about shit, trust me, I'm not a fan of a hostel but it's just ridiculous. This is just another shot on a camcorder, directly on DVD, with few lost ideas of your time, I can not believe how many of these movies exist and I have not seen a good movie yet. In the 80s, gastric and horror video films were made without a budget but with a great story and a host of new ideas and especially the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now, they just seem to have been pumped in order to deceive the people who are surfing in Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing it, so I guess these movies will continue to appear. This film is so low on the ideas that it's just amazing how it was done, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so boring that it becomes suspicious. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to envy, unless you seek to make a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst aspect of the film is when a female character points a gun at someone and threatens to shoot him if he does not back up, you can see that she does not even cover the trigger with her finger grip. An absolute joke.
