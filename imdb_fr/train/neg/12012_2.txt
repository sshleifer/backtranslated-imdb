The dialogue was pretty terrible. The plot has not really inspired everything beyond the obvious turn of events. No wonder visually. In fact, visually annoying at times. Definitely one of those movies that you will find easier to finish if you hold a finger on the fast forward button. If you could watch it for free, you have absolutely no other options at the moment and you really like to see the poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you, but I do not think of anyone else. who else I could think of right now. .
