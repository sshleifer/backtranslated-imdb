It's actually a very bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in the films that Collins did later. However, my main concerns about the movie are that it is improbable and frankly boring for a long time. The very idea that a former SAS member joins terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and one can not help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become quite helpless) is crying out for she. The film begins with a fairly powerful scene, then meanders long enough to end towards the grand finale. Overall, I think Who ares Win could have been an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not feature a feature film. Although reasonably successful at the time, this film brought to an end the career of Collins, who in the 1980s made mostly inexpensive and questionable military soldier or soldier films. Too bad, because he is actually a versatile actor, but in the end, Martin Shaw has chosen his roles with more care and his career remains fruitful.
