The film started pretty well. A glowing green meteorite hit his companions, gaining superpowers (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, theft, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, thermal vision and ability to grow tall and fast plants), and fight crime . From there, everything is downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man receives a costume from his mother, fights with resident gangs and has many failed encounters with gang leaders, which serves to prepare you for a disappointing and disappointing day. , and amazing end. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if it was not like watching a boxing match where both fighters are pretending to hit each other while the audience continues to dance. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the film has positive points. It is clearly stated that if you try to fight a gang alone, he will come home and hurt you. It is said that gangs and communities need to see their real enemies (big bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people in a ghetto existence). It also indicates that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work in community, destroy predators that harm them. The only message that is really missing is that voters must make sure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush) are not crooks as well. <br /> <br />
