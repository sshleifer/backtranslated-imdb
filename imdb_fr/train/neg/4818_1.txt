I was about 7 when this movie was released. In the UK, it was advertised on television in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were a hit movie. It was actually the first movie I saw at the movies, and I was sidelined for years to come. The following week, I was invited to see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. To this day, I've never seen it, protesting to have to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could tell I was looking at garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. A disjointed nonsense that should NEVER have been presented to the cinema. However, I had fun reading all these years later that the director never directed, as well as I know. AVOID AT ALL PRICES!
