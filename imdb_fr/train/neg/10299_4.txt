I must admit that I hid this one thinking that something should happen, apart from the corpse in the first scenes ... and his disposition of him. I was wrong. It was a real Betty film on the beach wrapped for the first part by Mordant Morven. I do not care what Scottish girls are doing these days, who's fucking them, what drugs they're taking. Visually, the walk in the Cabo de Gata in Andalusia has been enjoyable and certainly the highlight for me. The nadir was the store for his dead boyfriend. At the end of the film, I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all there is? 2. I see now why his boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I am such a sucker for stuck these things.
