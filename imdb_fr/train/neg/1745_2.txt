The first half hour of the film had a steady pace and featured the characters. however, all of a sudden, everything was happening too fast, ruthless reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very strong for the role played by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall, this film was the biggest disappointment: the film does not do justice to his trailer. save your money and do not watch this movie, look again at Hera Pheri and Hungama! <br /> <br /> summing up: cheap theater show and appearance to the film without history or content, the plot was extraordinarily no Meaning good music of Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! film shot in one piece, the newcomers (female actors) agreed because it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John were totally disappointed, an established filmmaker like Priyadarshan gives his worst film of all time !
