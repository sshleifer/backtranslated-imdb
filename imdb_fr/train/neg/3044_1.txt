It's kind of a strange movie, since Santa lives on a cloud in space and fights against Satan and his henchmen ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> He has real laughs ... if all were intentional is certainly questionable, though. This film is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film rather than "Santa Claus Conquers Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
