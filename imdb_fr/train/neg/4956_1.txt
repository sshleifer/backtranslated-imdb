When this caricature was broadcast for the first time, I felt that the descent would be at least halfway through. I must admit that watching this caricature is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all these years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them literally beat Batman by the penguin who fought like Jet Li and defeated Batman and I watched another episode where Batman was kicked again by the Joker, who apparently used Jackie Chan's movements as he turned in the air like a ninja. Since when did the Joker or the Penguin become a match for Batman? and even worse when they were the counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li at Joker and Penguin Kung Fu. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad that the image of Batman is represented in this show. The animation is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman since my childhood, I can advise you, in all honesty and disadvised, to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon looks more like an aspiring Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I highly recommend Batman's animated series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S - - T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
