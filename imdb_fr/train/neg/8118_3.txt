Well, EYEBOY, I must say that it makes me very happy when someone chooses me and tries to make fun of me, especially when it's someone who seems as smart as you. My favorite part of your message was "But no big bad guy here, kimosabe, I suggest you stick to the movie with a lot of bang bang." <br /> <br /> Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have much action, as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies does not fall into this category and is simply a very bad movie. I do not really see a lot of non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and did not realize how bad foreign movies really were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Maybe if I judge foreign films by a different standard, I might one day see how Secrets and Lies could possibly be one of the top rated films on the BDIM. Hmm ... If it's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
