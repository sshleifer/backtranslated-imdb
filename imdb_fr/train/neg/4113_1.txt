I have to finish watching a movie once I start, no matter how serious it is. This film was breathtaking. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" movements, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to only touch innocent people, the predictable result and the bad actions were horrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friend's apartment and goes from "what the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ???" in like 1.2 seconds .... just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!
