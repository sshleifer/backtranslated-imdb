From the first scene you will notice how much they tried to emulate the very intelligent and powerful "Cruel Intentions" and how well they landed. You will also notice the terrible choice they made by making Robin Dunne the role of Valmont ... Then, in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers in the role of Kathryn and his mother. In other words, if you can forget the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... Then the film continues, you see the cheap romantic story of miles ago and you notice that Sebastian has already met an Anette in the movie. past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... What originality is it for a precedent. Then, it turns into a film of the type 'Wild Things' on a small budget, with a lot of "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. It's not that he's a bad actor, he's good ... he just does not have the charisma that Ryan had. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, is holding on again. But with all the talents of the world, it is impossible to save this trash. All in all, this "movie" looks like an episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could not they at least leave that one ?! You will want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, look at Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons.
