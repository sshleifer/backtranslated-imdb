I do not think I've been so overwhelmed by the absolute absurdity of a film in my life as I was when I came out of this shit. Nothing in this sense makes sense. none of this is smart or well thought out. for lack of really suspenseful moments, they repeatedly use this total trick of building the music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing a curtain without anything there. it's nice to do it once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things that have been thrown for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed stories ... the characters were not well developed at all. the end was ... bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every element of this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you of all this.
