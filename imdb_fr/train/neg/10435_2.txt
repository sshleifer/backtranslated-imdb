With these people simulating so many shots, using old images and gassy animals to get out, not to mention that some scenes were filmed on a set with actors, what is there to believe? Old country film is good, but animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these movies. I know that racism is acceptable in these old movies, but there is something else to do to make that couple lose credibility. Represented as airliners, they never flew their aircraft, Martin Johnson was an ex-Vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while imposing copyright, denying the apparent depression of his wife, using it as a cute prop, all this makes these movies unbearable. They were by no means the first to go to these lands, nor the first to write about them. He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's about it.
