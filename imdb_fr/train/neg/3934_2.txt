I was looking forward to seeing this movie and seeing these great actors perform. However, I was sadly disappointed by the script and the entire plot of the story. David Duchovny (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", 04, was the doctor of history who used drugs and lost his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded client. He was assisted by Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Taking Lives", 04, who is immediately attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", 04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and is a man with all kinds of money and relationships. Timothy Hutton seems to be overreacting in most scenes and is completely crazy about trying to keep his gang members from being murdered. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a great support role and represents a real COOL DUDE which is what is called a bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie is beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attract a lot of attention from all men. This film is not the best, but it's entertaining.
