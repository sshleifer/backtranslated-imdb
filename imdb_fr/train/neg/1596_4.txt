Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokémons go down in history. You are lucky to see how good Celebi can be, even if he does it first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also makes an appearance, he did not seem very powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder does not have a lot of strong pokémons, other than this taranitar? Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have improved the situation. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger teacher, Professor Oak, although they do not realize it. Misty, I thought I had it in the end but she did not come near. I saw that in the credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much here, at worst in the series so far.
