Unfortunately, I do not remember the book, but I remember that Edgar Wallace's stories captivated me. This film represents a typically German production of low quality. It does not catch my attention - although the story itself is good, it's just not right. At the center of the misery are the characters too simple and exaggerated - they have no nuance in their performance. Even well known and appreciated German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Areless can not save this poor show. However, there is hope ... I have been told that the movies that follow this one are getting better. So, to conclude, I must say that this film does not deserve the cinema screen but may be enough for an afternoon of idleness
