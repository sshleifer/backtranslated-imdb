If half of the footage in this film sounds strangely familiar to you, it means you look far too much of this horrible Italian cult story! To see you, the notorious demi-god Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, he also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic murder sequences in his own (and more easily identifiable), "Cat in the Brain. " The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, appears in Fulci's latest film and thus makes another handful of murders and sordid moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Massacre" fails miserably as a giallo, as the search for the sadistic killer among a film crew shooting a horror movie is quite compelling and suspensive, but it's still a good entertainment if you are in the cheap horror basket. The incoherent script introduces a whole group of disgusting characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings that Biachi offers is plausible and you can tell the killer almost immediately. What remains to be appreciated are the truly misogynistic makeup effects and the hilarious and awful interpretations of the cast. "Massacre" is slow and almost intolerable with its insane dialogues and photographs totally devoid of bloodshed on the screen, as between the first and the second murder. Fortunately, in the second period, women are impaled on fences and men are stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. Music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned "cat in the brain". This one presents ALL the great moments of "Massacre", and more.
