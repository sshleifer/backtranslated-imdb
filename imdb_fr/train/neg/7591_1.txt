This film is based on John Fante's novel. Could someone tell me why please? I see absolutely no reason for this excellent book to be adapted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic production in Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how could you connect to Ask The Dust (the novel)? -And if you wanted to make this story a movie, why would you make it a romantic melodramatic production in Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is poorly done, and if you read the book and loved it, I'm pretty sure you will not like what Towne did with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you may find a strange cast, a bad acting and a slightly exaggerated cinematography. But you are hoping for the best. I really hoped a lot during this movie. I really wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it's as simple as that: whether you're reading a Fancy novel or not, it's not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic production of Hollywood combined with a bad acting, a lack of structure and - of course - many clich√©s of Colin Farells. time. I saw it. Well. I had to see him because I loved the book so much and I was curious. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for the sweet little mustache of Colin at the end of the movie. So nice ... If he had worn it all the time, I gave him 2/10.
