I can not say that I am very experienced in Mundae's foggy films after seeing only a handful, but it is obvious that it was done with a meager effort, and although he may have been respectable that the filmmakers could tear Tomb Raider-off in a garage, just because it's quite obvious that's what they were doing. The film lasts only forty-five minutes, which is a good thing, because there is not enough intrigue to extend it. It has something to do with a diabolical Nazi scientist (who looks as devilish as a porn star playing the role of a Nazi scientist), a mummy, who is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper and Misty - the version of this film by Tomb Raider, which maintains it for less time than Angelina Jolie in its big budget version. I must say that even in spite of its shortcomings, this film could have been better. There is Misty Mundae to begin with, and even better than that if you ask me, it is the fact that it is also interpreted by Darian Caine, even hotter. The couple embarks on all the lesbian sex that can be expected from a movie Seduction Cinema, to the detriment of non-existent conspiracy, although it is not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a rotten film - but the fact that it's short is to his credit, and if you like a little lesbian sex, you could do worse.
