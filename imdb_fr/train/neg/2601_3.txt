I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it because I like Drew Barrymore and I wanted to see one of his first films. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a girl (played by the young and handsome Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York to Los Angeles to recover from her recently troubled defeat. Shortly after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has a devilish twin = doppelganger, which haunts her. <br /> <br /> The film is rather poor and ugly. The dialogues and the acting make the film not worth watching. In summary, it's just something for fans of Drew Barrymore.
