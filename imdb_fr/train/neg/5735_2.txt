First of all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I guess most people looking for info on this movie just wanted a treat of blood, and that's basically that. <br /> <br /> A plot? There really are not any. It's basically Saw, but in China and in much worse conditions. Jeter? There is not, point. Special effects? Absolutely horrible in my opinion ... There were cuts and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of the amounts, the splash, the color, the texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I think the purpose of this film was brutal shock movie. Now, there was a lot of potential on a bigger budget, but a mediocre storyline, poor dialogue, awful acting, what seemed like camcorder footage and an incredible "gore" made this movie really horrible . <br /> <br /> Some movies are worth a try against some critics, even "b-rate" movies deserve a few opportunities (bloodmarks for example were the most recent ones I've seen against Reviews that were worth it), but it was just awful. I hope that people considering this movie will read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am for brutality and shock, but the general unreality and the really horrible game make it a horrible experience. Save your time / money and the chance of something else, you will not be disappointed.
