Curiously, many people who say that this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a 2 hour MTV video filled with panty, action packed, gore and "Whoopee". Frenetic editing, pop video camera work, cool music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster). .. very well played all round, totally predictable in the stakes "who will die after" and a total gain on the name Dawn Of The Dead which will generate a lot of income for the fans of the original who will go to see it out of curiosity ... </ strong> Do not remakes of classics irritate you? Can they REALLY not offer something original? Why redo Dawn Of The Dead? The elements that made the original special (the middle segment that kids find so boring are supposed to be slow to show how, when you get everything you've always wanted, you're still not happy) are totally absent . This is an action movie, clear and simple. The faster will be the better. If you like action movies (and that the 2004 version is well done), do not hesitate, but if you like the substance of their films, get ready to sigh (again) ... > Look at movie theaters over the next few years as we get The Godfather series redone by the hottest pop director right now, and Star Wars redone, with all the kids saying that the new version is much better than the old version is slow and boring and holds a picture for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will still discuss the Romero version , not this pap
