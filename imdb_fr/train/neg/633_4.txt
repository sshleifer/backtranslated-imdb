The Good Earth follows the life of a slave and a poor peasant in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is excellent, but I hated the fact that they decided to play the Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has an American accent so intense, as most of the main actors do, that I could not stand listening to him speak. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood could not go beyond its racist convictions to launch As Asians. in the main roles. Taking Anglos and giving them the impression that the Chinese look like Anglo-Saxons polishes them on their faces to play African Americans.
