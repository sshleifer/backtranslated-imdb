It's interesting to see how 90% of the high ratings are all made up of "random username *" from "United States" (no state pride ??) that say more or less exactly the same thing with exactly the same grammatical style and all with exactly the same lack of taste in the movies. I would like to deepen this suspicious trend, but alas, it is a critique of the film, not the critics themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a passionate filmmaker. fan. This means that I have seen a huge number of movies, from good to bad, and that I can say wholeheartedly that Giant Faces is, in fact, NOT a good movie. It has good intentions, but does not meet many basic standards (if any) that I associate with a quality cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The acting game: Mostly terrible, palatable to the best. To hear that most were apparently volunteers does not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> The dialogue: clumsy, nerdy, the screenplay comes as a long version of a cheese skit that you would have seen playing at the Sunday School or youth group feature. Robots of the Rave Review delight in the absence of "meaningless words", but the harsh truth is that these words are part of the real world and that their complete absence is palpable. Let's just say that the nasty former head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than "OH NO!" when things do not go as he wants. <br /> <br /> The plot: A breathtaking prediction. It was commented that this film was "not a Hollywood cliche", and yet, it's as if it had been shot directly from Making An Underdog's Sports Movie For Dummies (including the quasi-romantic subplot mandatory for the ladies) and that layer of paint slapped on it. I do not lie and do not boast when I say that I had almost all the important details in the plot and the subplot immediately after their creation. Only a person who has never seen a decent sports film of his entire life would be moved by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> The staging: it too was inspired by the generic Underdog Sports. Movie template. Nevertheless, acting aside, there were not many notable gaffes, so at least Face Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The message: Ask Jesus and he will grant all your wishes. Part of me was hoping that this film would end with the eventual defeat of the team to truly emphasize the whole "If we lose, we praise you" because in the real world you will fail at one time or another and it is good to be prepared for that. But in the Giant Face world, if you fail, it's clear that someone is making a mistake or cheating. Another interesting question is, what happens if the Eagles meet another team that had the religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous games and last-minute backups, or would the universe have just exploded? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: For the conservative crowd of Christian Christians lamenting the ills of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another Christian film at best mediocre to stand on a pedestal as a privileged model of modernity . production. For all the others, the effects range from boredom to a burning desire to look at something else. And a warning: any attempt to show this to non-Christians will not lead to conversion, but to derision. I give these two stars, one for the scene that did not make me roll my eyes, and another for the basic technical skills with a small budget.
