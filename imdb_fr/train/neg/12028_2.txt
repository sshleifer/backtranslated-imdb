I agree with all those above who said anything that might convince you not to lose a moment while watching this incredibly amateurish movie. Very bad game of actors, casual production values, totally pedestrian direction, and a scenario so inept and insane that it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" will apparently be working for pay, although no one should have been paid for this bad job. The quarries should rather have been FINISHED above this drone without consequence. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so breathtaking. And Chad Lowe is terribly and systematically bad.
