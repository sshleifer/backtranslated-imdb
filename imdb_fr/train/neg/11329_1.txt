Elizabeth Taylor was never able to act at all and she was just her usual annoying, talentless in this movie. It was before she became so big but she still looked very short and skinny. Rock Hudson was acceptable as Bick Benedict but it is clear that an actor with a larger reach like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to sneak into a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and lasts too long. The actors were all too young and light and none of them had aged convincingly due to the bad composition. Hudson looked ridiculous just to be stuffed and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
