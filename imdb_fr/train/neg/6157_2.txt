Yeah, it was really one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the chains and came across this fucking movie. For some names in the cast, I would expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham reduced to such a horrible game. I hope the money was worth it. And the students, they talked about fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or as a result of a horrible disaster. I mean, I fought, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even watched this movie was that the remote came under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
