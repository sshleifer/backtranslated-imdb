Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion. People look at her and say, "Oh, what do you know, you were the star of" Theodore Rex "". How could anyone take it seriously after falling down to become the star of this dreadful hogwash? Even little kids would fall for this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of "Sigmund and the sea monsters". In fact, thinking about it, 'Sigmund' was much better than this one. <br /> <br /> And yet, has that been done? By submitting the producer to an illegal substance before talking to him about it? Watch this hideous abomination at your own risk.
