Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the film is as follows: the first lady has her husband murdered because he was cheating on her. That's all. Not detected by anyone, except for Cuba and Angie, she conceives and implements a vast assassination plot of which nobody knows anything ... and escapes completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly hilarious: Standing in front of the president, Cuba deflects the assassin's bullet ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch a film from a press camera and see it ... a clue. They strive to protect the film, believing that they are the only ones to have a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba meets with a member of the presidential staff. The PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba says there was more than one person involved. The PSM then states that the plot includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. God, I wonder if the PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Archer, the first lady, is an outstanding artist. Cuba can not make a painting and she says, "You are too close ... look at yourself ... look at it from a different angle, look from my point of view." Can anyone miss this index?
