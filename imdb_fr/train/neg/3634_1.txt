Boring fantasy for kids that gives Joan Plowright star status, but has little to do. Sappy kids pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while her best friend, Hazel, shows up at City Hall - she's 13 years old! Totally pedestrian in every way, plus the added disadvantage of the syrupy performance of both girls and baseball boys. Certainly a lesser effort for Showtime --- no limits?
