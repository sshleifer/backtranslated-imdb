The best short films Laurel and Hardy are filled with mishaps, accidents and destructions, mainly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the essential (!) Of the punishment - see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (is it because he's based on a sketch of Stan's father?), boys play it "straight" in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It does not come. It's another boring third-order boring comedy of the third order, reinforced only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display their marked gestures (Ollie's fingers shake, his white eyes, etc.) or their comic abilities. <br /> <br /> The film begins with their escape from the police. Since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and hiding in Colonel Buckshot's house. The premise of "humor", Ollie pretending to be the colonel and Stan posing as the butler and maid are never very endearing. They do not play "Stan and Ollie" in this movie. Their roles could have been played by any of the actors in the pedestrian studio and it would be just as poor. <br /> <br /> Stan could mime and make everything funny, but he does not have the chance to do it. none of that here. He is forced to talk too much to "move" the plot, but none of this far exceeds the ridiculous. We are treated to endless third-rate comedy chestnuts such as the gag to not pronounce correctly the name of Lord Plumtree, the "Call me a taxi! Okay, you're a taxi!" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long customers, and an end without sequestrant of Stan and Ollie as the two parties in a painfully obvious horse costume as they flee their bike escape for two , and James Finlayson continues to make it his silent body takes over and Keystone Kop jumps. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie do a lot better in a sitcom in "Sons of the Desert" (1933), where we can see them do what we love about them - be themselves. In fact, 1932-1934 seem to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this film does not exploit any of their strengths, why bother with that? I have to give him a 3.
