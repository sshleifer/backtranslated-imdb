Finally, I finally saw the remake of last night in London, involuntarily hilarious, without sex and devoid of any humor. I do not really know where to start, while this strange homage amused me, it did not really move me. The acting is loud, there is no original music, the costumes are far too "Disney", there is a ridiculous insert "six months later" after the fire of Nic Cage (who does not did not come early enough for my taste) with Cage in the bear costume had the public suppressing the joy of living, as was the comedy hitting various "bad guys" on the island. It's such a weird remake that I can not believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that the comic book gifts would have done in the eighties, much like their Hollywood rendition of Miner's Strike, very strange!
