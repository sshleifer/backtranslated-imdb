During the Christmas holidays, a group of friends from the college stay at home to help prepare for the demolition of dormitories and their replacement by apartment buildings. To make the job a bit more difficult, a murderous, Chucks-dressed psychopath walks around the dormitory rooms and attacks the group in various violent ways. "Listed by the UK in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood enjoyed a good reputation before first use. The term "naughty video" makes me think of some images of a big explicit gore, violence, sex, etc .: all the things that horror fans dream about. So, after hearing all this information, I moved into Pranks (alt Title), waiting for a suspicious slasher experience. . . and that's what she tried to be, but completely failed. Visually, the movie is not great. The cinematography, gore (except some scenes) and the general direction fail. It's just not nice to watch. The non-original script is missing and often throws random objects without any real reason (like the initial kill). There are some interesting death scenes, including a nice face fade (which can be seen on the poster), but that's about all for the positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is neither cool nor scary, and he suffers from the only major mistake that any slasher film should always avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a film made by a few film students at UCLA for $ 90,000 (which would be more than double that of today's), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a total mess. He has some good things and is quite observable. . . But, like a slasher film that seeks to be at the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . he simply can not compare. Do not expect much, and you can at least be entertained. I hate to say it, but it's one of the few movies I've seen that would be better with a remake. . . and yet they go after great works like Black Christmas. Never mind. . . <br /> <br /> Required horror elements: <br /> <br /> - Sub-genre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are brutally cold killings, and the gore is fine for most. . . but nothing special. In addition, they dismissed some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unattractive nudity (for me), but not much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Nah. The monologue at the end of the murderer made him rather rude. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A fear of jumping or two, but nothing else has been effective. <br /> - Mystery: I guess, yes, but I just mocked enough and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / ten. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
