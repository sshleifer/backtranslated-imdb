You know what kind of film you are training when the main character of the serial killer is transported to an electric chair (in what appears to be a bakery truck), only to collide the prison vehicle (and I do not do this) a tanker of genetic engineering. The sticky substance that spurts it fuses and fuses its DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> However, my favorite part of the movie is a shotgun at the shoulder. the snowman rubbing a poor imbecile in which his hands look strangely like a couple of white oven gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
