Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a television series is turned into a full movie and is ruined by the hundreds of people who watched it. By and large, Duke's cousins ​​Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) of Hazzard County spend a lot of time driving very fast in "The General Lee". But they must organize and prevent the destruction of the family farm and almost the entire city by the nasty "Boss" Hogg Jefferson Davis (Burt Reynolds appointed by Razzie) to make way for a huge coal mine. They get help from their sexy cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson named by Razzie) and his uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while they are being sued by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (MC Gainey of Lost) and the police . Also starring Joe Don Baker in the role of Gov. Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick in alternate Cletus Hogg, David Koechner in Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston in Vice President Enos Strate and Lynda Carter in the role of Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of some impressive stunts in the car, and of course the beautiful body of Simpson (I admit that her legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but when same!), but other than that it's pretty boring. He was nominated for the Razzies of the worst film, the worst director of Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst remake or the sequel, the worst couple for Simpson & Her "Daisy Dukes" and the worst scenario. Pretty poor!
