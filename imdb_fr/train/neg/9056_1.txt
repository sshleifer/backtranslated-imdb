I've seen crappy movies in my life, but this one must be some of the worst. These are two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton of Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson of Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze of Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car on a car trip to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not too happy about his sex life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who is trying desperately to have a baby. . Meanwhile, Roy does not know if his sperm is fine, so he is examined by a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not do it and she dropped after about 20 minutes: "Oh yes, she will get pregnant but her husband can not have a baby. " Spot on, as this movie is so predictable. As boring. And boring. Without meaning. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of the stench of this movie. The two couples left in their big car to Nevada, when they were stopped by 2 policemen because they did not stop at the stop sign. The guys know each other and end up bribing the two officers with a box of beer. Not only is this scene useless and unimportant (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and talking, without ever going somewhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to throw up thinking at the end. Apparently, Roy has NO problems there, so he is the father of the child. How many times does this happen in movies ... try something new! The cheated woman finally forgives her husband and best friend for having this affair and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie is at the end, with some shots of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they keep the camera on for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> We would expect more from this cast (although Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
