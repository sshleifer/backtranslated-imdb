If this is based on the true relationship, as assumed, between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am pleased not to know them personally. It's painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills all the way through the movie while the theme song is played in the floor. Many stupid scenes with stupid people do not make a comedy.
