After a first release of 4 very good titles Eurotrash, REDEMPTION managed to scratch the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO leech anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses in his castle for a small vacation. After some sex games sofcore, girls are beheaded one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There is more red herring in this one than at the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearable. The story is silly and the skin scenes are not terrific either. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this adventure.
