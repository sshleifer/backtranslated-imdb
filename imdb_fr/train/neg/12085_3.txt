There is really no need to start this little review with a synopsis of the plot. I mean it's the hamlet of Shakespeare for God's sake ?? probably one of the best-known pieces ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I arrived at this version of Hamlet as most users of IMDb ?? via Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to judge a film, in this case, I can not imagine trying to watch it without the comic jokes. In a word, this German version of Hamlet, made for television, is sad. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing for me to want to spend nearly three hours. I have said this many times, but entertainment is what I need. And this wrist cutter is far from entertaining. However, I will give him some points for what I thought was a pretty good performance. A 3/10 seems pretty much ok. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet even more acceptable. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is simply the bad movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talkative to allow comedy to have any rhythm or flow. Even if it hurts me, I have to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
