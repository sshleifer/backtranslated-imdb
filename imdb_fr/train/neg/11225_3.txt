This documentary is a reenactment of the last years of Betty Page's career (Paige Richards). Tennessee teasing was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work appeared in the 1950s. It was about fetish pics, bondage and cat fights "girls fighting". Movie Star News's Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) asked Betty what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or "deer movies", but Klaw was nevertheless accused of distributing obscene material and was ordered to destroy it to avoid prosecution. It is not surprising that Betty had a cult that lived up to her career. The girl next door with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figurine dressed or not with fetish clothing would hypnotize for decades. After all, it was said that she had been photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second behind the world's most photographed image, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This film could have been much better; but good enough to generate interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is stunning in itself. The bra, panties, garter belt and stockings do nothing to him. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be aware that this movie may change your heart rate.
