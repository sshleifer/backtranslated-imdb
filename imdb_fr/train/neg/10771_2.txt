I have not watched any children's movies for a few years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when he came out. (Never even seen "Bad News Bears" although in the 70s, I worked for the guys who financed the movie "Warriors", "The man who would be king" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show", among others .) Now, I like watching old or little movies and finding people who have done great careers despite the fact that they are very early in a not so good movie. Only minutes after the movie started, I could not stand it anymore and I was going to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had moved on to bigger and better things. as the plot and the actor did not do the work. And that's it, I saw the name of Wes Craven in the credits as an electric gaffer. He had already created two or three of his first shocks, but had not yet created Freddie Krueger nor made the "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped on this picture. Fred J. Lincoln, in the cast of the cast, was more surprising than "Aesop", a zany character from the movie. F.J. Lincoln, from the '70s to a few years ago, appeared in adult films. It was associated with the adult parody "The Ozporns", and this title is funnier than all attempts "Tigers" of humor combined. Leaving the fact that an adult actor was placed in a children's movie is an indication of how the film's authors had to be asleep while driving.
