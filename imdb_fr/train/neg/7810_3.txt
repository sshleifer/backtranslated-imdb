Against All Hope is a very bad movie, sometimes painfully. This is the first film of Michael Madsen, and it shows, it is not very good in it. Some people might find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes that his life and his family are falling apart and calls a preacher as a last resort. After telling his story to the preacher, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found many religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church but away from it, quite realistic. I also liked the fact that Cecil knows that his life is breaking and that he is seeking help, but realizes that only God can help him. In the end, he realizes with the help of God that he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not done at all. The acting is bad, the script could use a little work and looks worse than my personal videos, but it has a good message. Now it is not because you become a Christian that you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes it and works hard to stay on track. All in all, if you are a Christian, you will understand how this film describes Christianity and if it does not, you may be asked to know more about faith.
