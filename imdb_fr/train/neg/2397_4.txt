Nicolas Roeg? He realized the classic supernatural thriller DOES NOT LOOK, does it? Strangely, the above-mentioned film was broadcast on BBC TV this weekend, which did not favor the screening of COLD HEAVEN tonight. <br /> <br /> You see, it's impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DO NOT LOOK NOW, because they both have the same director and the same structure. For the first third of COLD HEAVEN, I thought they also had The same plot, except that a dead husband had been substituted for a dead child, it is this movie that actually aims to turn around a widow grieved at seeing her late husband run around Venice with a red anorak. It does not happen, but at about a third of travel time, there is a huge rebound, and while it is a critical scenario, it is not explained in depth. In fact very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN, which ruins the film. <br /> <br /> People mentioned the rather poor production values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I had not changed, I would have thought it was a TVM because it was designed for television, up to white capital letters in the sequence of the title. Roeg also tries to inject art house claims through spoken thought processes, but again, that does not help the film. We can not help thinking that Roeg should have put all his efforts into the twists of the plot that are totally on the screen <br /> <br /> Low-cost production values, a selfless staging and a really odd scenario and scenario lead to a bad movie
