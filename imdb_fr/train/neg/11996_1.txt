I have been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this film, she is an excellent actress. <br /> <br /> This film contains six stories. It's a new concept hovering over Hollywood. This is not a new element. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and makes a boyfriend to let reporters take an interest in her. But then, Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and claims to be his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she screams, I get angry. Salman Khan can not play a comic role. But in his serious roles, he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He enters a midlife crisis and is attracted by a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor in Juhi are naturally born actors / actresses. They are tall. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is getting married to Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he is cold-blooded and cancels the marriage. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She is the victim of an accident and suffers a loss of memory. Now she does not know anymore that she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who loves an Indian man but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to this man, but he falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie, I loved him a lot, as he grew up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal who has just been married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to train seriously with her, but every time her family separates. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a good actor, but he's funny! I like his films. <br /> <br /> Now here is the problem. All these stories are not interesting. Making a story from six uninteresting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there, the stories touch each other, but do not matter to the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Loose this woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should do more movies, that role was too small for him. Salman Khan can not play a comic role, but real serious movies. It's written about his life as an actor. This film is void and is a mess of actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you can make a movie with Amitabh. Bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.
