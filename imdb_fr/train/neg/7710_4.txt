"The attack of killer tomatoes" consists mainly of disjointed and badly assembled sequences in search of a film. The plot is meaningless, and the different characters come in and out of the picture without any explanation. Looking at this silly parody, you have the feeling that other comments have captured with such precision: it is easy to make a cheap film of poor quality, then to use the "parody" angle as a pretext for its character inexpensive and of mediocre quality a scene, the swimmers are terrified by the tomatoes that float near them; how far can the "suspension of unbelief" go - even in a parody?). The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
