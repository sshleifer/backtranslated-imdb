First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the work. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman starts doing work for his masters, why waste nearly a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the narrative arc goes nowhere, it just proves that Hackman is under close surveillance and that everything he says or does is known to the masters. Again, 20 minutes. Then more time wasted showing the reunion with his wife. All this should have taken at most 10 to 15 minutes at most, simply to prepare the real action, intrigue and twists. By the time the real action started, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is awesome, as usual, and the other actors too, but it's a first magnitude misfire.
