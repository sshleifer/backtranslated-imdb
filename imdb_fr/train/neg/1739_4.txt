Looking at this lady at Ermine, I wondered what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be targeting Marlene Dietrich. Someone from 20th Century Fox may have decided that one sex is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays an Italian countess of the nineteenth century whose field has been invaded by a hussar band of Hungarian commanded by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. His ghostly ancestor whose portrait is hanging The hall of the palace, as well as the rest of his distinguished genealogical tree, sees no minor resemblance to Doug now and another invader some 300 years ago, with whom she dealt when armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the current Betty has just been married to CÃ©sar Romero and the invasion arrived at a most inopportune moment, before things were consumed. I guarantee that it will give anyone a bad attitude. <br /> <br /> The American news, all healthy, Betty is NOT the actress to do so seductively and mysteriously. Marlene Dietrich could have put that aside, but with Betty, it's flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry, although Doug is as charming as ever and I can watch anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment had an Oscar nomination for the best song. Buttons And Bows had a unique chance to win this win for this woman in Ermine. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch has Grable in mind. You will not do it either if you see That Lady In Ermine.
