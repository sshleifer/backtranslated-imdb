Director Kevin Connor and Doug McClure, the hero of the action / romantic hero, come together in this ghost story set in Japan. They had been a moderate success in the 1970s, with The Land That Time Forgot (1975), At the Earth's Core (1976), and so on. Without the plastic monsters to take away the story, the results are mediocre. The film begins with a nineteenth-century prologue, a samurai husband murdering his wife and lover before committing suicide. A step forward presents the married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan, then in the house where the tragedy took place. <br /> <br /> No surprises as to what will happen next, with the departure of the spirits of the dead taking over the new inhabitants with the family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of lover of the wife. <br /> <br /> Everything roars awkwardly with the elegance and grace of an elephant charging, to an inevitable (but surprisingly disappointing) conclusion. The main points of interest are two low beheadings ("The Omen" has a lot to answer by promoting this scene as a standard horror step), and the love-making scenes starring Susan George , the perverse but extremely perverse. The first is a long piece inspired by "Do not Look Now" with her husband, accompanied by piano music; the second a much shorter entanglement (probably at his insistence) with McClure, both seeming rather uncomfortable. Anyway, each cloud has a glimmer of hope and both scenes show its incredible knockers, so that everything is not lost. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not decide if "The house where Evil Dwells" is hogwash, visible hogwash, or masochistically entertaining. If you're not in the genre, there's nothing here, but for horror fans, there's probably enough to make a rye smile and a sign of respect for the effort to leader. <br /> <br /> BEST SCENE - in any other movie, the big black mechanical crabs climbing in the trees that whispered in Japan would have stolen the show. They are, however, eclipsed by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the girls' soup. Seeing this appearance, she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to tell the beef and vegetables, before pronouncing the immortal line "Ugh - there is a hideous face in my soup" . If that was not enough, the answer is "Come on, eat your soup for dad." Laurel and Hardy remain in pieces.
