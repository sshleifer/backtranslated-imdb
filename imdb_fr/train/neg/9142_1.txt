Just watched this after hearing how bad it was and what I wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative reviews, you will not really understand how horrible this movie is, even if it must be one of the hilarious things I've ever seen! I have never bothered to comment here before, but this shit really justifies it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is ridiculous and absurd. Brother of the main character (Ben or Arthur, I forget what is, and frankly, it's never very clear) wants to end a gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is odious for Christians, but apparently 't. Then there's another bullshit about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force her to marry her again under the threat of a gun. This leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest dialogue lines of all the "movie" - "I do not make sense - you do not make sense! ". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there is the acting game, which is just awful. It must be seen to be believed. My favorite is the apparently defended woman, a civil rights lawyer, who reads her words clearly, while managing to spoil them. Enough said. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There is the vaguely attractive guy and completely gormless, and his boyfriend who looks like this little man from the cartoon bisto commercials. Only bigger. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "film" was also filmed by a person unable to hold a camera, even remotely, and the number of mistakes made is incredible. It all starts with the big fat guy in bed with a pair of boots. Yes. <br /> <br /> But anyway, we all know how terrible this thing is. I would like to highlight some of the most valuable comedy moments that the "film" provides. <br /> <br /> - When the big boy sets fire to the church, then steps forward like a six-year-old girl through the parking lot to escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! No idea of ​​its relationship with the main characters - sometimes they know it, sometimes they ignore it, but it nevertheless appears in some scenes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The stoned lawyer. She has already been mentioned, but she is so funny that she deserves another mention. <br /> <br /> - The dinner of the perverse brothers with crackers he prepares for his guests. <br /> <br /> - The anti-gay potions. <br /> <br /> - The devilish brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end, which I will not reveal because you have to see it to believe it. I warn you though, be sure not to eat on time !!!! The pelvis of the main character / director / producer is nude. It's foul. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see in a long time. Literally, nothing is good with this excuse for a movie, the idiot of a director even manages to turn the opening credits into jokes by writing his own name about 15 times.
