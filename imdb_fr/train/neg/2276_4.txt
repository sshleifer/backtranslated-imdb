CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, students from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the civil war. <br /> <br /> Gregory Hoblit's historic historical drama is obvious - virtuous men are blinded by the conflict - although production looks a bit scorched, despite authentic period details and a cast of newcomers talented (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), placed at the top right by Dan Futterman as a conscientious southerner who takes up arms to defend slavery, putting him in direct conflict with his old friends from the North. The film's emphasis on such a misplaced - though sympathetic - character is particularly courageous, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is effective rather than inspired.
