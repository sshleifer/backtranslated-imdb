I bought this film cheaply at a sale, after reading the back of the DVD case and assuming that anyway, I can not lose, if it was bad, then no loss, he was good, so merchant ... <br /> <br /> Then I looked at him ... <br /> <br /> I'm normally a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he commanded very little presence on the screen, seeming not to do much, even the death of his friend at the beginning, which triggers "action" in the plot, seems to have affected him very little, and his revenge eventual is simply boring and without drama. <br /> <br /> Normally, a film with the theme Grand as Revolution and Revenge is able to capture the audience and convince them to feel something for the characters. However, watching this film gave him the impression of seeing a series of confused and almost random events that are loosely linked to his eventual conclusion. <br /> <br /> At that time, I I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece I saw The scene where the pilot sacrificed himself by refusing to jump from the truck loaded with explosives not wanting to kill any civilian is not so tragically sad that it is horribly horrible and painful, although not as serious as the emergency surgery on the injured girl. The acting was mediocre, the script and story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were not quite that visual. To summarize, there are films that are good, films that are bad, films that are so bad that they are good, movies that are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then, at a completely different level, there is "McBain"
