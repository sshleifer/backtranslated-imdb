Of course, a lot of people really appreciate that, but I found the infantile and reasonably offensive codswallop, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and some memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there is a pronounced dip in the invention later). I do not get along with Monroe - she's supposed to play a silly blonde who's not that silly, but she's just silly. Russell fails to convince when she claims to have never been to a gym, but is otherwise pretty wonderful. The men are incredibly uninteresting, as is the plot. In no case atrocious, but so unequal that, if it is a classic, may God help us.
