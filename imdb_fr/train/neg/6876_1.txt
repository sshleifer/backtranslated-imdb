Yes, it was an incredible condescending babble. We know that the French often have a distorted idea of ​​the United States, its puritanism and its vision of sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And, while some of these preconceived ideas may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the Midwestern town featured in this film seemed real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years ago that his penis was too big? Where do you find that in the world? A juke box in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? A city with maybe 16 people within two hours of Chicago, but without a main gas station, no TV at home, no McDonalds, no children ... A population that knows the intimate details of the other and who keeps coming together as a big family who hates each other. Adult men plant cushions of sheep at the local café, have farms but do not harvest, do not kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with the same emotion ? The liberated Frenchman who will fuck the 17-year-old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too fleshy guy who comes out of her cornfields by the breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower this same farm boy from 17 years? HELP ME! I am so confused and amazed by the absurdity of this film that I do not clearly express how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the primer from A to Z on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I did not ruin it for you!
