The most amusing scene in this film is probably the one where our saviors receive their medals, plaques and everything else. The basic idea is that the police outnumber the gangsters by a million, but they are helpless because the weapons of the wicked are a little bigger. I guess the police ammunition is just bouncing back. They decided to shoot this film in a documentary style with fake interviews and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They speak as if they were armed with newspapers rolled up. Okay, I admit, it's probably always dangerous to be in the fire even when the situation benefits you a lot, but do not worry. And why on earth did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I would say it is very long when you have surrounded them and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they do not hit anything. Then they will buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. And yes, that's it, one of the cops hits someone. The bullet was probably deflected by a lamp post or something. I had a good laugh, I guess.
