... when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) in RIDING HIGH (1950). Recreating Bing Crosby as a DAN BROOKS did not help a "dated" scenario in 34 and even less 50. This sad movie has entire scenes taken from the original with most of the secondary actors repeating their roles, unless they are dead. Although being older does not seem to matter to the director. Neither cars nor clothes in the bottom plates of 1934 do not seem to meet the standards of the 1950s. Even the song "Bingel" can not buy this effort. <br /> <br /> We have evaluated the original and the remake, IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's contact was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. This did not stop Mr. Capra, however. After turning around the 50s in the production of educational documentaries, he ended his career by transforming LADY FOR A DAY (1933) under the title POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Once again, a beautiful cast was left for this IMDb Six ****** Star effort compared to the original eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it's better to stop while you're still in front, just after STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
