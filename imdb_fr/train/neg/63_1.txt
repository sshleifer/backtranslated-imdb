Holy shit. It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All performances are good, but there is no conspiracy. Really! No conspiracy! A group of clowns are talking about this and that and it's your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is senile and continues to ask the same people the same questions over and over again. It's worth the same answers over and over again. I'm pretty sure this film has arrived at six because people think they should like it. Good performance with famous and well-regarded actors, but the current full work is a wet crap. Well, maybe it's a little misleading because the steam coming up from a fresh pile sounds a bit like something is happening and in this movie, NOTHING happens! Bag
