We all know that a movie never does justice to the book, but it's exceptional. The important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially grouped into the same character, most of the subplots and main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely understated, making her look like a much less profound character than I knew in the book. In the book, we learn more about her powers and the important effects she has had on so many people, which in turn was a key part of the family's life. In the movie she was only a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third, by the way, is the son and then comes after Segundo-second-) and its links with that between Esteban and his grandson Pancha Garc√≠a (not his son, who 'he also recognize) is cut in half and its importance is minimized. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental aspects of the book whose film is almost stripped: it's called "The House of Spirits". Where is the house? The story of three or four generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the "big house at the corner of the street", as the novel so often says. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film relegates it unjustly to the background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a tiny and superficial film could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
