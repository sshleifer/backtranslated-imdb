Looking at this, I especially noticed the ad slots. DHL, Aquawhite tapes, Rockstar and more. It's a product placement after another. It's pretty obvious how this film got its funding. The "game" of Jessica Simpson is laughable. Any dick should never have a job because he plays the same lame character. The "story" is only a background for this very long advertisement. I can not believe that this movie was even considered for a theatrical release. The more you watch this movie, the more you are embarrassed for everyone involved. Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, Jessica's cousin, have almost no time in front of the screen. I'm embarrassed to have watched everything. I would recommend avoiding this one.
