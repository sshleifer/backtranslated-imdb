Wow! I remember so many terrible movies that revolved around high school from the early 1980s. They usually had a pretty tense plot and many 27-year-old actors pretending to be students. Watching this movie, I felt a little nostalgic for growing up in the 1980s. However, I discover that this film was shot in 1989? Can you repeat that please! Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, it's just bad. The city is preparing to close a high school and threaten to allow all students to go to high schools downtown. Which is strange, since the students at this school are both rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. One wonders how they can not find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. So seniors will do that. Hmmm, you're collecting $ 200,000 but instead of keeping it for college, are you spending it on saving the high school you're in as a senior? And why would they close an overcrowded school before the end of the year? And ... oh yes, this movie was stupid and shot in 1989 !?
