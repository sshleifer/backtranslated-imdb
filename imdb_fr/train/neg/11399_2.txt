I can not believe I lost 80 minutes of my life watching this awful movie. I was hoping everything would be fine in the end, but I was wrong. The plot was abominable, the acting was extremely poor and the special effects terrible. Even the 2 beautiful girls could not revive my interest for this boring and bloody clutter. However, I can not lie, some of the lines in this movie were memorable, as when the Asian boy said, "I lost my virginity to the baby sitter, so f **** stereotypes" "< br /> <br /> please do not waste your time with this crash unless you are ready or you want to laugh ... maybe that way you can watch it rip this movie with friends
