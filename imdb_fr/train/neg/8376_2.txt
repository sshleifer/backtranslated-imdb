"Little Man", now on DVD, is a failure of Wayans Brothers. This is the story of a criminal smaller than a midget played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a woman's handbag after a robbery. He and his partner Tracy Morgan are developing the great plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant it at the lady's house. It then goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" as a chaos to recover the jewel and be treated like a baby. I was surprised at how weak the humor was in this movie. The jokes have been made in other places so often, that they are neither cute nor funny. I almost think the film could have been funnier if they did not use CGI and used the little actor on which Marlon's face was stuck. Looking at the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in the manner of Mini-me, but they chose a different route. Some cameos and Tracy Morgan make fun scenes .. Spend your $ rent on Borat if you really want to laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
