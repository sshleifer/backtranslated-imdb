It's easily the worst Ridley Scott movie. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally absurd in a hyper-aggressive movie about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene that convinces in any way. It's really not difficult to make a movie like this. Everything the crew did could have been an idea of ​​anyone. Writers did not have much inspiration either; a lot of stupid dialogues that made no sense; and a brainless action. I highly recommend staying away from this garbage. I hope that the many talented people involved in this project realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention and that they will work in the future on more honorable and smarter films than this useless mess.
