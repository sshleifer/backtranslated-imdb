This film was part of one of my 10 most terrible movies. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute where there was no fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for the characters to grow, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except with the big machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The scenes were flagrantly stolen in other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen in the last scene of the former Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> At first, the spider machine was exactly like Frodo attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both movies) and wait ...... he hypnotizes his victim and wrap him ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br />> And the theme of the machine against humans was the matrix ... or the terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are other examples, but why lose time? And someone will tell me with the Nazis?!?! The Nazis ???? <br /> <br /> There was a juvenile story thrown to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and it was not much of one. <br /> <br /> Just horrible. A real disappointment for the least. Save your money.
