Yesterday, I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst film she has ever seen ... Since I found it awful, it made me think - what movie was the worst movie I have ever seen and it was the only movie that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not seen it for two years, but I remember Dean Cain's awful mistake of being an arrogant military man (the pretty boy Cain does not very arrogant good). The strange deal with the CGI helicopter, while it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire guys from CGI, but I guess they found it as a free sample of a CGI program or the producer's son. loved playing with his new computer. And what was it like ?? Terrible. And when the dragon walks the halls of the complex then reuses the same plans again and again - it looks VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
