If you have read the book, do not expect much, otherwise, go read it and never watch the movie. It is odd to learn that Toby Young actually participated a lot in writing the script (as he himself claims in the post script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to be aiming to make a rather provocative and entertaining film that combines philosophical ideas with a funny and simple sarcasm and simplifies it to understand it - it reaches with perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes that suit a sitcom and have lost any useful message it could have. <br /> <br /> You'd better not see him.
