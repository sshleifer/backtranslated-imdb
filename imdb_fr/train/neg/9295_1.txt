I was very surprised by the seriousness of this film. A beautiful cinematography and beautiful landscapes can not lead the film so far. I was hoping for a recovery from Hero, but it's much worse. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why kung-fu movies have acquired a bad reputation. No credible characters (even in the world of cartoons of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story scraps. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and frustrating because it reminds you to try playing a puzzle game with a kid. Whenever you think your silly battle makes sense, they make up another ridiculous, meaningless twist ("Ahh, you only think you own me with your super powers and your 10,000 ray guns, but I've eaten my plutonium-encrusted vitamins and teflon, so your ray guns will not work and I'm invulnerable against your super powers ... just do not touch anything on infinity PLUS one. ") Anyone who listens because he's having fun. However, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a fight with bad gas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung-fu movie directors, back hurts unless you take CPAP, in which case your kung fu is not powerful, (b) if you fall several times on the back, with a knife, it will hurt you more and do more damage, false death, (c) when you stab your heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China where there is no Kaiser Permanente at the corner of the street, (d) the kung fu fights do not last for hours, while 3 feet of snow fall, and (e) sometimes, it is worth it. explain your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> Anyway, go see Hero again, because at least in his little world, it's understandable.
