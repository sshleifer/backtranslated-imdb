Oh my god, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and so unpleasant ... Remember the hit of "The Natural", where lightning strikes the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs baldly -mouse from ?? The producers of this film used this same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch hit the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use the images of The Natural or did they just hope that no one watching the movie would take it? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, they were trying to escape into the truck. Such an over-action in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad movie, a very bad movie.
