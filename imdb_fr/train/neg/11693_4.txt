A fun concept, but poorly executed. Aside from the pretty good makeup effects, there really is not much to do. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking weeks and weeks to go from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal height to deadly thinness in a few days ... and once he is fatally skinny, it remains practically as thin which seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film has much worse problems than that: cinematography is definitely a low-budget television program quality and, above all, the acting is pretty. frightful all around. Robert John Burke always seems to be looking for a strange imitation of Charlton Heston and is literally painful to watch ... the only thing scary is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this film as high as I am is that once the film enters its last third and the character of Joe Mantegna takes over, the film develops a fun and campfire atmosphere of "cheesefest slaughterhouse", and The wacky plans of the gangsters to torment the totally heinous gypsies are rather fun to watch. The end, so predictable, is also average. Avoid unless you are a King-o-Phile or REALLY inspired by the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp.
