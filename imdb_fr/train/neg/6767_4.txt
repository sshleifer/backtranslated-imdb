I can watch this movie once, but I doubt that I can do it a second time. Slightly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Matt Dillon's fun (think of something about Mary) and the reappearance of a more serious actor, Micheal Keaton. It's not fun to have fun, but it's watchable. One of my main drawbacks to the film is the fact that Herbie has evolved for the most part into R2D2 antics. The effects of headlights on the eyes were boring about the second time in about 30 times they were used and the curved front mudguard was causing me the same reaction. Go see this with your little ones, that is, "one-digit support" and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
