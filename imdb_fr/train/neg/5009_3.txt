It was perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot did not make much sense and the acting was awful. I am a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she is usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this movie. His character, Piper, is drunk for most of the movie, except for the opening scene. On the positive side, there were several moments in the film where the game was so bad that I even laughed out loud. But despite that, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely lost.
