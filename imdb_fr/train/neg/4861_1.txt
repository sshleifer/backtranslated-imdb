In the glory days of the '90s (god rest his soul), you can light up the great Comedy Central at any time of the day and attend the biggest humorous comedy show of all time, Saturday Night Live. It was a glorious show, be it the first Not-Ready-for-Primetime Players or SNL's second golden age featuring the great artists Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... . I was exposed for the first time at MadTV about a year and a half ago and I think I lost consciousness after the shock. How could such a terrible spectacle last so long? There are so many horrible faults. I guess I'll start with writing. Writing, for the most part, is terrible. This is nothing more than the humor of the kindergarten bathroom. The cast, for the most part, is without talent. I enjoyed some drawings, like those of Mrs. Swan and Stuart, and some talents in the series, such as the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, but not as a comedian. Although a few sparse moments, they are not enough, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible horror populated idiots talkative. Miss this one.
