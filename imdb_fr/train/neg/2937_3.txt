An attempt to crossover to appeal to those who do not appreciate the opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. All that is desirable in this film is opera, and one can find a record of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a love affair with a doctor who cures his throat that has suddenly become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Only because he came out so long ago, he is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and is present on the stage regardless of his singing talent. Nothing he does in this film negates this view. His guilt is not to reject the horrible script. Perhaps because big operas can have silly stories, he tolerated this one. <br /> <br /> Who knows, other than the people involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This film is like walking in the cold mud to remove some juicy treats (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways of appreciating the great Pavarotti, and this one is not part of it. Get one of his many opera or vocal recordings and recognize the main tenor where it's best. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst IMDb films if more people remembered it and gave it votes; it would be perfect for a list of singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through the film. Very often, everything goes wrong because of an incompetent acting game or a horrible scenario. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he had not shown such a superb voice. As efficient as he is as an actor (the opera requires it), even Jimmy Stewart could not have saved this scenario turkey. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 3 out of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti singing and opera because of this movie.
