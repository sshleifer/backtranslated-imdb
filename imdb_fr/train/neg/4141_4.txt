Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is that it goes against everything most vampire myths respect. Like vampires walking in the sun. Although some elements make you appreciate how the company produces movies. A scene where a vampire is stabbed and shouts "Ow, it hurts ... It's really stuck." It seems like it is missing scenes but you get used to it after a while. And there are random dream sequences that really do not help the plot. On second thought, nothing really made sense, but I had a group of friends that I watched twice to get the full effect. In retrospect, the fight scenes were awful and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly, as I write more, I like this movie more. But you know, overall, you can not expect a list of Schindlers, but it's a fun watch.
