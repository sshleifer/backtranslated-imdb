First of all, this movie reminded me of old movies I used to watch in religion class at school. It is not a good thing. Basically, it's just a pretentious and pretentious piece of dirt, just like the terrible "Left Behind" series. I am not offended by religious films ... but I am offended when these religious films are extremely terrible. I just wish I could say nice things about a Christian movie, but it does not seem like it's happening anytime soon. I bet if you give the drummers a decent budget, they still can not offer anything good. Just avoid this one. In addition, the fact that the "American Family Association" (essentially Reverend Wildmon's lackeys) transmits this film on its website is another reason to make me hate. In fact, after watching this, I went home and watched my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 Crash. Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
