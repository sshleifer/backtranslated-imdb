Before this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the tricky zombie movie The Notti del Terrore (1981), famous among horror lovers for its unforgettable performance of Peter Bark, a child in the cinema, and the delicious bite giallo Strip Nude. For your killer. None of the films were particularly spectacular, but both were entertaining in their own way (and the fact that they have a lot of gore and nudity did not hurt). Massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite some splashing and the strange task of bare flesh free. <br /> <br /> The story, which tells a series of murders in a hotel where the casting and the team of a horror film during their shooting, is confusing and so boring: when the blood does not flow not and that the skin is not visible, the film is a real fight to pass (it took me four attempts to finish), with countless scenes of unlikely characters who bicker and do very little Warning. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest of the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to complete his mega-gore film Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've ever seen this movie, there's very little reason to bother with Massacre.
