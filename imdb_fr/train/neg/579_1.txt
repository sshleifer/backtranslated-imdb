Listening to the director's comments confirmed what I suspected while watching the film: it's a movie directed by a guy who wants to play a movie. Intrigue is the kind of thing that crazy teens disguise during the "I could write an award-winning book / script / sitcom" phase. An interesting idea is buried in it (probably because it's the continuation of someone else's movie), but it is totally buried under a scenario subscribed, poorly executed and ridiculously unthinking. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible, and the performances uncompromising, but again, I tend to blame the director. He does not seem at all to have consulted the actors about what is required, but instead put the scenario in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to continue. Who knows, with a bit of coaching, these actors could have done better in their responsibilities (say what you like musicians in the movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man ). <br /> <br /> In the current state, the actors have no chemistry. A great opportunity to use the classic sex parallel and vampirism is missed when, to infect the character of Bon Jovi with the vampire blood of his sick co-hunter, he receives a transfusion. She should have bit him. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the movie. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leaders, is inadvertently by the administrators. Originally, he had intended to use this silent sequence as a pretext to expose the plot in a more useless way. So I guess the finished product could have been worse. But not a lot. <br /> <br /> Frankly, over the movies, it's poorly planned, stupid and forgettable. Even if trashy movies go, it's not sexy enough or gore to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody little adventure, but the director left with more than one comedy for all the wrong reasons.
