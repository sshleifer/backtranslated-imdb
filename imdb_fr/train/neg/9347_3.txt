This film goes from a moment of complacency to a moment of complacency, promising to become something interesting. But this is not the case. It's flat, self-conscious, unimaginative and tedious. <br /> <br /> A series of images and fixed sets is not a film, but a calendar. This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo-dramatic socialist documentary ("It's TRUE that it REALLY happened") not only does not entertain, nor does it convince, it does not even work as a social story. Clich√©s mixed with a bad game make this film a very difficult film to finish, the fun factor fading rather quickly. The characters are one-dimensional, never developing to the extent of what one feels for them. The ego of the director is the most important character of this film.
