Well where do I start my story? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends who knew no more than the actors that were on it and it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I understood in the first 20 minutes, what a bad decision I made to go see this movie. The plot was shit, and so the script. The aftershocks were so horrible that the spectators hysterically laughed. <br /> <br /> The distribution could not have been more plastic. Even some scenes seemed to have to be done much more quickly ... as if they were hanging around for no particular reason. Very bad editing. <br /> <br /> In total, this film was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
