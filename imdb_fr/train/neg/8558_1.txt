This film was absolutely horrible, I feel uncomfortable to call it a movie. This is the typical movie "mumblecore", with zero plot and a band of thirty-year-olds aimless, thirty years, stumbling to try to "understand". I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but let's be honest, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of step with cinema, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies of all time. So, it does not bother me if a film is done cheaply as long as there is substance (NO) substance. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is horrible, the acting, the writing (or all that was improvised?) The direction, but above all, the work of the camera was just nonsense. The camera was never logical, there was no coherence. I have to admit that he was a guy I had heard that there was nudity in this movie, so I thought, even if it's horrible at least, there's nudity (yes , I know, I'm a jerk). Well, thanks to the ultra-crappy camera work, you can never really see anything, and what you see, trust me, you do not want to see. This film made me want to vomit on several levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me want to throw up, the filming made me want to vomit, but especially the idea that this film had been praised by legitimate critics, well now that more than anything makes me want to throw up.
