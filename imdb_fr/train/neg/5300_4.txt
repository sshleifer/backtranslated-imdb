I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts around the world and I just watched this episode that started on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think about what was born of this mediocre film and I can only marvel. whoever spotted the huge potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it a wonderful and classic series. That said, this film is not as good as the rest (with the exception of the embarrassing final episode and the condescending British episode). If Columbo had been made according to the original "pilot", it certainly would NOT have lasted very long, nor been watched and loved around the world. In this film, Lieutenant Columbo is dressed elegantly, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged parents and appears to be very aggressive. There is also no chemistry between cat and mouse between Columbo and "the bad guy". Visible, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started.
