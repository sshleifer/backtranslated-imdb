Well, I hated topple me, I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and that little gem is a worthless piece of trash film. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit that I do not like actors in this movie. After my 18 year old son showed me the DVD cover, I thought, "I would not like this movie," but at his insistence, I decided to try, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> about two minutes after the beginning of the film, I turned it off, I was so offended. it's just disgusting. any honest person would be offended by the dirt in this movie. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion, putting your pussy's juice-covered hand on your friend's face so that he knows you've got "got" is above the line of decency . yes, that's how this putrid little movie begins, and I can only imagine that it gets much worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud as a punch. Imagine if you could get worthless roles like this, would you stay in movies? despite the salary, I would not do it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time I'll do it.
