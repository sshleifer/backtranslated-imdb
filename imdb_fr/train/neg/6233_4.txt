Horribly karate / horror trash thriller with loads of graphically bloody violence and gratuitous nudity, and a perfectly absurd and bizarre "plot". It's low-intensity entertainment and inferior entertainment that will appeal to viewers particularly perverse taste, but it's a little happily bad and I must admit that I did not bored looking at him .... (* 1/2)
