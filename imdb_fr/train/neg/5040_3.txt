I read some comments about it being the best Chinese movie of all time. Maybe if the only Chinese movies you've seen contain no dialogue, far away and distant looks and silences, and illegal editing, then you're on the right track. <br /> <br /> A complicated story? Barely. Try juvenile and amateur. Exquisite moods and haunting memories? Barely. Try downright boring and banal. <br /> <br /> It was horrible. I could not wait until it was over. Especially when the best lines of the film are "How are you doing, I'm fine, are you sure?" Wow! What a depth of character. I guess the ceaseless cigarette was supposed to speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I was totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimental "The Road Home" was much better than that.
