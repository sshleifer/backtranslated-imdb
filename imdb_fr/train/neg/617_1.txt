First of all, let me start with a quote from one of my friends who was watching this movie: "This whole film was going to be a challenge, you know, like," Dude, I bet you could not do it. worst movie of all time "". With this movie, they made a good effort to get this title. The effects are of course mediocre. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of stolen pieces in every horror movie B ever made. I guess the actors are supposed to be at the university. Still, some parts (especially at the beginning) give the impression that they are supposed to be in high school or higher. It does not mean anything. The scarecrow killing people is not pleasant at all. (SPOILER: In the end, when they sing Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and Scarecrow both laugh, probably relieved to see that they were on their last stage and the nerdy dialogue.)
