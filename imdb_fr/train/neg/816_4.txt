In the 1970s, WPIX organized "The Adventures of Superman" every afternoon of the week for several years. From time to time, we had a treat when they preempted neighboring shows to broadcast "Superman and the Mole Men". I have always looked forward to these days. Looking at it recently, I was surprised to see how serious it was. <br /> <br /> It did not matter because of special effects, or their lack. It is true that George Reeves' Superman costume was rather bad, the edges of the foam padding making it more imposing, quite visible. And true, Mole Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a fur blanket would not have deceived a ten-year-old child, as the zippers, sleeves hems, and the poorly-cut coat in fluffy costumes were painfully obvious. But these were shortcomings that could be forgiven. <br /> <br /> No, what made him fail was artificial intrigues. Time and time again, Superman did nothing to prevent the situation from deteriorating. A lynching looking for creatures? Rather than gathering the hysterical crowd or looking for the creatures himself, he explains the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR manager. The creatures are stuck? Once again, he remains to watch and speak, but he does not save them until he is shot. Luke Benson, the militant of the city, shoot him? Attempt to kill a reasonable person, but Superman releases him again and again to cause more trouble. Superman had several opportunities to solve the problem, but he never benefited. <br /> <br /> That being said, George Reeves and Phyllis Coates interpreted their characters well, seeming immediately at ease in the roles. . If only we had given them a better script to work with.
