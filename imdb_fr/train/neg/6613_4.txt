I am a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma but I could not believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag is not very close to the real Sholay. This does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create a chemistry between the characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (raj Prashant). There is virtually no scene with more than two people together in the frame. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this film. Ajay and Sushmita were doing their best but they were useless. The modulation of Rajpal Yadav's voice - ineffective and rather useless. Mohanlal has done full justice and proved again that playing is a matter of facial expression and body language. The rest of the distribution was below expectations. The situation of the comedy that has been adapted from the original Sholay fall in this film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the screenplay but because of the controversy surrounding the film, he ruined everything for the pleasure of doing, he did this Aag. But there is no fire.
