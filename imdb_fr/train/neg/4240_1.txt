As we all know, Hollywood loves to change historical events for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, burglars never returned to the bank when they started shooting at Los Angeles police. Yet in the film, we see them come back inside twice! Another example is the number of Los Angeles police officers who were killed near the end of the movie, it's far from the truth! But of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they add a little more blood and courage. Some events have been combined and many major players have played against different people, but that's what Hollywood has always done. Why complain? The only sad thing is that I watched one-hour documentaries on the North Hollywood shootings on TLC that were better than that!
