I saw this film at the New York Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and found it rather bad. The first and most embarrassing was how much of it was pulled; that is, a lot of sluggish and over-artistic close-ups that seemed to make no sense - from a narrative or aesthetic point of view - other than showing the skills of the filmmaker (who, I believe, was also the director ). This film seemed like what a pretentious film student would propose. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but at best was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the distribution went from blah blah to blah. The story itself was for the most part predictable and boring. I must admit that the majority of the audience seemed to enjoy the movie. laughing and sighing all the time, but I did not like it very much.
