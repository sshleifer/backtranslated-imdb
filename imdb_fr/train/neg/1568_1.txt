To call it anything would be an insult to everything else. Some expletives might describe it, but still too positively. Normally, we do not know what kind of waste, but it was so stupid that we can only despair. Would it have been thought that even the Americans and the commercial television channels would have let this room pass? But as the Germans say: Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens!
