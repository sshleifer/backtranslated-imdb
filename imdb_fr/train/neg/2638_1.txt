There is good. There is harm. And then their film, The Sentinel, is a political thriller and one of the worst films I've ever seen. The intrigue of a mole in the secret service is good, but never has a film with so much potential been so completely plugged. Directed with "ardor" at the hands of Clark Johnson, every actor in this movie seems to be working on the autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas seems to be bored here. Honestly, I can say that I have NEVER, in my life, watched another film with so many holes in the plot. The turn is predictable from square one, and the motivations of the character are so ridiculous that they inspired the laughter of the audience. Avoid that at all costs. This is the catastrophe of a film without redemptive value.
