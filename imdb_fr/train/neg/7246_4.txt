Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely brilliant in this movie, but the story is unfortunately half-cooked and David Schwimmer's energy is a bit like a cold porridge. When he closes his mouth and becomes serious for a moment or two, there is a rush of what could have been. Who thought 25-year-olds would be fun?
