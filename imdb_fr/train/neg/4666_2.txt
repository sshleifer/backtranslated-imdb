This film tells the story of a Japanese woman obsessed with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely weird. I do not see any nuance "sensual" or "erotic". The plot transforms a form of ancient art into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes filmed in Hong Kong certainly represent bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I continue to think that "The Pillow Book" is an insult to Japanese culture and the environment of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverse but boring film. Seriously stay away from this.
