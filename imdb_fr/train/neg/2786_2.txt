Okay, I will not criticize this movie in depth. I note the many praiseworthy criticisms made to me in advance and, as I usually like Maria de Medeiros, I have long hesitated to make a derogatory comment - and it has been almost a year since this year has passed. But every time I see this DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner groan. Be that as it may, let the eulogistic voices dominate me! But for other moviegoers like me, beware. <br /> <br /> Expressed in the simplest and sweetest terms, here is my position: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and reversal that served as a backdrop to this film also have a backdrop for a certain period of my life - via the newspapers I read daily in my local Central European pub. At that time, I followed the reports, but I never really understood what was going on. Reporters tended to report either in a non-partisan manner or with a conservatism that disregarded any group disturbing peace or provoking a rebellion against the establishment. These were times when other bursts of excitement swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States. All the problems that I understand perfectly at the time - whether with a dictatorship or not, my newspapers tend to treat the government of Portugal simply the establishment - not as a well-defined "empire of evil", to use creepy terms of Star War. <br /> <br /> So, week after week, I read trouble stories, but I never found a clever editorial that could provide the story behind them, or assess the practices and impacts socio-economic aspects of dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> Thus, by buying this film, I had at least two hopes: finally to understand the details that led to the social unrest and to enjoy a well-designed drama. This film did not give me anything. <br /> <br /> The film presupposes that viewers already have sufficient knowledge and deep emotion about the historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was banal and superficial. <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD of France - "Official Selection Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box shows actors smiling and shaved, head giving the sign of victory in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French might have thought - although it is a shallow "true cinema" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to rent it for his "honesty", but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "A warm look at the revolution" - a warm look? Try to describe the overthrow and murder of Allende with a "warm look"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the full range of reversals and civil rebellions! <br /> <br /> Another criticism: Maria de Medeiros has returned to her country, her childhood and her story. "Garbage, rubbish, garbage! At least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal In Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and a country does not give shape to an empty film I I cling to my old cassettes VHS of Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile, I'm stuck with a zone 2 of the title above which could as well go to the trash.
