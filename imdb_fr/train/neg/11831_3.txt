I do not understand how these animated movies continue to come out, and no matter how good (or bad) they are, people love it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They like pretty much anything that's lively (like most people who have rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I was eager to see the film with its superb cast. To tell the truth, I was bored stupid. It was incredibly predictable and just not funny. There was a couple of laughs throughout the movie and that was it. Of course, they tried again and again to get cheap laughter, but they just did not work. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after watching an animated film, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep halfway. In addition, the children found the animation of the character weird. I have not heard about it since I saw The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type to look for the negative in everything. But the quality is the quality, and like many animated films that they launch there, there are very few.
