I give this movie its accessories as being very well done and reasonably well done. But I could not go beyond the improbability of all this. <br /> <br /> First of all, a game built around the notion of "Russian roulette" which must be filled on time. The big problem is that if you present a show "live", you risk that your first competitor is one who will have the misfortune to shoot the "real" ball. So what do you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that good, you come to the end and the first five candidates survive, which means that number six has the ball and can not get the payment. He is not going to shoot himself at that moment, so it's a little anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People will flinch, panic, dirty their underwear and do things that otherwise would not make a very good television. Too much chance. This is the reason why the "real" reality TV is actually well written and even more closely modified. <br /> <br /> predictable, since it ended up killing itself with no effect.) <br /> <br /> We are inclined to believe that ratings will increase as it unfolds 1 am (unlikely) with the Asian girl token announcing each increase in the notes. <br /> <br /> An update on race and sex. Big surprise: two films (two homosexuals) and two female competitors are the ones who survived. So we end up with the two white men and, of course, the one who buys it is a little less friendly. The purpose of such a show would be his chance, but the guy you love the least is the one who dies. <br /> <br /> the highlight is that after two hours spent fighting for a televised suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and played in this movie, so she has no one to blame, but she herself grows up in consciousness when someone dies What she thought was going to happen She was quickly shot by an angry passer-by (the motives were never explained) and the show was a resounding success Really? <br /> <br /> The problem of the satire of the media is that it must have some basis in reality or must be exaggerated to be ridiculous (like Network) This is neither.
