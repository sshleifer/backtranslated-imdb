The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. For spectators who enjoy surfing the web, this movie will be a huge disappointment, as the total number of minutes of surf sequences barely reaches three. <br /> <br /> The story tells a part of the life of surfers stranded on the beach who do not wait for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. J.C (Sean Pertwee) is an aging surfer who flirts with an engagement with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just when he is about to find the happiness of growing up with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends introduce themselves to him and convince him to go to the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the very end of the film, so much of the story dissipates into a sinuous succession of disconnected beach scenes. <br /> <br /> The acting is rather mediocre. Sean Pertwee had some comical moments, but his role was mostly banal. Ewan McGregor was decent as a drug smuggler, by far the most interesting and strangest person in the group. The funniest performance was probably performed by Peter Gunn in the role of Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continuous visual gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character did not have enough meat to show much acting talent. <br /> <br /> There is really not much to comment on here. I rated it 3/10. It's a real bummer beach.
