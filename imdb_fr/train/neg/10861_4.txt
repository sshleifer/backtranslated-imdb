Maybe I miss something because I've read more positive things about The Man that were wrong that I read bad reviews - and I just do not understand. I like my blacks to have some style with characters who talk, look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence, no matter what you want to call it. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His crumpled and rolled look is about as far away from the dashing and talkative black archetype you'll find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of misunderstanding I have seen in a long time. She's just not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, he is tired and he does not miss surprises or something new for the genre. I could have predicted the result of The Man who was wrong after about five minutes. And this last scene of cat and mouse hunting is simply dull and dull. Ten to fifteen minutes without anything happening will ruin the film's rhythm.
