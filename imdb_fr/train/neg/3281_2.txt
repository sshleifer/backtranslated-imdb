I suspected that the movie was going to be bad. I have been a fan of Duke for a long time. Have three years of the TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. Took the family to see him. I really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase scenes were good. But to sum up, the movie was an old-fashioned version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. Although I can honestly say that the original Daisy outfits were equally revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also be in their graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are an old fan of experienced dukes like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
