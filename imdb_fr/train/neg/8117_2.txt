"The horrible people" should be the subtitle of this horrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, look out the real life window. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things, you have to watch Mike Leigh's awful movie. The characters speak at length, but never manage to communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because Leigh thinks that we are all as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and that he wants to film real life. But we are not, and he failed.
