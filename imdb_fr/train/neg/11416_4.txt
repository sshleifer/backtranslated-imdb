The fact that this film is entitled to the most successful film in the history of Swiss cinema makes me shake my head! It's true, but pitiful at the same time. A film about the Swiss army could be much better. <br /> <br /> The story looks interesting at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to absolve his military training during his stay at the army church, marrying his love Laura Moretti ( Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> The action as such does not really differ from a few recruits getting drunk and ripping into reality. Melanie Winiger plays her part of the mediocre Michelle Bluntschi, personally, I found it rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The scenario contains a comedy associated with a love story that does not work as expected. The romance part is too trashy, and the comedy part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap essay and does not change at all throughout the movie. It's fun for the 12-13 year-old preadolescent, but not for those looking for an entertaining comedy. The humor is weak, except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Flight? Cool! If you want a real comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you do not yet give your military training, and even then do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give it 4 stars out of 10, because Marco Rima is pretty funny when he's on the screen. Not much time on the screen if
