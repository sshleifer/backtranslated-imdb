This is another production from Northeastern Florida, mainly around Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was able to seize the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as necessary to perform the street scenes. The film is beautiful and not bad. Tami Erin is cute but exaggerated. Eileen Brennan is even more tired. Good for small children, or for those who like soft toys at high doses. A 4 of the Miller-Movies formula.
