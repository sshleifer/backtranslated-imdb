... let me count the paths. <br /> <br /> 1. A "remake" of the title that extracts each snapshot of the slasher manual. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely weak performance of all suspense or thrill attempts. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 ranking that ensures no coolness, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is neither scary nor even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A group of characters so written and stereotyped that we could not care. <br /> <br /> 7. Lack of really scary atmosphere (very different from the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A dialogue script that goes beyond the poor - it's a numbness. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (it is difficult to blame the actors or the above scenario). <br /> <br /> 10. A totally inefficient slasher remake, targeting teenagers, who is not brave enough to try to give free rein to his imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood. <br /> <br /> It's a horror fan that will not let you go, save your money. <Br /> <br /> BOMB on ****
