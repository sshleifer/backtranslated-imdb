Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was there and he's already made hilarious movies that made me cry out laughing, are you really blaming me for expecting it again? In addition, the premise, the fun trailer, the involvement of co-star Jennifer Aniston and the fact that it was a huge hit encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my "one line summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason # 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour movie, I laughed for about 5 to 10 minutes ... together, the rest of the time, I sat down and said, "I really should have had ice cream". I admit that it may be a mistake to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he produces films such as "The Truman Show", "Liar Liar", "Me , Myself and Irene ", The films" Dumber "," The Mask "and" Ace Ventura "then produce, in the words of Bruce Nolan, such a mediocre film? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminal. I mean hello! She has been in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she has about four lines to say. False. <br /> <br /> Reason # 3: One Word - Cliché <br /> <br /> Reason # 4: Occasional Deployment of Specific American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite "Sweeps the Week" - is a Clue for the lure of the movie is specifically homemade. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to education - it's a miracle, you want to see a miracle soon, be the miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavy feeling that seems to have prevailed in the United States, but could face increased resistance in markets that keep a little idea of ​​the subtlety. In addition, I always go to school and this statement suggests that all my friends and I are miracles ... or maybe it just means we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this film, there are enough funny moments in Carrey to make you laugh and prevent almighty Bruce from being a total calamity, but it is advisable to start revising your downward expectations. .
