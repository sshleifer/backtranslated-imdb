I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs animated Monstervision on TNT. Even if he could not make this film enjoyable. The only reason I watched it until the end was because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never do anything that serious ... but took all my courage to bear it. It's like watching your great grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... extremely painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the film itself, dipped it in a paint thinner, and watched it, it would be more fun. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the S-Mart Barracks, step back as if it were a rattlesnake.
