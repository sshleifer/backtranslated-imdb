In fact, I saw China O'Brien II before I even saw the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more funny! And more funny = better. If you're a bad movie buff like me, it's an excellent material. However, if you are looking for a meaningful plot, an ability to act, or an aptitude to make movies, avoid it. The best part is the way they filmed all the stuttering fight sequences. Hilarious evil. See for a laugh, see him for stupid entertainment, but whatever you do, see him for free on TV.
