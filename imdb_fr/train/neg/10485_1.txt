A mysterious and comical chance about a cosmetics saleswoman, related to Elvis Presley, meeting Elvis impersonators while she was speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them by her fault. Kim Basinger, an ever-so-attractive and deserving actress, loves to pick out odd movies, but this appalling scenario (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have one iota of good humor. Stereotypes and low-gags are not supposed to be the subject of classic comedy, but even on a shameful and shameful level, the picture is rude and sloppy. If you look, see if you can count how many foreign shots Basinger has at the wheel of his pink Cadillac, his hands still in the same position and a look not bent over his face. Let's hope she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS of ****
