I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, to avoid idealism and to respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda is hardly the first. Zvezda being a Russian war movie, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, a lush score, slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I did not need was na√Øve love without history, unrealistic and ridiculous scenes of war and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film that carefully avoided all historical or political references ( Stalinism, Nazism, holocaust) but nevertheless insulting to our sense of history endnote on the "liberation of Poland". An opportunity missed as a film but apparently not as propaganda.
