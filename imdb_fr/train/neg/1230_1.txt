The words can not describe how this story (and so this movie is bad) is completely stupid! Basinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking? So there is a shopping center and its parking space is totally full. The character of Basinger will buy a cup of tea and wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When she goes out, the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two shots fired nearby ?? Even if she lives there, when she walks away from the wicked, she goes to the most remote and abandoned place instead of the nearest police station or at least one overcrowded place. GO !!! I will not even get into the infamous red toolbox because other people have already done so. And how she kills the weak thugs one by one. <br /> <br /> It's so stupid, without any logic, I can only warn you to look at it, it's a waste of time TOTAL, honestly !!
