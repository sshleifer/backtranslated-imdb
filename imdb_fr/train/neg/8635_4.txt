This is certainly not one of Lucio Fulci's best films. The plot is bad enough, a millionaire is murdered and his mind asks his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with that (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was to wonder why should anyone care? The father is a fool for everyone he has met (including the girl to whom he asks for help), which has made it very difficult for anyone who cares to know who killed him. But no one really looks at a Fulci movie looking for a good screenplay, it would be like watching a porn for incredible scriptwriting and interpretation. His films usually try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore, but even that is missing in this movie. If you're looking for a good movie about Fulci, check out The Beyond.
