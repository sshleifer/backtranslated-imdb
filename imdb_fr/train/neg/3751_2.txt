I am a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Outside the background music? who really defines the mood of the film ?? he misses almost all the qualities that I have come to associate with Lynch's work. Visuals are dull to say the least, and the dialogue is too vague and monotonous to be of no interest. <br /> <br /> It's more like a movie film student trying awkwardly trying to make a film of artistic dogmas than the work. an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur films with a lot of camera work, a landscape, a sound and a much better script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel like watching one of Davids' personal videos, produced during a weekend with friends.
