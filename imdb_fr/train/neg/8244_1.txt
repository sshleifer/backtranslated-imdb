I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way to shock is to see how much it's been made ... and it's just that. It's an hour and a half of torment. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). <br /> <br /> Of course, the main characters get their bloody piece in a negative way, which is basically correct, because it's a horror movie. And I like (usually) horror movies. I have no problem with violence in this type of movies per se. However, all the violence in this film is useless. It's not a show except it's just grotesque. It's so bad that it becomes boring and very fast too. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie (if the above was not serious enough for me) is that they tried to copy Blair Whitch. Project, filming with cheap portable cameras. But (again, that too) is useless. In the "Blair Which", of course, there is an explanation, namely that they are with a camera looking for the witch Blair. In this film, there is no other explanation than: "Hey, we want it to look like Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the film is also a subject of depression. Girls scream so hysterically that often you can not understand what they are saying. In addition, no effort has been made to improve anything, either sound or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap to the euro. home to the worst hard-rock grungy ... <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not look at this in ALL circumstances.
