A friend and I went through a phase a few years ago (a lot) of selecting the craziest horror movies in the video store for an evening of entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of cheap synth is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Among them is a scene where a man is attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (it does not seem so funny in retrospect, but here). <br /> <br /> Outside of that, it's total shit, notice. But if you like movies like "Chopping Mall", it's probably worth a look. Yes, I saw that too.
