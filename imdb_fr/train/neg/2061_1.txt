The only movie I ever went out on. Incredible, since I paid for myself and my date and I am really cheap. But my brain could no longer stand the chaos that piled up, especially since I could have written more funny material while being bound and gagged. <br /> <br /> This film is offensive from beginning to end. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and it's certainly not funny now. But even worse, this film represents the beginning of the end of a sophisticated and very intelligent comedy. It's a juvenile and very sophomoric scenario, and the ideas started in an era (which continues today) where cheap laughter and sexual innuendo dominate the comedy culture in the movies. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? What high school student did not think about that? The beginning of the end.
