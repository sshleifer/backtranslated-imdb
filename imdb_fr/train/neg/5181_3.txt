This is the first Horrorfest movie I watched and ended up thinking that I do not need to see other movies. I was told it was a "horror film thinking" and I must say that if that was supposed to make me think, I think I will think about what will be the splash / blood films in the collection. Do not get me wrong, even the blood in this movie does not deserve to sit down. <br /> <br /> The plot is tarnished by too much art for art. Camera effects and music are mostly irrelevant and the characters are, to say the least, trivial. Many characters and scenes finally seem to have nothing when they start revealing some of the "The Hamiltons" hooks. I discovered who Lenny was about half an hour when I discovered the movie. I was so visually shocked and confused by Lenny's revelation that I felt completely ripped off. I expected that I would receive but they could have gone much further, in fact the whole gore falls completely flat. With movies like "Hostel" and "Saw", you have to be a little better for a film "considered too graphic or too disturbing for the general public".
