This film was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you always had to keep watching. My boyfriend and I rented it and lost two hours of our day. Now, do not get me wrong, the acting is good. The film as a whole has made us furious. There was nothing positive or positive in this scenario. After this movie, I had to rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. His character seems manic and not quite there. Darryl Hannah, although played too much, she does a wonderful job playing on the situation she is in. More than once, I found myself screaming on TV telling her to fight or become violent. All in all, a very violent movie ... not for the sensitive souls.
