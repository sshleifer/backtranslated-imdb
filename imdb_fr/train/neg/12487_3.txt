This film was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I agree with the criticism. This is not a case where the material is not up to the actors; Here, the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were both as big as Davis and Cagney, and look at how It Happened One Night was revealed - a classic of all time. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (which is a good thing for her, it's pretty much the only comedy she's ever attempted!). in It was a night. Cagney, who was an excellent comedy actor, just seems out of sync with his character, Davis. The scenario provides decent lines and gags, but the performance seems more suited to drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem lies in the soundtrack, which, like the cast of Davis and Cagney, seems a light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who has played similar roles throughout his career, has been more skilfully managing very similar topics. In a fairly typical supporting role, Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. Harry Davenport, in a slightly different role, is very good. But in one of his worst performances, William Frawley is pretty irritating. The constant references of his character to fictitious police officers are a poor ironical effort. <br /> <br /> I really like each of these artists, and it's a pity that as a whole, they do not get more chemistry and do not give a better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
