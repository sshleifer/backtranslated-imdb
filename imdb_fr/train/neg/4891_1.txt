I want to clarify a few things. I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies and I am very familiar with art cinema; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> The art films were then really ART; like paintings. People did it to express their inner feelings, without really worrying about whether others understood something. They were beyond commercial values; Just look at an old Antonioni (or the first Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It's an opportunistic film, intended to deceive judges and festival critics, playing a lot of things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> History does not make sense. The lack of water encourages the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A desperate girl steals water from the public restroom. There is also a porn star (neighbor) who tries to make a movie with an actress with whom he does not seem to feel comfortable. There is a romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The mess ends with a sexual (non-pornographic) scene that shocks a lot of people, but I think it's less provocative than what can be seen in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never speak to each other. Sometimes a style of musical number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what happens in the characters' minds. These video clips are really welcome because the previous scene, without dialogue or music, takes only 4 people, even 4 minutes or more, which, in movie times, is TOO TOTAL. <br /> <br /> There is also talk of "the difficulty of sex without love", of "the egoistic spirit of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film was intended to deceive juries and critics of festivals. There are some pseudo-shocking scenes (within the confines of censorship in Taiwan) and many topics are open, but nothing is concluded or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tips have earned the film some important (contested) prizes in film festivals and have allowed it to win an undeserved commercial success (I see the film in France and the theater was crowded). <br /> <br /> However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this film. It's boring and empty; really a fraud to the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better movies.
