Seriously, what is it? Hooper did classic movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this awful movie, what happened? did he dive a little too much into the slot? This film is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to fire things (Firestarter, anyone?) The acting was divine, the plot was nil, and the special effects were extremely bad, they looked like something from the 70s. Van Damme should be delighted that Derailed was no longer the worst movie of all time, and what was coming of the end? he started shining in the blue, turned into a brilliant blue drop, sucked fire from his girlfriend, and the movie ended. WHAT WAS THAT? HUH? when the film ended, I hoped that the DVD would spontaneously fire to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK, OBEY, you'll thank me later.
