Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you stumbling on ecstasy pipes? You were so many. Did you do it for a challenge? Is it a kind of worship? Or did Guy Richie sign up 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before saying anything else, I will say this. It's not because you do not understand a movie that it's not great. You may have had a bad day of work or sat down to watch a movie after a fight with your wife and you were not in a mood. Perhaps there is a more fundamental stumbling block - as if you simply did not have the mental capacity or a philosophical sense sufficiently developed to engage you with that. BUT. And it is a very very big but. The mega XXL the size of an elephant, but to finish with all the goals. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, do not confuse the inconsistency for complexity and do not confuse this two-hour movie for an interesting movie. Really. You may think that you are smart enough. You can even think of yourself as a romantic figure: an independent thinker who defends a masterpiece against a chorus of defeatists resembling sheep. Please do not. You embarrass yourself. <br /> <br /> The revolver is a waste of time for everyone. If you thought about it for a few minutes, you would recognize it too. It was a waste of distribution, a waste of crew, a waste of caterers, and certainly a waste of precious minutes (you can not get them back, you know) from someone who would have had the misfortune to pass through this mess. <br /> <br /> "No, wait," said a voice in the darkness. "You simply do not understand It's NOT LINEAR This means that the story does not go in a straight line, it's actually the complex and subtle work of an author. And anyway - they had planned to FIGHT CLUB when he came out for the first time - you did not hear it? -Because they could not handle the complexity.They eat the humble pie now. bet you hate Lynch's movies too, soha? "<br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a big fan of Lynch. I rather like Memento, so an unconventionally told story does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I only studied it briefly a few years ago, I'm very interested in philosophy. I do not hate Revolver for these reasons. I do not like it because it's supposed to be heavy and bulky, but I treat it in such a superficial and insulting way that it's laughable. I am not a great chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be that of a four-year-old child. I do not like it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "Aha!" shouts apologist Richie. "Guy cleverly pulls his hat on Brecht!" Just maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can not write a decent script for toffee. <br /> <br /> Compare Revolver at Fight Club is really informative. Fight Club has a nihilistic dialogue to the acidic language that makes you laugh. Revolver has a stale fortune cookie that rejects the liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reevaluate everything that has happened. As far as I know, Revolver has several incomprehensible twists that give no satisfaction because ... well, they do not make sense. If you continue to pull the carpet from under the people, they end up expelling you from their home. And then they lock all doors and windows. And they never let you in. Never. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical involves repeating a mantra of fashionable little phrases. Most of the time, they are spoken, but often they appear on the screen with attributions. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way you can marry so realistically something incomprehensible with all the clichés of gangsters tired of the world. In the end it's so inconsequential. You do not care about anything. You understand nothing. You go back home. <br /> <br /> In fact, I liked a little: the stuck assassin who has a crisis of confidence. He is great. But I can not recommend you to see the movie just to see it. There are only a few minutes left. <br /> <br /> Please, believe me. It's horrible.
