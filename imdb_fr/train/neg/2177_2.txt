The first noticeable problem with this clumsy film is its casting. Ann Nelson plays the grandmother here. Three years after that, she would be the star of "Airplane!" like the woman who hangs while listening to Robert Hays pin for Julie Hagerty. I could not get this picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen years old and has problems. He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what is wrong with this family. She first hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a story in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film. <br /> <br /> She and her grandfather bought a cheap camping car and drove it into all the tourist traps of the California desert. The caravan soon has its own spirit, get off the road, etc. Then, big rocks start to rush on it. The elderly couple is afraid, but stay in the vehicle to move the plot. <br /> <br /> Eventually, grandfather suffers a heart attack after stranded on the roof of the motorhome when he makes another unforeseen walk. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother begins to talk to Native American mummies as she drags them home. She thinks she is an author and takes many notes on moldy corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses his imagination to complete the blanks. We see the mother half-turning, but her mental depression occurs off-screen, much like Gramps's heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the patient of resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own story. He thinks Mom is busy (it was done in 1977). Apparently, mom makes the astral bodies of Native American mummies fly in the air. Matt is hit as a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins to behave wildly. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt to the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair and the trio faces invisible (and unexplained) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of stage construction. The only pro here is VR locked in a salt cellar in the desert. In the distance, the couple notices some rocks that roll towards the RV. It's a pretty scary scene that's finally overplayed. When the rocks begin to rush towards the vehicle, the special effects become obvious. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the race car leaves the road and then reignites, take forever. The scenes where Grandpa is stuck on the roof of the RV as he takes care of a dirt road take forever. Mom's conversations with Mom take forever. Matt's out-of-body experiences take forever. This film takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to click on the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As the scenes dragged on, it was obvious that Flocker was stuffing. Cut the fat here, and it would have taken an hour. The last "explanation" that the minds of the mummies were trying to kill those who were close to Matt never holds water. Did they live in the motorhome? The filmmaker never says that spirits are not good at their deadly ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> While I was still thinking about Nelson in "Airplane!", I also thought of other movies. Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one. Boston is terrible as a kid, playing a ten-year-old boy who has a smart line for all those adults who fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Flocker wrote and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the audience uncomfortable. It's not scary and, like ghosts, you can also get away from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is unclassified and contains physical violence and slight profanation.
