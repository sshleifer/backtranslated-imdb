Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to get rid of her Pretty Woman in Cotton Wool character with this fake thriller against domestic violence, but it's hard to imagine that she will end up performing such a powerful and compelling performance (and Oscar win) Erin Brokovich leaning on the back of this garbage. And do not worry, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the dullest thing about it. <br /> <br /> The intrigue has all the marks of a late night made-for-cable, and do not have the impression that it will offer a glimpse of the dark world of domestic violence, because no characters are sketched enough so that you can really care about them. <br /> <br /> Finally, disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts' name above the title, I'm sure it would have totally failed, rightly so.
