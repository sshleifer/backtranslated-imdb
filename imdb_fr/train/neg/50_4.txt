A "horror" film in three parts with a guy in a closed house, imploring the viewer not to "go out" and (unfortunately) telling us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story concerns a young couple in a car accident who meets two psychos. This leads to two completely predictable twists. It's still fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well played and well played. Predictable but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The second concerns a man on the run after stealing a large sum of money. His car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and falls into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, poorly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes, it's too long. Although to act. <br /> <br /> The third is hardly a horror story. This is a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. He has beautiful scenery, a pleasant erotic sensation and a beautiful sex scene. But (still) predictable and not even scary at a distance. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupidly. <br /> <br /> In the end, the first is worth watching, but that's it. Grant it then turn it off.
