What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was correct, but even at first with shit effects to blend into a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in Hercules were better), I knew it would be bad. But the really terrible part of the movie are the dialogues. It's completely incoherent, stupid and stupid. It felt like it was written by a grade 9 student in a creative class and I got a D-. I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had my share of bad and bad movies (I love the series of earthquakes), but this does not recommend it at all. It's silly and the totally atrociously bad dialogues will make you cringe.
