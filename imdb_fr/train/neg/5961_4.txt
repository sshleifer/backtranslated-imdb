Everything was over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheese scams of these old movies. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of the videodrome but in a more nerdy way, as said before. The acting game can go all the way. But it's the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching. The hallucinations are really successful and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone came alive ... You can see how you watch this movie while waiting for what happens next. This is visible to all monsters because there is no blood in it and as said the blood is not there either, but there is nudity for the perverts. I've seen movies worse than this one, I only wished they would make it bloodier ...
