Before watching this film, my expectations were very low and I went to see the cars. Finally, I even regretted going for this reason. The plot is almost non-existent. The development of character is non-existent. There was so much clich√©s and breathtaking cheesiness in the movie that I could only watch and wonder how it had been published. If it were not the exotics, I would not even have attributed to this movie the note 1. A coherent scenario attempt is wiped out by the sheer absurdity of this cult of elite races and laughable characters that make them members . In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and so simple that an average child could predict the majority of the scenario. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. If you prefer to play Gran Turismo HD, you can quench your thirst for sexy and fast cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
