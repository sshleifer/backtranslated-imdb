This sequel is a complete overhaul of the first film. A completely useless movie. Basically, it took only every film of the first film and they did it again in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time. It ends even in the same way as the first! The music is too busy and too interfering, and because it's more like a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. This is not a horrible film, it is not very well done, there are much worse films, it makes absolutely no sense to be shot. The 2006 Omen remake is much worse, and even more useless, so I guess that's the case. If you point a gun on your head and you have to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I would choose this.
