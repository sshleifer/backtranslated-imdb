There are a lot of pretentious people who claim that this is endowed with a kind of magnificent meaning, and that ignorant fools like me do not understand. This obviously means that we have to stick to the Hollywood slags. <br /> <br /> It contains all the artistic clich√©s of the book. I guess the fact that the director is one of the few elected is a good thing. Almost a parody of himself drowned under his own pretext. <br /> <br /> The director of the film (almost as embarrassing) "Ratcatcher" comes back with another piece falling into artistic nonsense; it's hard to understand and it's apparently a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating for its audience.
