Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie made for television. I can not believe Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, the character of Morgan Freeman constantly talks about "pussy" by referring to NSync's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling the women "pussy" is just clumsy ... What the heck were people thinking behind this movie? Too many imaginary holes combined with horrible action, confused camera angles, lame screenplay and cheap background music have made this film absolutely unbearable. .. well ... it's really bad.
