We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white kid and the cute little kid. And we have a carefree housekeeper, what show did a housekeeper like that? Do we have a Brady Bunch messed up? Yay! At first, I found it really cool, especially because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were rated too well. All his raps concerned his family, his friends and his problems. The father was a bit like Danny from Full House. Always give advice. But he was not a maniac. They had a guard for that. Remember? The intrigues were fundamentally Lil 'Romeo had problems, or ... that's not it. Oh and maybe a preteen drama. Yes it's good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
