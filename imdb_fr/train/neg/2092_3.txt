Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the original Cylon story. The premise of the show is interesting. However, writers follow so many stories and close it with too many POV characters, making it a breathtaking story. The plot crawls at glacial speeds dissipating any tension it might have had. In every episode, nothing or almost nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military subcontractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen flea. Unfortunately, his only operational prototype is based on the version of his daughter Zoe, who died in artificial intelligence, who died in a suicide bombing perpetrated by Soldiers of the One (STO), an extremist monotheistic clandestine group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of Commander Adama of "Battlestar Galactica") is struggling to keep his family together as he searches for the AI ​​version of his daughter (also deceased in the explosion) in a virtual Machiavellian version of Caprica (which strongly resembles the 1930s). Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to the tasteless writing, Caprica suffers from a problem similar to that of many original stories. We already know how this ends (ie the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
