The cliche of the shell bomber who returned home after the war is badly treated. The pity, a splendid actor who acts at the limit of his talents, can not buy "The return of the soldier" of his incapacity to bring the spectator to an emotional implication. As another reviewer noted, the best moments are when Glenda Jackson is on screen; but even Jackson's cinematic power can not pull the chestnuts out of this film from his cold, never-heated hearth. Ann-Margret, famous for her sex-kitten and too often accused of lack of ability to act, finds her real and rather deep abilities spoiled here - despite the fact that she speaks with a near-perfect Middlesex accent. The used score, evoking the saccharine emotionalism spotted by many dull television miniseries, irritates the emotional distance of the screenplay, the blockage and the overloaded formalism of management; With the exception of his corseted partition, script and direction, "The Return of the Soldier" has all the elements, but he can not get them to work together.
