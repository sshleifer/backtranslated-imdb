I will give two stars to this film because it swarms with beautiful photographs. Otherwise, it is teeming with clich√©s and stereotypes: the mountaineers are either dumb white garbage of the fanatically religious type, or ragged racists or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move noiselessly, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds over great distances. And so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I always wondered what was the interest of the film (apart from showing me pretty images of mountains, log cabins, wood, an assortment of animals, enthusiastic mountaineers and weird people in a church). <br /> <br /> The plot has touched on a host of issues, but has not thoroughly explored any of them. It was not a story of growing up during the depression, nor being an orphan, nor a struggle for identity. He tried to be all these things and more, which made him superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film is supposed to be about Little Tree's education, we are learning almost nothing. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (brave and stoical) and a demonstration of distillery; tried to cut wood (which he failed) and to pour whiskey (literally); learned to read (and perhaps write) with the help of grandmother and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently he had not learned much during his internship because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, grandfather and grandfather and the character of Graham Greene have made Little Tree become in the end a Spiritual Person whose main purpose as an adult - after, and I paraphrase here, "ride the Navajos" and "get caught in some wars" - was to "catch up" with the characters of grandfather and grandfather and Graham Greene in paradise (instead of, for example, dating girls , to get married, to have children or other foolish things). <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say that I found Grandfather's commercial offensive. Why should all things still be a whiskey? To counter the stereotype of "drunken Indian"?
