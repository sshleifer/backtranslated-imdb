This is the worst movie I've seen since "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you if you choose to go see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I was a big fan of you ... did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, what is f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, here is the story in a nutshell ... Nine is waking up, he's doing things, his actions and his decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh, wait ... here's a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoil alert! At the end of the movie ... it's raining. I think part of my soul is dead watching this movie.
