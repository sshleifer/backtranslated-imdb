Watch this movie? I thought, how much garbage. These girls must have stones for the brains to even agree to be part of it. Loss of time watching, lean sky, I only rented it. The acting was below standard and the story was unbearable. If you plan to watch this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit. I am a real movie buff and it is worse than "The Attack of Green Tomatoes". <br /> <br /> I only hope that this trash was not expensive. The money would have been better spent on homeless people around the world. I only hope that there will be no follow-up in the pipeline.
