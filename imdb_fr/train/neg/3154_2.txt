Look, there is nothing spectacular offensive in this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical romantic comedy with an ending that you can see coming even before you've seen the trailer. The main difference is that classic rom-coms approach their stories with humor and lack of pretension. This film has no pretensions but it really does not have the sense of movement, it seems to be able to get up and away at any time. The production of the film also has the impression of a first film made about fifteen years ago. I would recommend watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael as cute as Vaughn in Alias, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way he's made it look here.
