I found it very difficult to watch this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to have a sore throat 45 to 50 minutes before turning it off with disgust and watching Monster House instead (which is very fun, by the way). <br /> <br /> The story is adorned with huge holes. The plot of the plot is enormously over and sad, the acting is awful, especially Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he does well (look silly and sing like a castrato) . Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was forced to dance to rock music for no apparent reason halfway through the movie after meeting Timberlake. The characters of Freeman and Timberlake seem to be supposed to have some sort of father / son relationship or something, which is just not obvious at all except that; Although the character of Freeman seems to have nothing but contempt for Timberlake's ignorant and rather stupid character, he is still making every effort to help him discover a completely ridiculous dissimulation. <br /> <br /> It would take a little unbelievable suspension of incredulity to give credit to the script, which is simply absurd and excessive. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
