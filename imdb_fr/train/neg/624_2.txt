Behind the scenes, the director says he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as other remarkable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. In fact, dedicating this film to these great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh * t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. MOLDED PEOPLE WHO CAN ACT. Also, do not throw a 40-year-old person for the role of an 18-year-old loner. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions of people watching their boyfriend's heartbreak are amusing. Or as a party when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh .. my ... my God?" The scarecrow itself is quite a character. Drop the cars and call the losers. <br /> <br /> The film has a redeeming factor ... oh, wait, no. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely MUST see this movie, just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers just about everything and has a really great song.
