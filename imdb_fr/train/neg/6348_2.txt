Quite absurdity. The material is dull, dull, dull, and most actors would not even have doubled in Allen's previous films. And being forced to listen to the incredible Will Ferrell imitating Woody Allen makes me even more hate the second-rate Ferrell (though mysteriously popular). It seems that the morose Allen, 70, should have interrupted his work when the clock rings in a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to participate in the film, but it was simply impossible; my straps could not pull so slowly. So instead of falling asleep in the afternoon and sleeping in an upright position, I got up, left my wife and my wife at the theater and went to the car where I had a very good book to read again (the great volume of George Bailey "Thirty years ago," Germans. ") The day finally went well, not thanks to Woody.
