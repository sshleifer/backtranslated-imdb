3lbs is obviously just a complacent program for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / deep doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and unlike Gray's Anatomy, brain surgery cases are not even interesting. This program is supposed to take place in a leading center for neurological cases - yet there is nothing interesting or exciting! Even the so-called pathetic "quarrel" between him and a rival adds nothing to the series, any more than these hallucinations. As part of the pilot project, we had a brief overview of the father's social life as a father: take a nap! boring and useless. <br /> <br /> This show is a pair of pants, there is a plethora of medical dramas at the moment and it does not do anything to make it so special.
