This film is hilarious, not in a good way. The fighting is terribly bad, as they sometimes try to shock you by breaking bones, and even that only happens two or three times, which is certainly not enough to call a shock movie. A shootout means that a hero can enter an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi, take a rifle, start shooting and not get hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy wakes up, lost his memory, starts to fight, that's what he's doing well. Five years later, memories return, revenge blah blah. <br /> <br /> Not worth your money, not worth your time unless you're drunk and bored.
