David Mamet is a very interesting director and not very egalitarian. His first film, "House of Games", was the one I liked best. He was editing a series of films with characters whose life perspective changes as they find themselves in complicated situations, as well as the viewer's point of view. <br /> <As well as "Homicide" which, according to the title, tries to put the mind of the spectator in the tragedy of the usual crime. The main characters are two cops, a Jew and an Irishman, who take care of a region with a strong racial overtone. The assassination of a former Jewish shop owner who turns out to be a veteran of the Israeli War of Independence triggers Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> This is where the film's weaknesses are most evident. The revival process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish activists is opera and the way the detective finally goes to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself resembles that of Mamet, but disappoints from a human emotional point of view. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy perform well, but the flaws in the story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
