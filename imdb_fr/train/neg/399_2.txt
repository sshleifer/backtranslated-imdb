This image started with good intentions, the Bacon scientist tried to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute as usual in his role. Everything breaks up then, it's now your typical Hollywood thriller, filmed on a sound stage with special effects galore, less any kind of humor, spirit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time looking at this. Get the audio cassette with John DeLancie as Invisible Man instead, also featuring Leonard Nimoy. It was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
