I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some sort of talent but they were all in what is basically a Cinemax-style skin movie Go aboard a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sad as it should be, "Alien Intruder" tries to become unique, with a computer virus / an extraterrestrial demon / a harpy / the name of his name, Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrate this sort of station high-tech virtual reality aboard a spaceship where four men are allowed to live their fantasies while their system is monitored by their captain (Williams). <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here everything goes like a well padded episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams outclasses everything on the right and left, and it looks like he prefers to do something else, EVERYWHERE else. Ah, all that people do for money .... <br /> <br /> FX effects are pretty static, maybe even less than you would expect for a video movie cheap like this one. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, it contains ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a teasing and brainless movie, take a look at "Alien Intruder". Of course, you probably will not have to look any further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, not even for what power of stars this film can gather. <br /> <br /> Leave this one lost in space.
