One of the worst romantic comedies (no, the worst movies) I've ever seen. Boy (who works like a psychic on the phone!) Must pretend to be gay to move into an apartment with the woman of his dreams. The hilarity does not follow. Boredom, light gays and horrible dialogue do the same. If you read Brad Meltzer and love his crappy dialogue, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid that. If you see it, destroy the copy.
