I read the book Celestine Prophecy and I could not wait to see the movie. Be advised that the film is loosely based on the book. Many of the most interesting points of the book do not even appear in the film. It's a movie "B" at best. Many events, characters, how the character interacts and meet in the book are simply changed or do not happen. The events in the book are very fluid, jerky, and neat as if you were a child. The development of the character is very poor. The personalities of the characters differ from those of the book. The direction is similar to a horror movie "B". I understand that it would take six hours in a movie to present everything in the book, but the basics of reading on the screen missed a lot of points. The cast was very good.
