Times are tough for Angel Town, the gangs reign with an iron fist and for almost unknown reasons (mainly because of embarrassing writing), the gangs want a street kid, Martine, to join the gang, so they beat him every day. However, because of the presence of an Olympic boxer (Gruner, Olivier "the worst actor in the world"), named Jacques, hope is at the rendezvous. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept messaging movies of all time (and I've seen my share) it seems to be made up of the idea that all gang-infested neighborhoods need, are kick-start French boxers who can not act. Even worse, there are so many annoying moments that it's really hilarious. The best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon that basically summarizes how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: "Do you like fighting?" (Olivier catches his best Asian friend) I could kill him, right? When I want him dead, he dies! The reason I do not want him is because I I'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him, his son and his wife will kill me, that's why he does not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that he It is of course excluded from the equation to be wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend. Odd. <br /> <br /> However, do not let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's terrible, it's priceless. The loudest laughs occur at the end of the disastrous finale that sees Grunner face gang members face-to-face, which (the biggest logical flaw in the film) discourages the use of pistols. A disabled Vietnamese veterinarian also helps by firing his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner hits the rest. All this is set to the sound of horrible "Mexican" accents and a surreal energy that make it unforgettable for fans of such garbage such as this one. <br /> <br /> The other treat of this movie is, for whatever reason, Olivier Gruner never goes to college when that's the main reason he's here in France and not in France to get along with his girlfriend (In a clumsy early cemetery of the movie), Angel Town is definitely a failure at every level imaginable, but laughing at stupid martial arts movies with insane levels of action that do not make sense at any level, it's the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, be sure to note the tequila, as in the laughable song "We have no mercy on Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
