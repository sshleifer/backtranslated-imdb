I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box, I thought it sounded like a good story ..... however, the first problem was that there was really no story ... or in reality, there was one but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there was no installation for these characters ... yes, I understood that they were all going to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the film, you were realized that they had nothing in common and did not like each other. ... so why did they keep coming together? Fault number 3 ... the director, although long pauses and tight shots, matched the suspense (especially with the typical suspense music dubbed) ... he was unfortunately mistaken. It was painful to see a great actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring her back to life ... my only hope is that the money she earned here was spent producing her own movie.
