OK, I like bad horror. I particularly like the horror enough to make fun of. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. Coupe was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> I have a number of comments, both in the style "it sucks" and in the field of criticism. <br /> <br /> Intrigue (somehow) - There's a guy in this city (which may be Seattle, see comment below) running and cutting his head. He has been doing this for over a year (I will not go back to get exact numbers - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. One head a week. And the police call JUST NOW a "specialist" (who, once, presents himself as a psychic, but it never comes back). <br /> <br /> Schya is right! The federal government takes over after which, THREE related homicides? After almost a hundred similar killings, we would be under the terror of martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this "specialist" consults the voodoo chick that the police ignored all the time, and both of them come to the conclusion that this is the Baron Saturday, a voodoo spirit, who cuts the heads to gain enough power to become a body (and then presumably conquer the world - or maybe just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Adjustment - where does this happen? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you may not realize that at bar / rave (occupied by about ten film staff and family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialogue (like IF) between the two cops (yes, those who have their heads cut off about 15 minutes in the movie) they discuss the "new stadium" that can still to be a problem when that film was shot. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize on behalf of the film and my head is shameful. <br /> <br /> OK, that's where it gets really critical: being a horror movie writer (unpublished, do not look for my name in IMDb), I do some research. A lot of research. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Loa Von (spirit) guarding cemeteries and has been traditionally associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a trickster who looks like "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not cut his head. <br /> <br /> In addition, an important part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies are centered on the possession by various members of the congregation of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Without forgetting, if he already has a person, why create a NEW body? <br /> <br /> If Baron Samedi had a body, he would not cut his head, he would have good rum, cigars and par-TAY !!! <br /> <br /> In summary, the only thing they did (surprisingly) is that in the totally useless reading of tarot cards (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "spooky" "), they did not screw up the interpretations of the cards as most movies do. Once again, I did some research. (Someone remembers the old late-night ad for the tarot readings on the phone: "Lovers - you'll soon fall head over heels in love ..." and all that nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you succeed that far in my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I will be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie because of me, so please do not do it.
