You bring together 5 writers, ask everyone to write a different story with a different genre, then you try to make a movie. It's action, it's adventure, it's science fiction, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie absolutely stinks. 4.5 gives him a very bad rating. That said, it's movies like this that make me think I could write movies and can hardly write.
