While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them described military instructors as ex-Nazis. Obviously, the writers were anti-military types or wrote a film for this audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnamese veterinarian and, even at that time, military instructors who behaved this way. Some of them would probably still be incarcerated in a military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really liked the scene where the "hero" and his friend (the two soldiers) are sitting in the captain's office and smoking cigarettes and talking and talking with the captain as if he was their boyfriend. This kind of thing never happened during training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I asked myself: "What was this movie about?" as he seemed to wander in all directions for no other purpose than "I hate all authority". Thank God I got it at the library and I did not pay to rent it.
