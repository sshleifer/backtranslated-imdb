It must be the most cheesy, stupidest and most delayed movie of all time. It's a complete joke that it even surfaced in theaters. It's a bit like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this garbage dump must be lobotomized. Expect! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before the shoot. How to explain otherwise the pure and stupid stupidity that contains this bucket of shit. Do not waste a minute of your life watching this. Do not even waste your time sending a review.
