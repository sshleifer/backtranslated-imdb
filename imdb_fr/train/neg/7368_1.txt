I had the misfortune to lose 10 pounds by buying a new SS DVD movie: Attack Force. Now, I can usually suspend my belief by watching movies like this one. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark evening on the couch watching a noisy shoot in the late evening are perfect for a single alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking that I would see martial arts and film them. <br /> <br /> Segal is old and bloated, the plot was ridiculous, even by SS standards, and there is nothing wrong with his role (as in the beginning) is extremely disastrous. So terrible in fact that half of his voice was dubbed by a man who does not sound like him. Either SS can no longer act (questionable point) of the crew that was so awful in his work that he could not record the sound properly. The voice would oscillate between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man announcing the announcements of Honda! <br /> <br /> The scenario is not a problem, because most action movies work on the same principle as this one, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters who will die horribly like cannon fodder and stereotypical villains waiting to be blown away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film as if you avoid walking in front of a high-speed train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu. <br /> <br /> Immaculate waste. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This is a warning to public health.
