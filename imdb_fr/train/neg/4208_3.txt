There is a very good film that lies just beneath the surface of layers and layers of cheese that is "the Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I discovered it by watching this movie again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating him passionately as soon as he was released, but this time, I found that the special effects were pretty good. The plot is just "endless story" with a creativity endectomy, but it's a good little movie for anyone who just wants some really impressive eye fame. The animation is amazing, and I particularly liked the way the animators give their characters a more surreal look and feel than the norm. I give it a score of three as I would have given two (just for the parodic value) if I had already decided to watch this film expecting him to surprise me with his story.
