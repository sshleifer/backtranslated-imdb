I have almost always been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. I thought that the quality of the film would be automatically improved if only extremely boring songs were eliminated. However, things quickly changed after watching this awful Black (no songs) and this movie, page 3 (full of songs). While Black was weak to the extreme, he delivers a captivating story with strong acting and direction. The songs were almost accidental and blended almost perfectly into the film. There are certainly no women sprinkled with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources as they roamed the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the director's bold and unthinking approach. There was no hiding of anything and almost every scene was completely believable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to Hindi with at least a slight understanding of life in Mumbai. The first because English subtitling was below par and contained many errors that sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the statement. The latter because you will certainly appreciate the accuracy of the representation once you have experienced it yourself. <br /> <br /> I would certainly rank this work in the category of works worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the chatty pilots were a nice touch and served both as a source of authentic humor and as another point of view on the mishmash. However, the film is missing in some places, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that affect the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that some of the saddest scenes were not done very well. It was a fun touch to watch, rather than arouse a feeling of sadness and the whole scene tended to sound a bit silly. These are minor issues, however, as overall, the movie is truly a treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall, cynical, pessimistic and refreshing! Actors, not "heroes" - that's the key. A chance to see credible human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. Behind the scenes, the extent of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
