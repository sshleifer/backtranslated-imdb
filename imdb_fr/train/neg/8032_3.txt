This has had a big cast with stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Scott Randolph, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch of smaller but known names with shorter roles. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films shot with in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... Unfortunately, I can not say much about the story. He portrayed James boys in a totally positive light ... and Hollywood has done the same since. Why these criminals are always shown as "good guys" is beyond me. This film glorifies them and makes their enemies - the railwaymen - a perverse human being. The latter was so exaggerated that it was absurd. Well, it's the movie world for you: the bad is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: here's a news - James's boys were criminals! Really - look!
