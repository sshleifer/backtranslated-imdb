If you like to see what must have started as a two-hour movie with uncontainable flints of unrelated, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you'll just wonder how they could make such a movie from something as simple to translate on the big screen as a Gadget Inspector. not in the film, and in the film, some scenes simply do not make sense. Although the film lasts just under an hour and a half, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, namely, just before or during the credits!
