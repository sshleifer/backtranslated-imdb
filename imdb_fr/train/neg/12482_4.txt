Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and is performed by Rick Hill, a body builder and famous in this field, as I understand it, is not it? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to recover something from the evil Lord and has to go to the Lord's cave. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his journey. The settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, Conan the barbarian. This is a scam of Conan's huge success, and although it's a very stupid movie, it has many nice merits and it is recommended to fans of baskets and those who tolerate moviegoers! <br /> <br /> There are not many cinematic deserves in this film. Some scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker is focused on showing are naked women and Hill's huge muscles. Women are usually helpless and very stupid victims too. This film is very macho and will not appeal to many feminists! Combat scenes are nothing special and boring, and monsters are nothing special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and poorly done, but what did you expect from a small budget like this? This is trying to be as big as Conan but fails miserably enough. As I said, this may appeal to turkey moviegoers but to no one else. That's part of the category "so much so that's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad as it could be, and as a turkey movie, I appreciate that almost as much as the other turkeys, nice of course! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try it and have fun, but if you do not understand the "pleasantly bad movies", stay away. someone can not stand a lot of nudity, so stay away, here there is more nudity than violence, and thanks to these scenes, the film is rated R. Otherwise, it could to be a safe family PG movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
