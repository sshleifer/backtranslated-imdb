Making a film riding on the prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would even impose a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not this filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Describing the fall of a good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60 to 80 minutes are extremely boring with only a few pockets of lightsaber fights but there is a lack of advantage because you already know which main characters have survived the original version of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) plays a very ephemeral role here and the best idea is to make sure Jar Jar Binks is silent! <br /> <br /> No, the movie only resumes when the chancellor turns on the Jedi and has a large sequence (super long) to the lava falls
