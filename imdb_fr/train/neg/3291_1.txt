Let me first say that I am not a fan of the Dukes, but after this film, the series looked like Law and Order. The worst was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse Mr. C. Gainey as Roscoe, if they watched the show, Roscoe was not a hard-to-cook cop. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is full of usual mistakes, cars tearing and continues as if nothing had happened. The worst example of this is when the general meets with Billy Prickett and the general collides with a dirt hill that obviously slows to an immediate stop, but continues to win the race.
