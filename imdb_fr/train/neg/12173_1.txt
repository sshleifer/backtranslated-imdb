My friend and I rented this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie we've ever done! <br /> <br /> My friend and I also counted 475 face shots. (Which represents 95% of the film). <br /> <br /> In other words, do not see this film unless you like to waste money! And I do it! <br /> <br />
