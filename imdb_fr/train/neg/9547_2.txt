An under-the-average video game is transformed into a sort of conspiracy to find the next terrorist in the US court. Welcome to the madness of movies made directly and cheaply. It's full of nameless actors and actresses with little value conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game continues and our "hero" bets real money and does a good job on it. It's a bit like the game, except that the game is gone and it's bad. Instead, it's an online game with little real value and you'll have the authority if you do good. <br /> <br /> What is even stranger is that two strange computer programs are quarreling and everything is saved in the end. I will let the viewer see how everything will come to fruition. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not even worth a $ 1 rental. Borrow him, please. "RE-"
