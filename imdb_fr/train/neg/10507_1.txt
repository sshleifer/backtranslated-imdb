OK I and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of B movies since we do them ourselves. Anyway, the blanket contained blood and strange naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! It's just impossible that this movie fails! Right? false!! It sounds like such a waste! There was really no history, the dialogue was terrible (is there anyone? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really lacked personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what's new long artistic shots of scared people running around doing nothing ... with extremely close-ups of the eyes and the like? We sat around the whole movie waiting for something to happen ... but no ... "oh, here are the nymphs! Awesome! Oh ... they kiss ... again ... and now for the violence ... OK ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they run ... and the close-ups of the eyes ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini! he's dead ... okay ... maybe something cool or even interesting will happen ... no ... oh, cool, a broken head! oh shit ... "And finally, since I'm so full of me .. I'll tell you that! Give me a van, six actors, a weird house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I did movies with a budget zero in two days, it gives better effects, a better acting and a better scenario than this one ... what does this guy Johannes ?? Make cool movies, it's easy! It could have been so great ... I'm really pissed !!
