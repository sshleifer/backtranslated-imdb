Garbo Talks, my twenty-fifth film by Sidney Lumet, is running hastily because of the mediocre quality of my quest. <br /> <br /> The film describes a harassed young worker named Gilbert. (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, fiery and above all, a fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle suffers from a brain tumor, her son decides to embark on an obsessive quest: find Greta Garbo and bring her to her mother's house. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is in full adventure, Cheaw-the-scenery plays Auntie-Mame here, that kind of spirited girl that the movie loves, where she slaps people, defends her ideals and ends up in jail all the time. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is lame of yuk-yuk; each note striking fake. The rest of the characters are also one-dimensional, but extremely less interesting. Ron Silver is as flat as possible, and his love triangle attempt is as telegraphed as the rest of the film: he goes out with the rich Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but falls under the spell of his colleague Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called each scene three scenes before they happened. <br /> <br /> That's the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are set in a fascinating and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The film's rhythm is freezing, resplendent with a foreign matter that does not reinforce absolutely anything, and when the film begins to follow a linear scenario, it is both heavy and uninteresting. So to speak, there are many stars, including Harvey Fierstein as gay New Yorkers (imagine it) in another extremely inessential scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the film tries to make a mid-way transition- decent statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but at that moment, no characters exist as real people, and the movie bored me in submission, so it works like a case of too-little-much, much too late. This film is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, which makes it easily the most seen director, but apart from a couple of flagrant gaps (A stranger among us, whoever?), He did not not probed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks. <br /> <br /> {Note: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / No. 21 (out of 24) of 1984 / No. 23 out of 25 films in lumen}
