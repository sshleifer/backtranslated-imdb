This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see it tonight ... the first day because the anticipation and the hype were too difficult to manage. But in the first half hour, we knew it was a disaster. Not only does it not match the hype created but it also insults the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, the editing was messy several times. Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did a good job. Amitabh was fine .. the director wanted to show how perverted his character was, but he went a little too far, which made him powerful. Ajay who is particularly talented in such roles has also been a disappointment. Do not even start talking about the new guy Prashant ... we would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav who was thrown into a few bursts of laughter could not even make everyone smile because of his energetic humor and his shrill voice. Nisha Kothari proved she was one of the worst actresses we have today. Overall, RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors India has ever known, failed miserably. He took on such a challenge and took on the responsibility of redoing what is known as the best Hindi film of all time and ruined it.
