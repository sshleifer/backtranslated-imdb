I chose this film in the hope that it would look like the hilarious movie "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary made famous by the office, but it fails. Part of the reason is stiff acting, but mostly writing and directing. While it may be fun to use each of the RPGs, it's done here to make it extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene, you know what the "joke" will be. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is described in an exaggerated way. There is no subtlety in this film, if there were legends "LAUNCHING NOW" or a track of cheap faux-laugh like the 80s, it would make little difference. In some scenes, you can not help but think, "Yes, I understand why they thought it would be funny," but the way it's done removes all the buzz at the joke.
