Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a poor man without any moral quality. He only wanted to succeed in a society where everyone, politicians, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. Hero of Maupassant, Charles Forestier climbs higher and higher in the hierarchy of society thanks to his seducer seduction. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the stages of society. At the end of the novel, he married the daughter of the largest owner of newsprint, in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "All Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a deputy and then a minister. "Unnecessary" women are out of his sight, but he always stays in touch with pretty and useful women. The image "THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BELIEF" is a story of morality. That's all, but not a story in Maupassant's idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in his title?
