The most horrible story of a great series. He should not have been called Battlestar Galactica because his name alone is the same. Too many changes to just have them. You have transformed characters from men into women, from black to Asian to Christian, so as to "attract a female audience," while there were already strong female characters that could have been reinforced. No more Egyptian feeling. Finished the quest for the land. The lack of Cylons to go to the terminator rejects the film, especially when one is made a fembot. True, the original series contained a lot of cheese, but there were a lot of fans. They have tried to stick to that, but they have nothing to do with the fans and spit in their faces as they make "their own story". Changes are good when they improve something, not just to make them.
