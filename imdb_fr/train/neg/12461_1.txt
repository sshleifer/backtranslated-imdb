Unlike most of the other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, my family and I had the trouble to watch this movie on DVD at home, a waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a film based on a scenario whose writer was far too intelligent. Rather than trying to tell a complex story in a clever and clear way, it was assumed that one was constantly throwing out vague images that were difficult to relate to each other. 30-second vignettes presenting different stories from a dozen stories the audience has made the viewing great and clear. No, sir, that's not the case. Full clarity, precision, intrigue and storylines, as well as characterizations, which have a beginning, a middle and an end are the main assets for good viewing. <br /> <br /> This type of cinematographic presentation - similar to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant is pretentious and senseless to the extreme. <br /> <br /> God be praised, then, for the TV shows and DVDs of the Hollywood and British black films of the 1940s and 1950s whose authors, director and actors knew the value of the clear story, the diction and acting that meant something. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that this family will never see again.
