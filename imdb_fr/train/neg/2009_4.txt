This is not an entirely bad movie. The plot (the new house next door seems haunted) is not bad, the atmosphere is quite terrifying and the acting is acceptable. The big problem I had was that, knowing Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not understand how different she was with her new, seemingly new, big lips. I kept looking at them. They look so out of place on his face! They make it completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim, the architect who designs and pours all his heart into the house, does a great job. And Lara (as Col) is also pretty good (but those lips!) As the owner of the neighboring house. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is made of wood appropriately. The different characters living in the house were equally good. I especially loved Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first inhabitants of the house. The attempt to get involved in the general atmosphere of the district has failed, unfortunately, because the other neighbors are not particularly friendly. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director has not been able to make the house "haunted" particularly disturbing. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to create this sinister sensation, but that just does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints a portrait of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the plot that goes on with Kim, the architect. At first, he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (she sucked him), but later, he seems to have united with evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not bad A movie for horror fans if you can look away from those big lips!
