I watched this film under the pretext that Amber Benson was great and that Nick Stahl was generally pretty cool. I thought that any film featuring two actors that I appreciate and respect can not be so bad. And in that sense, I was right - given the instinctive dialogue that was given to them, the two work pretty well. Not enough to prevent the film from sucking, you understand, but enough so that I can go through the 75 minutes of the film (and this is the main sign of an awful movie: when, at 40 minutes, you are already praying for that be finished). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know where to start with the problems of "Taboo". Dialogue, as mentioned, is appalling. in wood and completely unnatural. January Jones's acting is incredibly bad, and since this is the character we spend most of our time following around the house, it's an unforgivable fault. The plot manages to be so complicated that it makes no sense, but it's totally clichÃ©d to the point of being totally predictable (literally, it's not one of the major 'twists' of this film would surprise a child.Besides some interesting shots, the director is too much effort but not enough success, clumsy follow-up plans and a work camera restless that distract from this little piece of history. /> <br /> Three of the stars of this film are rewarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last is thrown on the grounds that one of the jokes made me sneer a little.I would not recommend this movie to anyone, never, under any circumstances, to avoid at all costs.
