I saw the comment of the capsule saying "super actor". In my opinion, these are two great actors who give horrible performances and who have no chemistry, for a great director in his worst effort of all time. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance is uncomfortable on the map because she clearly has no control over this character, mainly because the character is so poorly written. The molasses would look too much like an adjective for the unsustainable rhythm of this film. Although the film aims to be an edifying story of healing illiteracy, viewing is a real "stoned". I give it 1 in 10, really one of the 20 worst movies I've ever seen for its budget.
