Bad actors, bad filming, jerky dialogue, superficial characters, but again, it was a bad premise. Basically, a weak criminal gives a blank check to an 11-year-old bully because he has very little money. Of course, the 11-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, cash a $ 1,000,000 check and even thwart three idiots reminiscent of the three guys. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is a boring and obnoxious boy who decides that when he writes a blank check of a stranger, he will make the most of the situation. In other words, he walks in a bank, <br /> <br /> hands a cashier a check he makes in his printer and comes out miraculously with a million dollars in cash. Preston is also apparently able to reach incredible speeds on his bike, as a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his speed at 10 speeds could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there must be a sexy heroine. In this case, our hot heroine is a child molestation FBI agent who goes out with Preston, eleven, and promises him another date when he turns 17. <br /> <br /> However, the worst aspect of this film was not its casting. nor his sloppy dialogue, such as "The only other way I can think of skinning a cat is to stick a pipe up and then pick up the fur". It was rather the fact that no one in the entire movie seemed to realize that the FBI did not care at all about random people. What I have not been able to explain is that Preston uses the alias "Macintosh" to pretend to be an entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old mind to shout first when lobsters fall on his face, then offer him hamburgers, to end up in a ridiculous smashes into a cemented area where the water jetty is from the ground. Our heroine can not understand during this whole adventure that the criminal pursued by the FBI slips behind the two, as they head for the Preston limo, with a driver to a dimension that never fails to provide a tariff cheap third class. laughs that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1/10 is incredibly graceful for this film. I do not see how he only has a 4.4 / 10.
