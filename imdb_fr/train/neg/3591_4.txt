First of all, let me say that I am a strong supporter of Fanpro products. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after its cancellation. Star Trek Travel and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a weakness for fanpro stuff, it means that I will neglect things that I ordinarily ordain bad. <br /> <br /> Let's go to ST: HF. Well, first of all, the good things. Enthusiasm is an essential element of the credibility of any show and, overall, the crew of the various ships seems to be having fun with its roles. Then, the effects are not harmful for a home effort, nothing makes you really wince. The stories are not too bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but enough solid material and at least there are story-bows going on. <br /> <br /> But he has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all, even if they have obviously To scam Star Trek sequences, sets, music and effects, I see no reason why they proceeded to scam of virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever created. Everything from Aliens to Starship Troopers, raises his orchestra head at one time or another. Likewise, much of the footage comes from other films, but CGI has conscientiously created them to give them a different look. The Gray warships, for example, although disguised, are of course Star Wars Star Destroyers. And the station is also quite obviously the battle station of the Ticonderoga fleet of Starship Troopers. In the same way, the sound effects of various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, in the same way as moving pictures. In a scene in the first or second season, I think you even see two TIE fighters parade through a battle, which is hardly an obstacle to your suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> The action varies from reasonable to reasonable. terribly painful to watch. Everyone improves with the seasons, but expect to grin in front of the screen, especially at the beginning of the season. They also made interesting acting choices. Let's just assume that the product replicators of this show seem to be always ready to "go to bed" and stay there. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are usually quite effective. But they should really ruthlessly punish to death the person who decided to use Ferengi's and Cardassian's cheap masks for purposes other than background use or "disfavor" shots. They are just beyond unrealistic. Whenever I saw one (apart from trying not to laugh too much), I was still expecting the unfortunate wearer to carry a gun and tell him it was a " stick!" In a scene, a "cardassian" speaks by wearing one of these. Not only the lips do not move, but the mask does not even have an opening instead of the mouth. Someone has to be slapped for that. Would not they have been able to use a craft knife for God's sake! There are also good makeup but funny fun, such as that of Herman Munster. <br /> <br /> The writing, although coherent, is not new. Instead, the script works as a continuation of DS9, the ships leaving DS12 for various missions. The new enemy, "The Gray", is not very threatening and the intrigue that involves them is actually a reworking of Borg's sons. that is, Starfleet meets the Gray, the Gray are extremely powerful, Starfleet escapes little by little, and through technology they start to find ways to fight the enemy, and so on. This is already done with the Borg. <br /> <br /> Another dialogue is the bone of contention. Star Trek writers have long known "insert a technobabble here" in a script. This usually means a presentation of the last enemy plan using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolytic charges", etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you they are on the case and that a resolution is at hand. <Br /> <br /> Words are just gibberish. This is not a problem for me, but ST: HF is fed up, that's where they include real comments in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice such as "We must regroup" sound good. , but not when pronounced by a trio of characters already present in a group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to answer, "We have three battleships." He really needed to count them? Let's go there! I was expecting the questioner to ask, "Are you sure?" or "Can you double check". But here is my favorite comment: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Communications Manager: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> That said, the show is improving as things go. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows improvement, but 4 and 5 are those where it starts to improve noticeably. Season 6 seems for the moment quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the choice of their media for emissions is problematic. Quicktime is bad, frankly, and the sooner they will change to the divx / avi format, the better. Some of us like to watch our downloaded shows and watch them on a good-sized screen and not look at a small QT window on a computer screen. Not only does Quicktime make this task difficult, but the 320x180 resolution in which the emissions are found is not very scalable. In fact, it makes the programs rather unassailable, as if they were a tenth generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was include a high resolution downloadable option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the series is promising and I'm even starting to like certain characters. But that's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure that says as much about character development. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free ... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes, 19 people have given 9 or 10 votes to this show. Hmmmm ... were we watching the same show? Or are you 19 years old every three years?
