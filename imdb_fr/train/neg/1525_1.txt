I watched this one weekend afternoon because there was simply nothing else, it would have been more fun to chew my feet and probably less painful. I invite everyone to watch this, just to see how badly a movie can be, it was deliberate. I feared every vain attempt at humor conducted in such a childish way, not apprehended and badly executed that it was incredible. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, do you think I'm exaggerating? Well, give him some airtime and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If it was not a farce, the director and all other officials should be removed and immediately shot after having to see the film again.
