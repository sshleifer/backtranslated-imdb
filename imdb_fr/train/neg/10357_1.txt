I really did not like this movie because it did not really convey the messages and ideas L'Engle brought out in his novel. We had read the novel in our English class and I really liked it, I'm afraid I could not say the same about the movie. There were serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and that simply did not honor the imaginative genius of Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I gave him such a bad rating. Do not see this film if you are a big fan of L'Engle's lyrics, because you will be very disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment (or education, as I was), then it's a decent movie!
