If I accidentally fell on this script in textual form, I would read it and I laugh maybe. However, I do not want to laugh at the points in the film where the director seems to want to make me laugh. Although I'm not quite sure where they are. I do not care if it's Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogue, or at least he can not deliberately write dialogue, then draw performances from actors able to make even the most ticklish clowns laugh. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I am an art historian, I am looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, that said, but honestly, do you know any art historians who would say that? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really, an art gallery, who would have thought of it?" <br /> <br /> The entire script is littered with the kind of spooky intellectual that I would not have thought of a writer of such a respected character. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work and, judging by this one, I do not want to start learning. The characters are disgusting without exception, an attempt to illustrate the fact that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really very poor character writing? You are the judge.
