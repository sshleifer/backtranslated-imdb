This inferiority superior to the silent film "Blind Dead" is another waste. So many people have made these films that I can not believe what they say. Since I was a kid, I've heard how scary and fun these movies are. I saw them all and was deeply disappointed. Have everyone been taking drugs since the 1970s or did they not know how boring this was?
