A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that if I gave Flushed Away a chance, I'd like it. Partly based on this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least from Aardman), but does not have the strength to bring everything together. Her best asset is Rita (played by Kate Winselt), captain of a boat / captain of the network, who, to our knowledge, should have been the protagonist of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his time on the screen crying. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bother me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to start with. When Roddy is hit, the movie makes sure he's five times in a row. "My name is Shocky," said one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags involving pain is at its lowest level. <br /> <br /> I do not waste time dealing with Katzenberg's kleptomanic tendencies towards Pixar (A similar film is a coincidence, five is a scam.), but I will say that I am disappointed by Aardman. They can do (and have done) so much better. Try harder next time, guys.
