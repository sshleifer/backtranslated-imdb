I can not believe how bad this film is without education. It's like watching a police academy, except it's with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot who's supposed to be a sidekick. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but it is total stupidity. Not only is there no plot for this movie. It's like looking at someone who claims to be a doctor, throwing out non-medical words as if he were the chief of staff of a large medical facility. In addition, people wear clothes that are not suitable for a space program. I feel like watching a movie "b" of girls in the valley, in space.
