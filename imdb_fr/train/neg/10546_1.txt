<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity in my film program and I thought it was awful. As I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, banal, petty and phenomenally important. <br /> <I consider myself a movie fan and all he has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, I will look at A & E .... and they would probably be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, simply. <br /> <br />
