In a nutshell, this movie was boring. He lacked life and spark. A big problem is with both tracks. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. He was boring and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The pictures were interesting, but they did not improve the scenes. On the contrary, the visual elements tended to detach the audience from what was happening on the screen. No sequence of action seemed real and the film did not create any real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting and a better director. I thought all along the movie, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford was Sky's captain, Karen Allen was Polly and Steven Spielberg, the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore rave reviews for this film. I think critics praise the film because they * want * to love it and want it to succeed even if it fails on many different levels.
