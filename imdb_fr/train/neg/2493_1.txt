A really terrible movie. At first, I did not know it was a Kiwi effort - but soon I realized that all the characters were talking with kiwi accents barely disguised as fake Americans. Why did he need to be settled in America anyway? - It could have happened in New Zealand and the actors could then have used their normal voice. Can someone in the production team hear the terrible attempts to speak with American accents? A bad bad movie. I'm surprised it's been going on for so long - how did it manage to get out of the box? It just looked like a very bad attempt at a Segal / Willis action type action movie. A total waste of money! If there was money in taxpayers in this trash, I would lead a revolution so that all the money is reinjected into the treasury. I'm still struggling (I understand, word game, word game!) In front of the garbage I just saw. Why did I keep watching? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and I can not do anything myself!
