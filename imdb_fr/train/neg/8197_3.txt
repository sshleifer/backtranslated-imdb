I just saw this movie tonight and I must say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but it ends up being more annoying than funny and the film is more than a remake of the classic "shit" of the 80s, "Santa Claus the movie", but without the camp or the bad Sheena song Easton at the end. The story tells of your black sheep in the family who returns to face his family during the holidays, but with the North Pole for decoration. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the botched family that returns home after a series of setbacks including his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo role) dropping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his brother Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and his wacky wildfires follow with a little rivalry between brothers and sisters and a little anarchy that threatens all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'd be right because it's predictable for the hill. As for the acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same adorable loser he always plays, but this time, he ends up being more annoying than friendly, Miranda Richardson plays the role of Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than 'a note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but she is not Poor Kevin Spacey ends up playing the same person as in the movie' Glengarry Glen Ross', but a little more anal. The only two actors who leave this film with their dignity intact are Paul Giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and makes happy his role of Santa, but he seems a little embarrassed to be in the film and you do not can not blame him and Rachel. Weisz, who managed to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors with theirs, which is a shame because Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much better than what the script offered them. <br /> <br /> In a word, a major disappointment.
