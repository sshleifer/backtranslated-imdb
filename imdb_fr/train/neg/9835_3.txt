Before explaining the comment "Alias", let me say that "The Desert Trail" is bad, even by the standards of the Westerners who set The Three Stooges. In fact, she represents Carmen Laroux in the role of the half-girl Juanita. When you hear her Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic short film "Stooge" "Saved by the Beautiful". <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail", John Wayne plays Moe Howard and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like their counterparts Stooge, Moe hits Curly for 53 minutes. Wayne's character, a skirt that continues to bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a rodeo cowboy on the road, Wayne holds up the rodeo box office under the threat of a gun and takes the money he would have earned if the proceeds of the event had been good . The other riders have to settle for $ 25 (actually even less after Wayne steals the box office). No explanation is given for Wayne who scam the runners and is still considered the hero who gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix-who would then play sheriff Micah on television "The Rifleman") see Wayne Rob at the box office, then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly get blamed. <br /> <br /> Moe and Curly move to another city to escape the law and change their name to Smith and Jones. Who do they meet first if not their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the love interest of the second half (Senorita Rita is left behind her in the old town and no longer makes any appearance in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is kindly portrayed by a radiant beauty, Mary Kornman (she grew up but, in her youth, she was one of the original cast members of the short film "Our Gang" from Hal Roach). Kornman is the main reason to watch the lousy-lame western and his scenes with Moe and Curly are far better than any other production, as if they had used a totally different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the action sequences are extremely weak and the technical shooting technique is incredibly bad. The two main hunting scenes end with footage of large shots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times, the publisher mounts one of the characters rolling on the floor, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different and the character has different clothes than the stuntman. There is liberal use of archive footage in other places, even if they are not convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch for is a scene halfway through the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and walk away (on the right screen) from a cabin while the band is galloped to the cabin by the left. The cameraman follows the two crews with a slow panning right, then pan to the left to reveal the approaching group. Apart from home movies, I've never seen anything like it, not because it looks stupid (which is the case), but because a competent director would never put on a scene of this way. They filmed the two runners as they left, then repositioned the camera and filmed the group as a separate action. Or, if they felt creative, they would stage the sequence so that the camera shows the runners in the foreground and the group approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
