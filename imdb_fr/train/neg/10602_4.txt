This film is mostly shit and the only reason it's worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme is the star of this movie. There are good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. <Br/> <br /> In this movie, the acting is so bad and the worst I've ever seen and the two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not play at all. And this film must be by far one of Claud Vam Dammes is the worst film he has made and if you want to watch it in one of his big movies, you should watch Blood Sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is shit / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
