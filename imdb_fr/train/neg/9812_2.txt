Not only was the plot of this film artificial with the ease with which the two psychos are able to remove a pregnant woman without sweating, but it was a terrible scam of 'Misery'. However, the main reason I gave this movie a low score is that it absolutely disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily shocked by what the filmmakers say and have always loved the horrors but this film went too far in terms of violence and torture just to gain points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people only watch the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seek', will find themselves reaching the remote control.
