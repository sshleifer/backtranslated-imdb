Superhero movies are almost always void, and this is no exception. His only quality that redeems is the fact that the film could have been even worse. I would put Batman & Robin and Steel on top of this movie, so yes, it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, take a look at "Blankman", it's not a "serious superhero movie" but at least it's entertaining.
