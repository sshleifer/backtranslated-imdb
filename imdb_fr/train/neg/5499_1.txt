I saw this bomb when she arrived in the room. I laughed all the time. Why? Because his stupidity seemed to drive me crazy. I think back and realize that there was not a funny thing in the movie. At least nothing intentional. It's terribly funny that Lizzie can chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic carnivorous demon ... yet her little dress is perfectly intact, even though it's now hundreds of times bigger than it is. Or the kind of film in which a man can be shocked with a defibrator and fall only unconscious, and come back to consciousness without ANY medical follow-up. And do not let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "bad guy" whom they decided they had to create a "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For the person who complains about Disney targeting only children - The hot parts of this movie seem to refute this claim. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having perverse video tapes? That's what you do if you're Disney and you're running out of ideas to make sure the movie appeals to 8 to 8 people without writing a smarter story! I am absolutely convinced that Disney is paying for the scoreboard, so that movies can be murdered while getting a favorable ranking for families. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
