It will be brief. Let me first say that I am agnostic and that I do not really have the madness of xtians, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone similar to that of a teenager angry at his Xtian mother for not letting him play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Mention how Charles Manson thought to be the Christ to illustrate the fact that xtianity can cause evil? I do not know if it was just cheap and childish - it gave the impression that the opposition was ignorant. In addition, the narrator seemed simply snobbish and pretentious. Delivery was complete and excessive. I can not take this documentary seriously. Can call on an edgy teenager upset with his Xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
