The Three Stooges in a western comic-musical feature? Maybe "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was supposed to combine Stooges' short film with the Western musical in a morning; in this case, it was a nice way to have a break on a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero. and Mary Beth Hughes (in the role of blonde June) and Gladys Blake (in that of brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots form a harmonious group. their songs are pretty melodious; However, we are in the 1940s and not in the 1950s. The film is not "rock". There are some laughs; but the humor of the Stooges is more moderate than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (04/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
