It is the nature of companies to try to capitalize on the success of others. Here we have a film with elements from the previous "Dracula" (1931) and "Frankenstein" (1931) - in a Germanic city, village chiefs believe that vampires (in the form of bats) were the cause the recent death of bloodless victims. Even though it's shot in Universal (and in the Bronson Caves!), It's a feature of Poverty Row; it is not fair to compare it with older, more expensive, higher quality films. <br /> <br /> From the familiar and exciting and scary music of the main titles (which was to be Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talky but good opening sequence, we anticipate the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good mystery movie of the 30s. Unfortunately, that does not happen. It's disappointment. <br /> <br /> We have only a few formula elements, but with a slow pace, a limited budget, not enough of Dwight Frye, the exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Aunt Gussie), and The reason why Lionel Atwill (Dr. von Niemann) needs human blood or how he exercises mental control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) has never been very clear. <br /> <br /> Do not look at the technicolor 'Dr. X '(1932) - which is also interpreted by Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter - before looking at it the way I did it; it is an oscar by comparison. So watch this one first. Structurally, 'The vampire bat' is still not very good. There is too much talk or unnecessary relief for comedy, without focusing on vampiric malice. <br /> <br /> Besides' Dr. X 'and' Mystery of the Wax Museum '(1932 and with Fay Wray), the most famous appearances of Lionel Atwill are those of the gendarme armed in' Son of Frankenstein '(1939) and Moriarity in' Sherlock Holmes and the secret Weapon (1943). Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931). As "young lovers", Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a beautiful kisses scene, but that's about it. It can be seen in "The Old Dark House" (1932) and Fay is dragged by Joel McCrea in "The Most Dangerous Game" (1930). Then, there is his classic "screamer" of 1933. Too bad more time, money and writing are not available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, this extremely disappointing film receives only a 4.
