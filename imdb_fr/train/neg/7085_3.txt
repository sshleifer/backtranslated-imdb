I really tried to like this movie. This concerns a major problem in any society: sexual addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having sex constantly with all kinds of women (crazy, naughty, neurotic) endangers his marriage, his work and even his life. <br /> <br /> the production values ​​are terrible; mainly the acting game. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very bad taste and you might think you are watching a homemade movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot is simply nonsense. How could such a beautiful and intelligent woman endure all the bad things of the husband? How could she believe it? The situation with three is invaluable and will make you laugh for a moment. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scene with the black cinema attendant is useless and will let you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you find in abundance. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; it's not soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. It's a pretentious effort on the part of a so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Ms. Kinski's exposed legs are worth watching. I caught him on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
