I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because she was a star. I do not think her films are good and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she was certainly great in comedy. All the comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this film may be more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this film and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. It always impresses me a lot to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of a sick woman. In this film, she is really beautiful.
