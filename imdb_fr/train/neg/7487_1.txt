Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course, they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons' script is not used in this film, so it falls flat. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke is given, so the joke dies, that is to say the couple having sex in the park. They announce that this is a lighting ceremony for New York, and we all know that the lights will come on and we can see Goldie & Steve do a little slap stick. The whole film ends up being like that ... a joke is prepared and given. Why are Goldie's hair never messed up in the movie? You will also notice every detail of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
