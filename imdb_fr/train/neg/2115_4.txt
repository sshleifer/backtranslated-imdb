Only the glandular secretions of young virgins (and please, do not ask for more details) can keep the body and spirit in rapid deterioration of the crazy wife of the old husband of a crazy amateur horticulturist. Since, like most people, with the exception of people participating in medical trials, virgins rarely voluntarily give up their secretions, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) organizes their removal and preservation. He will do the extraction himself. <br /> <br /> What a perfect cheese ball for a low budget horror movie. If the Corpse Vanishes does not turn out to be the Havarti of horror, it leaves an interesting aftertaste as an ordinary limburger. <br /> <br /> Of course, the acting is almost awful, except for the actors who have the chance to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the role of the Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazy brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the mad mother of both (Minerva Urecal); the crazy wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a stuffed coffin and, of course, the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An enterprising young journalist, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), finds the doctor because of a strange orchid with a particularly sweet flavor, worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to spend the night, a raging storm comes immediately. This clue tells us that unleashed violence will break out inside. As it is well known in Hollywood at this time, all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have unpleasant surprises. They include dark passages, a crisp laboratory where an almost dead virgin is stored, a mausoleum in the basement and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what story she will have to tell her publisher. <br /> <br /> If you taste this fluffy slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? do not be superior), do not judge Bela Lugosi from the company he keeps here. It had a huge impact on Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast, he is a sad and ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts skinning the man alive, ah, well, it's a beautiful scene.
