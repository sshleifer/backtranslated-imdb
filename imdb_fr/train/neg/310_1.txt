I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the Blockbuster wall. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at the time, I rented it. Honestly, I could only watch about 30 minutes. of that. It was terrible. Do everything in your power to keep it safe from the public. I sincerely hope that this film will soon go to OOP, and I hope it stays that way!
