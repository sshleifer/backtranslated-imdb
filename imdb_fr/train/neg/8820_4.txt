By entering a film like this, I did not expect anything fun, except for a slew of murders ... what I got was even less. <br /> <br /> On Christmas Eve 1947, a child sees his parents doing it while Dad is in Santa Claus costume. Horrified, he climbs the stairs and cuts himself off. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your usual daily joe ... except for the fact that he is obsessed with Santa Claus. After his boss makes fun of him, he goes crazy, dresses like a Santa and starts killing customers who do not believe in Santa and his boss. An unruly neighborhood catches up with him, and as they are about to set him on fire, he drives his van off a cliff ... into the moon. It was not the best end I have ever seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring movie that did not really have any redemptive quality, except when Harry left for churchgoers. There was almost no gore and even the scenes of "sex" were toned down. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 of 10
