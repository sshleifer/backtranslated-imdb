Unfortunately, it's not "the best British gore movie since hellraiser", although the DVD claims it, which prompted me to buy. However, it is a tribute to most of the great horrors of old movies, especially those of the Amicus team. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is shot in mini-film, which, although we all know a lot more of a TV sensation than a movie, can be done so much better. Each scene, each montage and each shot gives the impression that it has been lit in the same way (standard key, filling, rear configuration), which only improves the economic aspect of the finished piece. The gore content is, frankly, laughable. From the first shots where we see the head of a man obviously in torn foam rubber, through stinging hammers, creature effects and a terrible CG, there was nothing that impressed me. <br /> <br /> The acting game is abominable, from the almost comatose detective to the dwarf Brummie to Dani Filth, the least convincing horror film I've ever seen. Each of the sub-categories is more formulated than the last and the sets are getting worse day by day as the film passes. Look for the 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad sign of CG on the outside and the weirdest cell (and not in the good sense) I've seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to reach the end of the film without my attention getting lost (no, fugue) at any available opportunity. In fact, I found myself dusty at one point while the movie was spinning. <br /> <br /> This marks however one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which, I suppose, is one (uh, two) things right there. Once it's done, everything is downhill. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I'd like to believe them, but given that evidence, I'm unlikely. at. If you want a decent tribute to Amicus, avoid it and opt for the special League of Gentlemen Christmas. <br /> <br /> Currently fighting with Blair Witch 2: The Shadow Book for the title of the worst film I have ever had. already seen.
