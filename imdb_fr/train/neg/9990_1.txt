After watching this film on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this film was made by a group of amateurs who have never seen a movie of their life. The film is an endless sequence of odd occurrences or "delights" as the friend tells me over my shoulder. The plot is not worth commenting on, but basically, a plane carrying football players crashes into territory Yeti. Before the movie is over, we receive heartbreaking yetis, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a man's legs and hitting him with a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti who survived several bullets and who was burned without apparent damage, a Yeti who hang from the top of a cliff while standing at the shoe of a man, then jump then, and a whole collection of other strange events. Basically, if you do not stay awake on a Saturday to watch the original SciFi movies, avoid this movie as a scourge. Or, as my friend who reads above my shoulder says, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." What the friend on my right said: "Only techno combat music could have improved it."
