I have the "courage" to inform you that please, stay away from "Dahmer", the biographical film based on the real story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer 'gets lost more in relation to the mentality of his concentrated subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered more than 15 young men and ate parts of their bodies, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick are the filmmakers of this dreadful spectacle that should have been examined before deciding to give the green light to this dreadful project "dahm". This film is not easy to digest, even if Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some "appetizers" spirited or even some "real" guys. Skins of potatoes. * Failure
