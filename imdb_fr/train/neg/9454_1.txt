When my own child begs me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to scratch my eyes. I wanted to reach the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing his last shred of dignity. This is one of the few movies I have ever watched and immediately wanted to "unpack" if only possible. The other films being "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both better than this crap in the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget that I have never witnessed this blasphemy on the good name of Seuss. <br /> <br /> At Mike Myers, I say stick to Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. The fact that it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
