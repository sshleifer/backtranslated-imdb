It was a movie that I could not wait to see! So I finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. For starters, the film has talked so little about New York that a bunch of disturbing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It does not really stay focused on the magic of New York. notice. the film happens inside this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French remake! Anyway, here you will notice elements reminiscent of French movies, such as long and messy scenes, little or no chatter and of course, everyone smokes the French way! The story follows many lives (too many for my taste) and they seem somehow related to each other. I feel that there has been no dedication to the characters as much as in the stories. The film was too short to cover all the destinies of everyone's happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have your 120 minutes! if you like active scene dialogues, this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the casting!
