Some of the filmmakers in this series have made great movies, but they certainly do not show much talent with this series. In particular writing. OK, the first season was a little better, but these new episodes they create just create a stink. I am a big fan of horror and, in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes are hogwash. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typical Hollywood shit, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived and in some cases, completely ridiculous. Just like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this show offers is great nudity! Otherwise, this series is blowing hard. I sometimes feel like they have hired a group of grade eight students to write the episodes. Maybe they did.
