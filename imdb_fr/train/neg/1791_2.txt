What about the video trouble initially and sporadically throughout the film? It's like putting muddy water on the lens of the camera. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity could be confusing for some people, but I think it's the fact, with most bad actors, to make a good cult movie. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Alas, your race is dumb." Okay, no one should ever say "alas" in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The role played by Van Helsing's character and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Little Master played by Ron Little. Naughty martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will appreciate it.
