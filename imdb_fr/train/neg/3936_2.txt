Sensational. I thought it might be tasteless but it was even worse than I thought! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car crash" movie: the ones that are so serious that you can not look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly become. That's really the only reason I could leave the TV on a morbid fascination. It was not so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one might expect from the cast, but the premise and intrigue that should never have happened. The script, too, is moaning. As far as cinematography is concerned, did anyone else notice that he was using a device for drawing "curtains", as in an old television show of the 1950s ... but without irony? At first, I thought it was a joke, but the film takes itself too seriously for using it ironicly. Do not even ask me what the score is ... the only highlight is Morcheeba's final song. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad to have seen it on TV !!!!! Just idiot! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton has struggled to find a lot of work recently? I guess if you do not expect much and want to watch a senseless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening cutting your nails, which is why it deserves a 2.
