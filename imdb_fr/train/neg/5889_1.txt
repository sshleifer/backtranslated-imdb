First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are continually improving. Among the tedious emotional films of the '70s and' 80s, movies from this place began to contain a little humor. Imagine .. The actual comedies have been made! The movies were really starting to get fun and fun, as opposed to the long, dark, depressing and boring movies. <br /> <br /> During the 90s and 00s, some really great movies were made by a "new generation" of filmmakers. Movie after movie were praised by critics and played a lot of money. It has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then United came ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we are used to Norwegian cinema to be funny. Especially with a cast like this one with some really funny comedians. But .. They do not say or do anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me humor! Is the clumsy clerk played by Harald Eia? Is the football coach totally ridiculous and unrealistic? Is it Arne Scheie's comments? The movie is not funny! <br /> <br /> But that's not my main talk about United. That is predictability. (And this is where I'm worried that Norwegian comedies will not move since I've seen that in so many other movies too.) All the time, you know it's going to end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the film and everyone gets exactly what they deserve at the end. There is absolutely no room for surprises! <br /> <br /> In the end, I can say that I sat down with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. This is the only movie that made me understand that we probably needed some new blood in the making of a Norwegian movie ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
