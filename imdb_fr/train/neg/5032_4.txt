This film was in a 50 science fiction pack that one of my friends had for Christmas. It looks a lot like Gozilla's first film and, like this movie, features scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason. One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there is a Cold War tension between America and Russia. As at Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and ravages around the world, paying special attention to Tokyo, as no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo nibbles it. Overall, it's a good movie. Some scenes involving Gamera, especially those of Toly, are quite spectacular and have quite decent special effects at the time. If you like Japanese movies about giant monsters, you will really have a crush on this one. I give him a 4 out of 10. If it had been the unedited Japanese version I watched, he probably would have got a 5.
