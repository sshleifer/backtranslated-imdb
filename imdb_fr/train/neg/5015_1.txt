As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to watch a lot of movies, but not all very good movies. Some movies are so bad that you will not be surprised if they are directly released on video. With taboo, I am surprised that it is broadcast on video. It is a really poor budget and of poor quality. <br /> <br /> A group of young people plays a taboo game. They write their most disgusting wishes and deeds and, later, people are murdered for their taboos. The question is, do we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has interesting potential, but I will not let it go here. But what could have been interesting remains stupid, badly played and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors have already played in bigger titles, so why did they register for that? If you see it anywhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.
