... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least watchable for two thirds of the time, but the third boring and egocentric section of this film gave us a taste of what was going to happen in this extraordinarily complacent mess. Moretti says that he feels the need to make this film, but does not want it, while the viewer thinks it should remain, but does not really want it either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but it's not that movie. At some point, Moretti and his friends stand in front of the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the talks they are about to conduct with party leaders, but it is characteristic of this film that we will never be able to see them. . The political events that preceded the birth of his son are interposed with the political delusions of Moretti, then are filmed with his baby and later with his baby, Pietro (the film takes us for several years and more than one election period) . We expect to see a definitive sequence or persuasive argument, but they never come. I doubt that I can have the patience to see a Nanni Moretti film again. He managed to pass an hour and twenty minutes as an eternity.
