Serum speaks of a mad doctor who finds a serum supposed to cure all diseases thanks to the power of the mind. Instead, he creates a kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. The crazy doctor creates zombies with corpses and has some problems. There is a very long lead in all the action with many scenes familiarizing you with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew had a car accident and the mad doctor tried to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. It is a class C movie with OK, but some problems of realization and some errors of continuity. There is not much zombie action in this one and the effects, though adequate, are not special. You can fast forward in slow parts and enjoy action scenes. Watch for nudity and vulgar language.
