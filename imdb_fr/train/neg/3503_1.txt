And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I like humor quirky and irreverent. BUT this woman is so cursed B-O-R-I-N-G, boring and worth yawning. It also totally lacks anything humorous. The ruthless way she tries to deliver her lines is simply dead upon her arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of his show and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> My little girl (19) saw her Comedy Central promos and said she was a "silly girl". I thought it was a compliment. The one where she says "Look at my show or I'm going to kill my dog" is really believable. I know she wants to be an actress. It appears just like a distorted nut. I just do not want to see her around my dog.
