A crazy and cowardly movie. The director Boorman shows Cahill robbing rich houses, but he shows that the occupant is unfaithful with the nurse, so everything is fine. The forensic pathologist who is investigating Cahill jumped in his car, but he is a rat-faced smoker and does not look like a nice man, so everything is fine too. The Beits, owners of Russborrough House, made their living exploiting "darkies" to dig diamonds. So you can steal an invaluable art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Garda kills her ferrets and is involved in her murder. Moral equivalence is disgusting, Boorman is looking for a blockbuster movie, but does not have the courage to resist the crime of the generals' gang, which was terrorizing the neighborhood and launching a new wave of bullshit over Dublin. He even liaised with the generals' son by returning him. Repugnant. Shame on him for his cowardice.
