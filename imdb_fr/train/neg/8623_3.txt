This film tells the story of a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company led by Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever the cop's plans, the thief knows them in advance. This film, covered by beautiful actors, a beautiful leading actress and good shots of scenes from Hong Kong taken on camera, has no substance. Everything is flash and the flash quickly becomes boring. I lost all my interests to the third of the film and there is no redeemable quality thereafter, with the exception of cinematography, which looks good. Only consider this film if you can do it for free. In addition, remember to stop watching the movie 20 minutes after the beginning of the movie, because it's the same until the end: BORING. 6/10
