I did not have huge expectations for this movie when I rented it at the video store for $ 1, but at least the box showed a little promise with its "deadly cut" of "more gore!" More sex! " You can not go wrong there! Well ... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How in the hades of actors and actresses of this caliber they engaged in such a low film? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunk student coming out of the fraternity or another building like this and saying crap useless to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her . Then she is chased by a guy with a transparent plastic mask and seized by another. They cut her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a pencil. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same theme of the girl being pursued. / brutally killed by two guys for about 84 minutes more. Add in a stroke of tit. It's Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had a problem with this movie if the box did not encourage me to rent the movie. If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A frontal shot in 85 minutes of a chick that is clearly androgynous and bloody that would not scare a child does not cut it. If it's the Killer Cup, what's the theatrical cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually thrown into the theaters. Shame on the actors of this film. I could see them debut on the screen here because they had not done anything before, but they were all established before the release of this one. I do not know if the film was shot before their creation and the studio sat on the movie until they became big names or not. But what I want to know is ... they really spent $ 14 million for this movie ?!
