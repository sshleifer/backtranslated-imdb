Maiden Voyage, that's it. I would like to say right away that I watched 5 minutes before I could bear it anymore. As already mentioned in another comment, this film is not part of the whole "so bad that it's good", it's just bad. The acting is awful, the SFX are poor and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras are void, the "guardians of the bag" and others seem to hold their weapons like water guns. <br /> <br /> Do not even worry about watching this movie, the only thing about it is special, As your expectations are low, you will always be disappointed.
