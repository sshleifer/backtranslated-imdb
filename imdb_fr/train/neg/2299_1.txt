Before you begin, let me tell you that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay now that it's out of the way, I just want to say what do these morons who call themselves "hosts" think they do? - The last time I checked an animator, it does not discriminate, do not spew hatred on TV and do not try to convey its own beliefs to every unhappy soul who ventures onto the channel. Among them, Pat Robertson, Fred Phelps's love, is crazy every day. I'm all for freedom of speech, but since when does this cover a guy who says pretty much that if you venture out of his ideal lifestyle, you're immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOOO's many problems. One day, in my class, we had a substitute teacher and so we decided to watch TV, the teaching giving us no work. And we (against many of us) looked at the club of 700, and of course, that idiot Pat was talking about the Bible, and he said Simon said, "God says homosexuality is a sin "and I heard a child go" Hmm I guess he's right. " WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people believe that another person's sexual orientation is a huge sin, they must take that host, tape it and throw it away from the cruise liner in the middle of the Arctic.
