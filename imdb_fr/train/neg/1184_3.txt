this film had a pretty good plot, but the dough was very slow ... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks it's a cult classic, I think there are many of the best movies of this era to see. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are OK. turn on OK. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone other than a film student. <br /> <br /> the movie does not contain music and the horses have sex do not make a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was completely stupid. <br /> <br /> no winnings here, avoid this total boredom. I have seen worse believe me, but it's just a waste of time, and I do not get the good reviews here. especially the high notes ...
