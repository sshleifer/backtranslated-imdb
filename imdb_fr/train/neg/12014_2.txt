A tricky mystery of espionage with a predictable conspiracy about the dangers of the Second World War The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best acting game is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned demonic. He is at the head of a network of spies seeking information from Jane Amnesic, coded information related to the activities of allies. Will she say it? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is a convincing accomplice of Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. It seems so bad to hear that the cast must be ranked among the worst in the history of cinema. It is unfortunate that such a talented actor is placed in a role that does not suit his talents. The film deserves a look, although it is a half-spy, half-gangster movie, and despite a parade of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget this one, amnesia is not necessary.
