This grainy film has a cult and one of those word-of-mouth features to see absolutely. Hard to believe, but Fouke, a rural community in southwestern Arkansas, knows the legend is true. This story is told in a documentary style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places discussing with the people concerned. The legend changes with the narrative, but in the late 1960s and in most of the 1970s, Fouke was visited by a creature resembling Bigfoot along Boggy Creek. Long-limbed with three toes and standing more than 7 feet tall, this shaggy creature caused periodic damage and scared the bejeebers of most of the community. I personally crossed the little Boggy Creek Bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of the neck stood up. Of course, it was about 1 hour in the rain. When I arrived in Shreveport, I laughed.
