I hate to be the one who will rain on a parade (even a kid like this one), but from the very first scene, you could say that this movie was going to be an absolute shit. It's a shame, because I really like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued by the way they would mix in a movie, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat this - The two main actors (who stand side by side on the advertising posters and DVD jackets) did not have a scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. Pretty much sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, each character of the film was unrealistic and unhuman. The scenarios were wacky, the plot was shit, the jokes were thin, Freeman was trying too much to be funny (and played a poor Tim man from the office), nobody was friendly, and worst of all, some The characters were so boring that it almost drove me off, because I could not stand watching them or listening to them any longer. <br /> <br /> This low-budget stinker was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could not add humor and charm to that, but luckily he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> It is impossible for me to qualify this movie as "ten stars". Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I will not even give away some of the top ten stars, because ten means that a movie is perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which meant it was almost completely sinister. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you want, but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched great movies, your opinion will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
