One of the major flaws of this film is that, while mocking the pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it does not realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be ridiculed. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is the pretentious misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and focuses instead on their misunderstandings of the kitchen, I find it ironic that only the people who love this movie boast in movies the same vain taste that the characters choose for dinner. If these pompous characters featured in this film have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
