THE LAMPON NATIONAL CLASS MEETING was a failure when it was released. He did not stay long in the theaters of my big city. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully funny tone. Most of the actors were unknown at the time and remained unknown after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is excellent (a parody of slasher), but the execution is sorely lacking in every respect. <br /> <br /> Avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than spending a nanosecond looking at this embarrassing misfire.
