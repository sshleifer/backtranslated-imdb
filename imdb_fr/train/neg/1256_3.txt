This film is another attempt by director Tim Burton to capitalize on a familiar title to present his "vision" on the screen. He did it with Batman, Sleepy Hollow and now. This is not a remake. The only thing he has in common with the original is that he has simians who can talk (and Charleton Heston makes a monochrome). Burton reconstructed the whole story by softening it for the general public. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. In the 1960s, America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a hectic period of digging and revising social norms. It was the era of civil rights where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equals. In this context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil facing the audience of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that tackled difficult questions and elegantly subjected the oppressions of American society to scrutiny by ensuring that the white man justified his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought to provoke and be intelligent with subtle and obvious ironies. <br /> The Burton version is just as much a product of the current times as POTA was from the sixties. It's monkeys for dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting intelligent dialogues for politically correct platitudes and emphasizing form rather than substance. The end "surprise" is totally incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that installs the sequel. While the end of the original POTA tied everything together in one powerful scene, Burton's end just makes fun of the audience: "I know something you do not know and you'll have to wait for the sequel to find out. . '<br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camera is remarkable (although I still do not like his dark eyes). However, thirty-three years of advances in the fabrication of prostheses can not compensate for the insulting vacuum scenario. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans gathered behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous monkeys, aided and abetted by some turners (including Helena Bonham Carter in the role of Ari). The presentation is stereotyped and simplistic with a lot of violence, perfect for the modern fast-food mentality. <br /> <br /> The acting game is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor who is simply wrong in this role. Walberg is excellent for playing dark, sullen, tormented but strong characters. This part requires an inspiring hero, a profile that does not feature in the Wahlberg repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far from his abilities that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the fragile character, but her interpretation is a cross between a peace demonstrator at the university and a teenage boy in love. <br /> <br /> Then there is Tim Roth. It's a virtuoso performance, saving the film of total ruin on its own. Roth is devilishly hateful as a malevolent general Thade. He creates one of the most naughty and despicable villains I can remember in a while. In addition, his physical play is superb, making a chimpanzee so perfect that one can almost believe that the species exists. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. It's a decent entertainment, provided you check your brain at the door. I rated it 3/10. From a technical point of view, it's much better than that, maybe a 9/10. However, the story is an insult to the original franchise. It's just another attempt by Burton to be loved, using a familiar title to draw the crowds to the box office so that many people can see how he is a genius. Of course, that's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of a simple paper in mind formulated for mass consumption.
