I watched this movie recently on DVD and I must say that I was not impressed. I know it's taboo to hit independent movies, but this one seemed devoid of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The principle was interesting, but its execution did not succeed. I found myself thinking, "Okay, they start it, the story will soon resume." Before I knew it, the movie was over and the story had never been back. I can not say that I found the acting game so impressive. It was not bad. Not a trilogy before the Star Wars as bad, but a bad one anyway. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the time, I'll assume two hours (because it's a reliable estimate). Anyway, once the film was finished, I felt that I deserved a kind of recognition of the will I exercised not to stop the film and to start again halfway. and finally bored of my minds. I'm not one of those who need quick action and explosions in a movie, so do not start taking me for that, that's a reason not to like it.
