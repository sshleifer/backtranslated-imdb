Kim Basinger plays the role of Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who has problems while she is at the local mall for last-minute Christmas shopping. After placing a hateful hand scribbled on a piece of paper and sticking it in the windshield of a car occupying two parking spaces, she discovers that the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition, consisting of a white man, Mexican, a Chinese and a Black. They confront her about the ticket, block a helpless security guard and the lawsuit is opened. During the film, Della will go hunting for the hunter as she releases her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I discovered that it was a little thriller a little tense. The acting was pretty good (except for some scenes, the song "Why God why" was quite worthy of the name) It is a little defeated because the villains chased by Della are incredibly stupid. If they had not had the intelligence of a nasty "Home Alone", maybe their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the reaction it evokes. The incredible factor that I am willing to neglect since the director and one of the producers played a role in the screening of "Shoot em up" on the screen (a film that, while throwing credibility by the window, was extremely fun). This film, though never reaching the peaks of this film, was good for its own rights. <br /> <br /> My Note: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Anchor Bay Supplements: Commentary with screenwriter Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a "making-of" of 25 minutes and a half; a trailer and two TV spots for this film; and trailer for Lower Learning
