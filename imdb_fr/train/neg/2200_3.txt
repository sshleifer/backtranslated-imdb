I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh hysterically about them. and the scifi chain organized a marathon, culminating in the premiere of their new original image, hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the glimpses, it seemed like it was going to be extremely fun. basically a remake of the benchley creature, really. it was prefaced by a projection of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is the hilarity of the shark film at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to leave. bring it, man-hammer-scientist-man! Oh, my god, was this movie wrong? <br /> <br /> fake, fake, fake. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is a theoretical reproduction at its worst, my friends. When a drugged girl comes out of the suspended animation and is tied to a screaming table, because the shark-human hybrid fetus, the completely crazy "scientist" deliberately implanted in her belly wants OUT ... Monkeys. that's what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> it's really how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks do not succumb to cancer and other hammerhead sharks reproduce via the placenta . Oh look! a perfect amphibian being! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's make it happen! but damn good if all these shark genes have not made my son thirsty for blood; instead of violating the hot girls that I continue to send to his little paradise in the jungle, he continues to eat it. but look at this! among the random people who ended up on my research island, following an unimportant plot, is the woman to whom my son was engaged before his death! I bet he will do it! all this leads to an extremely touching and sincere meeting: woman: are you going to immerse me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates a shark-beating in a tank) what sweetness. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. already.
