A comedy without spirit, led without spirit, supposedly parodying the "classic" films of the "50s", "Alien Invasion", but which is really not better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup ). And any parody that is worse than its target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" are worse than almost every James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the strident voices of the aliens, you will ask for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
