I would not normally write a comment online, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed as a series of soap operas ("Young and Agitated" is really professionally filmed compared to that), but it also has terrible cuts. There is no action. It is full of unnecessary waste. <br /> <br /> Here is an example: a guy wants to kill the main character while he gets fired because of him. So (after lots of shit) here they are: the guy puts a knife to his throat and says something like "You're dead now". Then the main character says, "If you kill me, you're dead, I told the police you threatened me." Then the guy (the killer) goes (about to cry): "Oh no ... the cops follow me !? !! Oh ... my God." <br /> <br /> Remember, this is just an example. I really can not believe that this movie really exists. So: if you want to see the worst movie of my life ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
