It's not quite in the depths of Creepshow 3, but it's getting close to it. He also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in several roles throughout the anthology, which is embarrassing to say the least. <br /> <br /> It is also rather irritating to tear The Twilight Zone (the library is comparable to the late gallery of Serling). Unfortunately, producers and writers have forgotten that Serling would arouse sympathy for his characters before messing them up. None of the characters were particularly nice or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Decisive story: Adam West is ... well, himself. He is not going down the Bruce Wayne / Batman 60's path, but he rarely does. He simply plays the "Jay" which is not particularly enigmatic (there is a scary name that scares the spine and resembles that of Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper), and makes slightly embarrassing / scary statements. <br /> Abernathy: Did you see Rod Serling "A stop in Willoughby"? Then you saw that. The nutso woman's red herring is presented without any purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies it as a wimp. As well directed as one would expect, but fundamentally inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: A recollection of various stories of Serling's time travel, mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds". Most of the actors are not too bad (with the exception of Josh Astin in the role of Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even to breathe awkwardly), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, it's not going anywhere. The main character raises relatively reasonable issues, bugs (who would not?) And, for some reason, he will end up being banned in a nuclear desert. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: It's not a bad piece. and manages to precede Click and Creepshow 3. I guess this indicates that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. The main character is slightly friendly. Nothing really innovative here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Fighter Spirit: You see the turn coming, but as the main character, he has heart and a decent history of defeat and redemption. <BR /> <br /> Finale: So ... why do people end up in cold rooms in silver cutters? I do not know And does not make sense. So ... all the protagonists wandered around the bookstore and got trapped? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks guys!), And the guy from the first segment is dead. So how did he get trapped? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, got trapped and ... is not dead? What? Huh? I guess it's not supposed to make sense because it's supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not so different from the two most recent Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and some of the second are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
