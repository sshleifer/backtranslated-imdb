This film actually succeeds in being a stupid pleasure during the 2/3 of the trip. Unfortunately, the film ends up being too "confused". Although I know that some of the plots of the plot are classic in the movies of "police mates", I let myself be seduced by the characters who are brilliantly thwarted, but in the end, the film relies too much on sequences of pursuit like a crutch and I lost interest. <Br/> <br /> Filmmakers have been very successful at getting the characters alone and playing their own roles. We could quickly see who they were and identify them with the two policemen. We made our own opinion instead of being force-fed by incessant quarrels. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is too much to do and it hurts a lot of what could have been a good escape. . This is Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate affairs 2. His affair with a radio medium 3. Internal investigations on him are the subject of investigation. 4. Homicide Investigation <br /> <br /> If you consider Casey's concerns, he likes being an actor and taking revenge. the death of his father. Now, some of these things are fine and going well together, but all the elements of the plot come together in this false, long and pathetic pursuit that I barely have time to break my boredom and give a shit to this that just happened. Impressive screenplay acrobatics can not defeat bad movies. <br /> <br /> As if a ridiculous chase sequence was not bad enough, a sequence of four separate sections lasting up to half an hour was not enough. Joe Gavilan answers calls about his real estate contract while suing the author with a gun. All these out-of-school intrigues and jokes do not tell me anything, whether the criminal gets caught or not. We have already forgotten or are no longer interested in murderous conspiracy at this point, because multiple intrigues and the pleasure of prosecution have numbed us beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> While I could continue to talk about lawsuits and they ruin a decent story, I will not do it. It could have been a very nice formula, but it became too big for its britches and it became a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have done pretty well and a little appearance of Gladys Knight is worth noting. Unfortunately, none of the actors can prevent this desperately lost film from being forgotten. <br /> <br /> This film will probably be better than "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II", which do not do it yet. good movie. I've already heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that they thought would bring in money, I do not know if it's true or not. What is true is that to get good results at the box office, there is no need for a good movie or a good actor, this movie has none of the main roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: stay at Indiana Jones, because at least you can still run.
