This is the film that embodies the fear of D & D of the 80s (and even today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other role play) are "sucked up" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill, child sacrifice, suicide , etc.). An excellent film for anyone who likes to blame societal problems for inanimate objects, but those who have played a role play, a video game or even played in a play will see it as an insult to their intelligence. It's up to D & D what Wargames was to computers. Also, as a movie, it sucks a bit.
