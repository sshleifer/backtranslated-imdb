Do you remember a movie you used to like in the past that does not really fit the same feelings as an adult? It came to my mind when I went back to school. The National Lampoon Class Meeting. The film has an ideal opportunity to laugh, but surprisingly, it wanders aimlessly as we see a strange collection of characters such as a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can fire fire from her mouth, a man who seems to be a vampire. and a crazy killer dressed as a woman and carrying bags on her head. You have the class president who thinks he's the best thing since sliced ​​bread (but as we see in the movie, he's a coward and a joke), a couple of smokers who do not even know they're at their own class meeting, and a man named Gary, who is known to exist (no one can remember his name, that's the one I liked). There is a chubby pervert who likes to catch women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman screaming shouting when she calls her dog, and the cook (you know her from "Goonies" and "Throw Mama From The Train ") who likes to put food on people's plates with his hands! The film is essentially about a crazy guy who (or at least trying to) get revenge on his classmates for a gag they shot him (they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!) . The film follows the characters in search of the killer who conceals the dark and broken hallways of the old high school. His psychologist told them about the murderer who himself seems a little weird. The film has some good gags that work (soon enough), but the film slowly worsens every minute that passes. The real problem of the film is that it really does not know where to go. The movie is pretty much a joke because it has an uninsured direction ... if it really has a direction at all. The actors are quite enthusiastic, but the material they will make funny just does not have the quality to hold any interest. This is a curiosity for fans of comedy relics of the early 80s who are forgotten (this one rightly).
