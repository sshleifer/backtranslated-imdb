What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" that they used the word F a lot in this movie - like every other sentence. I did not like this movie at all - too much clue about sexual perversion, sidelines and cheating. And this swear was totally out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points are for the sexy movements of Mira Sorvino on the dance floor.
