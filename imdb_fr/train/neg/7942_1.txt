Really. Is not there a week when Oprah does not remind us that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> It is the center of every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not help but comment on answering all the questions she asks. She often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to dismiss her own story or anecdote. Administrators are obviously instructed to focus on their close-up reaction rather than on the faces of the guests, because that's what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always a question of Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says, "I'm sorry for myself, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my fight with my weight. Feel my pain when I turned away from a luxury store after they closed. Feel good to buy my magazines and books. Feel good for my success Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good. Feel good to make me rich beyond belief. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of his point of view: YOU, THE VISITORS, YOU ARE DEEPLY AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life even if I have nothing in common with you, plebs. I have never been married and I do not want to be married. I never had to raise a family - but I know everything about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me to others - witness "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend but we are not homosexuals. <br /> <br /> As of 31/07/2006, the header of its website reads as follows: "Oprah.com is your main source of information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, mind and health ". How presumptive and heinous is it? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she participated in two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect footage of her September 2006 shows. She continues to promise to leave the television, but her party is not going away. not announce. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess, nor a personal mission of God. She is just a very lucky, overweight black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it his own. She was in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to get the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. Barnum of this age and it surprises me that people can not see through his facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too, Oprah, if you can get that swollen ego through the door - here's the way to the big exit ...
