This nauseating excuse for television is the most horrible waste of all time ever on Australian television. Companions are dull, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are chosen for the reason that you would be likely to want to murder them if you were to live with them. As far as I am concerned, Big Brother is the decline of Western society, which shows how our society is on the verge of becoming a mortal jerk. What happened on television without aiming at the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? It can not be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can suppress your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and who, when transferred to Channel 10, became horribly malunous. With the exception of The Simpsons, who is extremely intelligent.
