This movie is really bad. The acting is simply horrible except for Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc gangs. He comes to a city and he is suddenly chosen to fight the bad guys who want the Indian land. On the cover, it was stated that he himself was an Indian, who had also returned to his hometown. I did not hear that in the movie. If so, it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines love too. And we would not talk about Sean Young, she was none of my favorite actors but in this movie, she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is awful. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because Michael Ironside was part of the cast. I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not see it unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will soon strike the list of actors because I have it at home. I wrote it after watching the movie.
