At the beginning of this film, an afternoon when I was at home with a touch of flu, otherwise I would have missed. It probably would have been better. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - two very good interpreters - and I thought it was worth looking at. This has proven to a certain extent, but only because it is one of those horror stories so fascinating. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents except for Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson. breast. Unfortunately, his acting prowess - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis by comparison. <br /> <br /> The white rat of the young nut case, the cat of the owner, the case of the young nut case having been expelled and restrained in his own home, and a pile of doophus (including the young case nuts) run around a bio risk facility, and the conclusion absurd. I was waiting for at least one element of the scene or plot that contained at least a minimum of realism, credibility, or the ability to evoke a certain empathy / sympathy - but it turned out to be futile.
