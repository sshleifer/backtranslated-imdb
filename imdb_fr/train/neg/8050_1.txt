what just below the surface is what? A simply horrible film, what is it? As other viewers rightly commented, the sequences of the storm are simply ridiculous. cut firewood already soggy in heavy rain? now it's smart. threat? presentiment? sexual tension? for those who read dull & artificial, dull & artificial and dull & too artificial. <br /> <br /> I want to thank my God for the shower scene of mia sara but, in hindsight, I think the producers of the movie Mess realized that they had to put something in for that to be worth it the trouble. then it becomes just another device. do yourself a favor and give him a miss.
