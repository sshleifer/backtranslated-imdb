Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; Partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which a character claims to define as optional memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hope of restoring his life. An obnoxious mixture very vaguely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 under the title "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too racy for television - with the addition of drugs and hippies - that NBC initially refused to broadcast it, so this small budget found itself in the theaters. Director James Goldstone begins to panic with hyperkinetic visuals and camera turns, while publisher Edward A. Biery unleashes zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, their brightly colored gimmicks can not hide the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the acting is unfortunately too mature. Dillman, under pressure to recall the events of the night in question, attends a seminar of actors composed of tics, stuttering, scraping nose and half-laughs crazy spitting a dialogue of the type "Dream ... Dream ... Drugs ... yeah, drugs ... that SOUND ... bells ... help! "Pat Hingle, almost a naughty Cheshire cat-smile scientist, almost eclipses Dillman's role in the department of Grand Thespian continually addressing everyone in a gossip, strutting like a mature peacock writhing in pain. The scientist / love-interest of Hope Lange receives a brief comment, but not before shouting to indifferent amateur Dillman: "What should I do, talk to Ape Man? I want you!" This is a frenzied "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 of ****
