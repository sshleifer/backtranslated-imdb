Let's face it: If you rent a STDVD suite of a forgotten 80s jewel and you expect it to be better than the one above, you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of useless suites that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this do not need spoilers because YOU already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of this "movie" is: Nerd meets girl; the girl likes the nerd; nerd loves girl; nerd is accidentally involved with a government Top Secret computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government lawsuits in the other country; nerd and girl meet an important old man who dies at a key moment in the "film"; nerd and girl are captured; the top secret government computer goes crazy; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret computer from the first "movie" Wargames; nerd saves the day; nerd is sending in the air. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> The acting, the scenario, the effects, the score and the cinematography are what you expect - B-grade. Some familiar faces are here, and unless you're a mega fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid this one. Of course, the movie will not make you crazy enough to see it yourself, so if you like cheap STDVD suites, you're at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was too involved in a "masterpiece", that he could not even make a five-second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?
