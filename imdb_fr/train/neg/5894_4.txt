How many centuries will it go until the Japanese / Asian horror movies give up the long-haired ghost woman shtick? Admittedly, they have managed to rip off "Ringu" a million times, and this has often worked well - which proves that originality is not a horror-like requirement (or that I am very critical and easy to please ?). However, this time, I found myself a little agitated, somewhat bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror movies, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Moreover, the end is confusing: it makes no sense. As for the ringtone: Miike could have proposed a more effective melody than this little forgotten thing. Even though it has been played a dozen times, I do not even remember it - that's how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, for him it is a commercial enterprise. Therefore, if someone thinks he is being perverted by the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" type, he is wasting his time.
