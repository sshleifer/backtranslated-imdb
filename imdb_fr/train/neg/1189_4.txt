The "bubbling" sound effect of the show was used to fall asleep. A very soothing show. I think I may have slept in places where there was danger or danger. I had also heard that some preparations for a sponge diver program had been made in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I guess Lloyd Bridges has never been diving there. I only remember the broadcast series and, although it was never exciting, we would create our own underwater episodes in the lake, at my grandmother's ... imagining the resonant sounds and telling our adventures in our heads. I thought Flipper had a better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
