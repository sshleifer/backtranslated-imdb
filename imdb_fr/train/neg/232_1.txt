It must have been one of the worst movies of all time. When Kate arrives and Jed is with a group of guys, they all start to applaud ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene occurred when Kate ran her hand on the sidewalk, it appeared that she was examining the texture of the sidewalk. Andie's role is so bad in this film - I could not communicate with them or feel their love for each other. The other 2 women were however very good and eclipsed Andie. Anyway, it was such a campy movie. I usually like this type of movies but I just could not get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again, Andie's game did not help the film. In addition, she is all gums. Lanc√¥me must put on makeup with a putty knife because it looks glamorous in commercial films.
