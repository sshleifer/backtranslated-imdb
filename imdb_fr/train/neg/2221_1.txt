I'm sorry, but that may have been scary in 1978, but modern times just do not fit. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister Judith with her Halloween mask. The most surprising moment of all the film is when his parents tore the mask to see their son killed their daughter. The film deteriorates from there and does not start until the last fifteen minutes, but at that moment, it is too late, we, the public, have lost interest in the story. There is virtually no character development, and people admit that Laurie is such an exceptional heroine, so she does not have much to say. I'm sorry I do not agree with anyone who is terrified of this movie, but if you want a big horror movie, check out The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is definitely not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because this film would never deserve such a high score.
