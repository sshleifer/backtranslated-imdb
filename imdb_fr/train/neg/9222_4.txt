I love the action and science fiction movies of the 60's and those associated with it because of the actresses who appeared there. They found the sexiest women in these movies and it did not matter if they could play the main role (remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed by this movie is that it was not nostalgic enough. The story of the film is a European science fiction film called "Dragonfly" and the director is fired. The producers decide to let a young filmmaker in the making (Jeremy Davies) complete the picture. They are a very beautiful woman in the movie who plays Dragonfly, but she is barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his father's exploits since his debut and puts them in the script. I hope the film could have been a tribute to these first films. They could have a lot of cameos by actors who appeared in them. There is an actor in this movie that was popular since the sixties and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I guess I'll have to keep waiting for a director to pay a fine tribute to the movies of the sixties. If anyone reads this, "Make it as sexy as possible"! I'll wait!
