This film is an abomination and its realization should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of making a film is why no one has ever made a film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It is a tale of a truly striking mystery, a beautiful old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the manufacturers have to change Richard Gordon, a policeman from Scotland Yard, into an amateur detective, to present the silly role and caricature of his English servant, to change the part of the main scenario concerning the murder charge and the circumstances of the fight Gordon to save the accused, etc.? Those producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the book should write the original script themselves and not violate another person's product.
