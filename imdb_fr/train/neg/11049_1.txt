If Mr. Cranky had noted it, I would be tempted to copy his comment and paste it here. But since he did not do it, I will have to try myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's game is excellent. However, even he can not save this film from disaster. The director had to be really distracted when he worked on it, because it is only a set of scenes assembled with very little continuity, reminiscent of the bad movies of the 70s. Worse still, the actors and the director seemed to invent the thread of the film, which probably shows how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth discussing the narrative, even if it revolves around a futuristic scenario. company called Proxate Corporation which has assembled a team of people needed to transport dangerous cargo on an old container / slave ship in Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a baby kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew members via USB 12 or something of the sort. The company should have been called Prostate Corporation, because the entertainment value of this film is comparable to an examination of the same name. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not find any scene that suits me. makes and makes sense in the context of the film. I only watched until the end when I had a bit bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people who were really worse off than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not blame him because he is a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad film of his career and this one is a doosie. <br /> <br /> So unless it's the only movie that If you're a man and you're a doctor, you do not do prostate exams this week and you think that's a bad thing, so give yourself a large place unless, of course, if you're really interested in the community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a coaster drink.
