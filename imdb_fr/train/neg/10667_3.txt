Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are only extra glorified. Their scenes were probably filmed in a day or two. Whatever their motives for being in this film, if you have an actor like James Woods, you'd better use it. For me, it's a sign of wrong direction through and through. The plot itself was not so bad. And the role of most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. was, however, terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since it was a serious movie, it can not be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting. Once again, better direction was needed. Plus, the pace was bad for a movie like this. It took almost half an hour to the main character to get into action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes, it's way too slow. The only factor that redeems is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make everything work. Too bad the director leaves her suspended. Yes, this film could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to succeed. And for an action / cascade coordinator of its caliber, you expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with this one. To avoid!
