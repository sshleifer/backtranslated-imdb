Ahh, the dull t.v. shows and the drivers that were slammed together in the 70s to make movies t.v. Some examples would be Riding With Death (the most hysterical of the lot), Stranded in Space, San Francisco International (horribly dull and incredibly confusing) and this glamorous piece of glamor Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Hawaii (although you do not know it from outside shots), it seems like a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the drab Diamond Head main character, who seemed half-asleep throughout the movie; her boss 'aunt Mary', who had a very strange delivery of her lines and white hair in the shape of a shell, as well as a tan that seemed to have been covered with stucco; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / coworker (damn it, I do not even remember her name), a skinny wooden woman with a flat talk that is neither sexy nor interesting; and the singer Zulu (again, I can not remember the name of his character) who was not naughty in small doses. The most interesting person of all the production was Ian McShane, who was a smart man, but who nevertheless proved his worth. Despite the makeup tasks that this so-called "chameleon" used to dress up, it was just laughable. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal in the laboratory that had brought him to dress as a South American dictator and in general American. I do not care either. The plot was simply not interesting enough to hold your attention even ten minutes at a time, not to mention about an hour and a half. Just call this one - Hawaii Five No!
