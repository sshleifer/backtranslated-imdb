Despite the excellent spin-offs of future design, Asimov's clever premises and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this film does not meet expectations. Clich√©s go fast and well; (coming out of a recurring nightmare, a non-conformist policeman sees his badge revoked by a hardass lieutenant, enumerating others would spoil him - you can see the end at one kilometer). This film is also linked to a stage - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; What is supposed to be a global disaster never leaves a Chicago CGI obviously. The robots themselves are good at close-ups, but the "crowd" scenes look more like bad Disney - the CGI is exaggerated again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by crushing them, why do they need to inject "nanites"? You know it's an ugly movie when such stupid questions start bothering you before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly because of the perfectly predictable plot that could come from any action movie of the last forty years.
