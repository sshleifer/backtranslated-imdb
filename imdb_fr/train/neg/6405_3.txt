No real plot to it, just a series of short sketches featuring very old jokes. I laughed once or twice at first, much to my chagrin. But even at just 73 minutes, this movie is out of print, which is welcome before long and becomes obsolete and tedious (with nudity sprinkled here and there to keep you awake). Still as bad as this movie is (and it's pretty putrid), it's a comical gem compared to just about anything from Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Movie Date, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) Sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of tits, 3 shrubs, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer of this film; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi".
