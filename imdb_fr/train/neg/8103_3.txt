It may be one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do not care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's infiltrable; it's just that, like 99% of his work, he's pretentious and exhausted. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters seem to have his navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I read a lot of his works (even his realistic socialist poetry, it was really awful). I just do not understand what it is. The characteristics (like the self-absorption) of his novels make the reading exasperating. In a movie, all the things I do not like about Kundera have been magnified. Maybe I just missed something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe this is a DVD from the Criterion collection. This film is absolutely essential.
