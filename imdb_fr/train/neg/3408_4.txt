I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All the little kids want to go into space, right? Well, after seeing this, I was so scared of dying that I would 'accidentally' throw myself into space by a psychotic robot with a 'track' spirit. I did not know it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I guess it was my own version of the days when the radio program "War of the Worlds" made people panic. Thus, recently, I see this film again, realizing that my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix, was part of this film (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you that I laughed at dramatic roles and laughed even more at acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she's moving in slow motion, have you ever noticed that? I do not think that being in space makes you talk so slowly or that you think so slowly. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is knocked out by the oxygen tank and starts to float in the back when the security doors close. Little Max tries to attract him. Suddenly, we have a close-up on Max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
