There is an excellent reason for Edison to go straight to the video: she would have landed in the theaters with a thud that was falling apart. The film lasted too long and was dangerously boring. Just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had two spare days before their next movie), the villains are as laughable and the action almost as non-existent as the role of Justin Timberlake. I hate to hit the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not that bad ... but most of the time. I like the fact that LL Cool J has received what seems like a shot to be the leader. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always so cool (we can see him swallowing many times while singing the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to raise this film to three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good) . <BR/> <br /> When all is said and done, the ultimate mistake with this movie is that it is a banal and boring piece of poppycock pseudo-action that can not stop anyone from sleeping. He also fails to make anyone laugh at the characters. All in all, it's just boring. That being said, praise him when you have insomnia.
