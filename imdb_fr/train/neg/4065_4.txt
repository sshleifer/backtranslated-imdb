... through the antics of Eric Stanze. A not particularly talented director made a film not very good, and yet I found myself in front of the end credits, if only to see what will happen next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After capturing her (even if she came voluntarily) and threatening her to have sex (another event she was also willing to do), he reveals that he has kidnapped three men who have hurt him in the past. He decides to kill her (eh?) But is foiled and dies instead. The girl's mind is breaking (or something like that) and she is unleashed on the unlucky guys in the basement. <br /> <br /> Okay, the writing is null: it is long, loaded with words of ten cents and that's it. It's way too much. <br /> <br /> The acting is nothing: what minute, what game actors? <br /> <br /> Filming is bad: the video at home is pretty bad, but 20 minutes of graveyard images are just an insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... "budget" was the typing line. <br /> <br /> And yet, there was a charm to the thing. In the '70s, this kind of film came out in theaters with real budgets and talent, but not in our day. If you want to watch this kind of violent and sexually exploitive trash (do not lie, some of us do), that's all you'll have nowadays. <br /> <br /> Brief shots of hardcore in a sex scene, torture with feces, fun with axes, anal rape with a broom and a long shot of crazy chick masturbating with the same broomstick are some of the best items on the menu. <br /> <br /> This is not good and we will not remember it, but not since the height of Joe D'amato, people have made films like this one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
