This is going to be the most useless comment I've ever written, but I have to do it to warn you of the movie atrocity that "Freddy's Dead" represents. This is not only the worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but also the worst sequel of all time! It was boring, useless and almost deadless. The awful end 3-D and the exceptional achievements of CORNY enough to push this "film" in the ground. However, it does not stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible scenario and a number of cheese cameos, and you get yourself this damn bunch of guano! No wonder Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, made two post mortem appearances. I would do it too if I went out like this. This is a movie strictly for fans, do not look at our shame.
