The film has a good start, portraying an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and presents two very likeable secondary characters throughout the first half. But later, something happens and suddenly, Shannon turns into that bad second-hand girl and the film gets lost in its own context. The second half lacks charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad acting, a horrible plot and an even worse coordination of stunts. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose to be part of the Chechen Mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and clown Bruce, but his daughter overcame him, which made him even more embarrassed than the double played Bruce Lee at the time. I really believe that she can do a lot better than that and I hope she will participate in a better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are an avid fan of action and you do not care about quality, keep going and see this movie. I was personally looking forward to it but I have been terribly disappointed.
