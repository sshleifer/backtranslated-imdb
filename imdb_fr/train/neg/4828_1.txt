I took TRAN SCAN to the library and brought him home. We considered going on a trip in the east and thought it would give us an idea of ​​the situation. The movie was a total waste of time. If I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I see it costs $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD lasted 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride. I felt belly ache all over Canada as they turned in a fast curve with the movie. <br /> <br /> They probably shot a lot of filming about it and you would think they could have done it. makes a better product. If I did this project, I would provide more footage, pause on the signs to tell people where they were, and stay in places to see the landscape. To make a movie like this, it should be 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a whistling noise caused by an accelerated car sound, but could at least put some music on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good pan-Canadian film see the railrodder / National Film Board of Canada featuring Buster Keaton (one of the last films he has made) in this comic film Buster Keaton goes up at a railway station in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
