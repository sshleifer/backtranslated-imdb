Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still in agony after seeing it. It's so bad that one has to wonder how one could write this tripe, and even less allow it to be cowardly for the general public. A prominent actor who looks like a sleepwalker and Alison Eastwood herself embarrassed. The action is revealing of the making of low budget movies, which means that it is painfully bad. The parcel? Well, if you were 6, you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and lame.
