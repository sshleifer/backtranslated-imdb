This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1 so I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It starts funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the film is halfway through, it begins to slide and everything becomes skeptical. The characters in the office were delicious in the first third of the movie, but we know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. It's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, told here in slightly different circumstances. The problem is that I could endure another predictable love story if the dialogue was not so fixed! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had incoherent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully, this movie will soon be in the office of the movie Dead.
