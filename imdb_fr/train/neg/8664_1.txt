This is just a movie joke, they have already lost me to the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills another creature in his cage, this is watched by a scientist who works there on a monitor and guess what she does, well let go into the cage to check the stuff, omg how these idiots think humans are human beings, it's as if they were jumping into an aquarium with a great white shark because they were eating your goldfish ... Very useless and even dumber And I will not even talk about the distribution because they are not worth it. why they did not fire the guy who wrote this right now, it's a mystery to me ..... And that kind of dumb continues the whole movie. Only good thing if the CGI is better than average for these low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If these things do not bother you, go see it, but be warned if your IQ is above 60, you will probably hate it.
