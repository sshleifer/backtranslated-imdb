Seriously, why are American and French actors claiming to be Czechs to speak perfect English with a false Russian accent? I'm a man and so I enjoyed the free nudity - but a soft porn movie would have more, and at least not pretend it's artistic. All political statements were painfully didactic - has the director heard of subtlety? The acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. The characters were very superficial and I just could not relate to them. <br /> <br /> What made me laugh was when they cut the actors in archive footage of the Prague protests - and they were black and white, then sepia to match the sequence - all simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have read a lot of news about Kundera (and not the unbearable lightness of being), and his writing style has good things his themes are a great male fantasy) - and I must say that the film did NOT convey the kindness of the Kunderas style.
