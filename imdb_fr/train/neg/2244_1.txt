I must specify two points from the beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscars were REALLY this year. The Academy has shown people that they are not racist and have never been racist. They wanted to erase all preconceived ideas about themselves. Secondly, there is no need to comment on the series, because really, what difference will it make? But it's fun to write about it. It's the year I'm getting tired of the Oscars! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" then the real winner should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, look at it and you will agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" upon his release did not receive any candidacy. And as for this year, well, the bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann is not named "Best Director"! Are you kidding !! "A Beautiful Mind" is in place for "Best Makeup" ???? "Training Day" is named ?? The movie was awful, and it seemed like Washington had not even played in a performance. All he has proven is that he knows how to use four-letter words! That's why he won the prize! Take off the tongue and I bet he was playing almost alone! I really liked "Gosford Park", but why 7 nominations? And how on earth could they not give him too much Altman! I mean, let's go, if it's just about awarding the prize to people to dispel any negative feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years now and no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscars, but, I'm going to live with it, as long as I'll never have to watch another show again! The culmination (and the ONLY) of the series came when Woody Allen made his first appearance at the awards ceremony. This will remain one of the greatest moments in the history of the series.
