Wow, the scariest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. I will start by saying that I am not a fan of the episodes told. If the story / actors / etc. deserve to be salty, they should be able to convey the essence of the story without having to reread it, reminding me of characters who can not think of anything, but rely on tele-chapters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some like this sort of thing, it's just not my cup of tea. They could have kept the story, but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a journalist. Few negative things like the presence of Peugeot at home, which has a singular alley in a semicircle, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree under which he stood, because we do not see him anywhere on the road or on the property. Slippery editing, as she walks down the aisle (for what seems to be the hundredth time), who are exactly those 2 guys you see at 24:30 walking towards the car as she walks down the aisle of the deserted house? The dolly close-ups were also exaggerated, as a junior-level drama student discovered zooming on his camera for the first time. I could keep separating, but it could become almost as boring as this episode. It was ceaselessly dragging on and the real goal seemed to be to use absolutely all the footage they had taken from Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I was really expecting to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle while a voiceover would tell us about the 8-track player, the automatic top, and so on. The only good thing I have to say about this one is that it suddenly ends abruptly. No tips attached, nothing explained or finished. Few would have noticed, most had already changed channels or had fallen asleep at the end.
