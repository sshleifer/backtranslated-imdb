I do not know about you, but I have always been attracted by the 'ART' cinema. The first "artistic" film I managed to find was "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and His Lover", by Peter Greenaway, who blew up my mind and creative spirit. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... it is the object of "artistic cinema": to explore intellectual ideas and to bring visceral interest to the screen. Life, real life, may look like living in a madhouse, and the art expressed shows it well. I love movies of all types, but especially those who entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with his position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" It's a dry movie, a clinical "comedy" where a father and son gather a harem to answer their many sexual fantasies. The film only briefly mentions Fellini, as suggested by the previews. The film focuses mainly on the "close" father-son relationships that were formed after the mothers' deaths. In the first scenes of the film, the sadness of the fathers is credible, you can feel his pain. What happens next is clear by the criteria of Greenaway, the collection of the harem, observations on love and death, and the flesh displayed for reasons of flesh ... One could say the same, but I think the film is superficial and useless. And the idea that it could be a comedy leaves me puzzled. Most of the actors, if that's ok, ... are particularly good Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should put her clothes back on). What's missing from the movie is a fascinating story, and the slight touches of Greenaway excesses that made her other films so wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> While filled with moments of insight and occasional taboos, "8 1/2 Women" is too cut and pasted to be considered an art, too bland to be considered "funny" "and just too dull to be considered worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
