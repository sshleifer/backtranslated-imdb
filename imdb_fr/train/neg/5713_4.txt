There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and having an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> It's only my opinion, but a good thriller depends on the establishment of friendly and intelligent characters. As for sympathy, the protagonists of Say Yes are a picturesque married couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let us count the ways in which they manage badly to be terrorized by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you stay in when you drop him off. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the stalker's hell in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing him to lay charges of assault. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother talking about the stalker to the police and just assume (for no apparent reason) that the stalker has corrupted the cops. <br /> <br /> 4. When you try to escape, leave your wife as far away from sight as possible for the stalker to kidnap her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after the abduction of your wife, make sure you send him back as soon as possible so you can confront him in the lead -headed. No need to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect a person to be safe from a few mistakes in these stressful conditions, but Say Yes's characters are so dense and make so many mistakes incredible that it is actually impossible for the viewer to worry about their safety because they are victims of their own doing. It kills the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the writers did not stop at the tasteless character. Since they are themselves stupid to have written this crapfest, they decided to create situations so absurdly unrealistic that any sense of reality would disappear through the window. <br /> <br /> 1. The stalker kills a cop in a police station? while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet. <br /> <br /> 2. The harasser engages in all sorts of questionable activities in broad daylight and around many people, but only the married couple seems to notice his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The harasser survives an absurd violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The scenes of "suspense" had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct scams of American movies. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is decapitation at the end, a rather brutal scene since it was inflicted on the woman. It is unfortunate that the filmmakers followed a scandalously stupid end that goes out of the left field. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Koreans behind Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should simply move to California and work with people who make movies with similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
