The way this trash has been filmed is beyond me. The only actor I know is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence only serves to justify his staging. <br /> <br /> I do not even think it's worth being nominated for a price of rotten tomatoes, this movie really makes movies B a cinematic pleasure. A car traveling on the highway with the police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> The script must have been written on the back of a carton of cigarettes. Most TV movies are awful, but that redefines the word. Discover the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.
