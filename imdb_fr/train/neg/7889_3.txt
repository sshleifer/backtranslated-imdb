I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed. I do not really know why anyone would make a movie like this. It was slightly entertaining, but I feel that the people who created it had a lot of disagreements about what they were doing. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who takes the coffee; etc. It almost looks like they really wanted to make two different movies, but they only had the time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Someone else commented that the game was really good, but I would disagree. Again, if the actors managed to keep their face upright during the shoot, they may be better than I attribute to them. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film is a mystery ... something like a law and a historical order or a national treasure. It starts like this, but then, out of nowhere, it takes a turn towards a bad episode of Twilight Zone, or ... what was that other show that was not so good ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it's so played. There is the naughty guy with bristly white hair. There is the love interest which, when it first appears, the wind blows in her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it's a Christian movie, the end is also pretty easy to spot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poorly done, especially in opening scenes - a way to showcase your best foot. It was not dreadful for most of the movie, but there was sometimes the ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying with her arms up in a dark room as the lightning lit up - that sort of thing that you makes a little embarrassed look at the movie.
