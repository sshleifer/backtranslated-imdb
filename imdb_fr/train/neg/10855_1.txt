It's a comedy that I will probably not forget for a moment. <br /> <br /> I would not normally take the trouble to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would want to watch it anyway, but as it happens, it's a bit popular in the networks sharing p2p such as kazaa, and so this saaad production has to be exposed for what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it then? Of course, it's not really a comedy. instead, it is a horror movie - the key word being "intended". The scenario is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess. The special effects are only special in that they are particularly pathetic, and as far as acting is concerned, well, let's just say that if this had been my graduation piece in elementary school, my teachers of course understood that it was a film with a very small budget and that, in this case, it was necessary to lower expectations, especially with regard to special effects. Moreover, even though I am a big fan of the horror genre, I am aware that these films are rarely the place to look for interesting scripts and top-notch actors. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> B-series movies often have editorial features to compensate for lack of funding, such as humor. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear reside in ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor in that - and I could do it for the first 20 minutes or so, then gradually doze off - that's the only thing the film can offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's not even that she's not trying to convey anything: the victims are using drugs or are involved in serious crimes. The lesson: Be careful, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will have to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I leave my case in my favor. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a little sex, a lot of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. <br /> <br /> I note this 1 out of 10, but I would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I would not do it: it deserves a 1 to spell the names of the actors correctly in the titles. I mean, it's something, innit?
