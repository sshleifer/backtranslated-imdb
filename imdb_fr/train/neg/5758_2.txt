One could say that the actors will make a film, but this clearly proves that this statement is false. Most characters in this movie are not lacking in anything. They play the role of cardboard blanks moving in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. This could be summed up in a few words, but I will refrain in case anyone who reads would like to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to fast forward the parts where Jack showed us how odious eater. I must say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I would rather not spend my time watching Jack chew loudly with his mouth open. Personally, I could have passed me references to the shoes and jokes that enamel the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from my personal dementia, the film did not miss anything. There were countless scenes and shots that seemed dragging. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is better not to look at this one.
