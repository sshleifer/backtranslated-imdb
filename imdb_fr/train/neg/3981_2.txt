This film really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY incredible. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be trainees working in a mailroom for an Italian fashion company. But, for whatever reason, they are staying in a 5-star hotel (ideally located across from the Coliseum), and all the other trainees they work with look as unnatural as they are. One thing I found obvious in this movie is the way one of the twins does not end up with the guy. I guess they tried to distort their usual plot a bit. Good try.
