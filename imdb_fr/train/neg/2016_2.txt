***** Disclaimer: May contain spoiler ********* My huge problem with this movie is how completely egocentric and self-consuming the adulteress !! After spending a night with a gooey psychopath, she tracks him down. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is obviously crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks that it is dangerous for HER (and reveals her secret). Not a single second, she never thought of her husband! Has she even thought for a moment of his possible endangerment by this psychotic? As soon as she realized how mental he was, she should have warned her husband, no matter what the consequences. Maybe there was no movie then, but there was not really anyway, what's the difference?
