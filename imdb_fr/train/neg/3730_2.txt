First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making such a film to try to present the message of the Gospel. So, my scruples with this film are neither in its sincerity nor in its aspirations. As a Christian, even if he is amillenialist, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and that Christ will return as he said. So, even though I disagree with this film about the kidnapping, that's not why I rate this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me say that this film is so low is not its sincerity nor its message, but rather its lack of production values, its horrible scenario, its mediocre game and its pitiful effects. This film ranks there with some of the largest scifi fodder of the 1950s. No, this movie ranks there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not age well and was probably dated by the time they did a sequel. <br /> <br /> Producers of Apocalypse genre films could have learned not to make a movie of the end of time, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega Code series have not learned the lessons of this situation, because they solved the problems of exchange and look obsolete, but their scripts are always mediocre and their game is wooden . <br /> There are great Christian movies, with extremely low budgets, but this movie is not part of it. I am surprised that the crew of MST3K has never shouted this one.
