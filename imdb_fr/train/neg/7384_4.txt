EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is posted in France for a reconnaissance mission . as well as three new young recruits from the strike team after disobeying a direct order from above. However, the night before their strike, they are all slaughtered by a murderer with seemingly inhuman strength. As the French police conduct their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible, to discover a corrupt faction of the military that is dealing with a new lethal drug that is altering a person's DNA and giving it a terrifying new force. <Br /> <br /> Bad coverage. Bad title. Bad post-production alterations. And bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But, I must say, I do not think Attack Force is quite his worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most other reviews here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of the criticism comes from all the bad news that preceded the film rather than its quality even. I must say that there was nowhere as much dubbing or editing as I had been led to believe. The dubbing that was there (which made him look like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty awful and quite common but was not used for as big a segment of the movie as I thought. The plot went very well, considering the confusion with the original finished film called Harvester. In addition, as noted by another reviewer, the film has a beautiful Gothic appearance and brings a new touch to the Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> The most lethal point, however, was the total and exciting lack of exciting action. , with just a few badly filmed fight scenes for fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, however, I'd rather watch this than Flight of Fury, Today's Die or Out for a Kill. **
