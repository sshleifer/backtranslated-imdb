It was all that was not: there was rhythm, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the landscape. He also had a decent script. This one made me scratch my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why does he waste his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists", why do they sign up for The Mother of All Shows (like the movie "Brady Bunch" in which Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare, to find himself on BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not really hungry either. And while they knew the story was right (the poster had been published before Farrah had the show), Silverman was refusing the slots for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol". <br /> <br /> What bothered me was to distort Spelling's role. He is shown as the show runner and the creator when he was neither one nor the other. And how he "found" the idea "for CA" was laughable! <br /> <br /> How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why did not Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving, not because she discovered her inner diva, but because the majors wanted it? Therefore, when he tries to create conflict and tension by making Farrah the "bad girl" (as Suzanne Somers), he fails because the preparatory work has never been prepared - this is where the photo of "The Company of Three" has been delivered.
