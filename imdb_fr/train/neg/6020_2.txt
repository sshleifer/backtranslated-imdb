I like end-of-day movies. I like serial movies. I was hoping to like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the mediocre effects, the often atrocious music, the creaking lines. I could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the film is constantly based on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. I could ignore the fact that people who are fighting hunger and trying to achieve peace in the world are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's just boring. Nothing really happens; almost every scene in the film is designed to push the creators' morality on viewers, at the price of a consistent storyline or any kind of suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
