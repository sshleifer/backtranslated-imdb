I am a big fan of the comic book series, but this film fell well below my expectations. I was expecting Heavy Metal 2000 to feel a little bit in the hand ..... slow movement, bad dialogue, a lot of blood ..... but it was worse than anything I could have imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost identical to the comics, but the good points stop there. The characters do not have the energy or the spirit that caught my attention in the comic series. The film covers only a small part of the comic strip, and the part used is slower and boring than the following parts. The film focuses on insignificant events instead of the more interesting plot of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Unfortunately, it was not like that, so now there is another terrible movie that few people will see and let alone enjoy. My copy will surely pick up dust for years until I finally throw it away.
