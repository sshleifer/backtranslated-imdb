Oh, come on, we give this movie a break. The only thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh yes!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, bad movie, I was thinking of a better movie. Let me see now, I always try to defend him. Oh yes, Clueless's daughter was inside. Do not belittle Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But my boy, Stacy, you made a mistake. <br /> <br /> Hey, something that has never been done in a western casting, even female, actually suspended a woman at the gallows. This could be a western first. Even if her neck should have been broken and she survived the test, you still have to make an effort to stage the director. Also, I've never seen a woman lynched a horse in a western, although that did not happen in this movie, I just thought I'd give the director another idea of ​​Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after. Ed Wood Monster Bride # 2. Maybe that was what the filmmakers wanted. Orginality, especially with a cast of African women and an Eastern cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Héey, if the Gang Of Roses officials want to create a sequel to this mess, you could have such slang as "Hey, do not talk about my daughters at home" and "talk to the hand, baby, speaks by hand. "You can also have an assistant marshal guy type surfer who says things like:" This shootout was a TOTALLY RAD man, totally. " You know things like that.
