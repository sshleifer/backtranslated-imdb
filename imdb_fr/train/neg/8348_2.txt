I just watched "El Otro". I have always loved the performances of Julio Chavez, who is an excellent actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I guess it would have been worse if there had not been Julio. Anyway, this is certainly a movie you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this film in order to have a good time with your girlfriend, your friend, your family or your friends ... it's really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense either. The director probably wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is to wear and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I really did not like this movie.
