Totally forgettable. Especially because of the weak role. This is the first film I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, it's been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a newcomer because his acting was so bland. I could say as much about Liv Tyler. Although I saw her well in other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a personality as moving and moving as Diane Keaton could, but it was strange to see her say her words in a low voice. It seemed that overall there was just not a very good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton also felt it. She is a fantastic actress, but seemed a little exaggerated in this movie. It was as if she just wanted to finish this movie as soon as possible. I would not blame her.
