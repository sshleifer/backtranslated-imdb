This remake of the original 1962 film contains some very good elements to congratulate him as well as good performances by good actors - but Scorsese opts for the end of the most formulated twists in the plot and an embarrassing Shakespearian failure Look at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving all his work, but he needs a precise direction to direct his talent, which is sorely lacking in the last five years. the film. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is usable but nothing more while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this one. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte runs better performance than Lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as "weeds". Joe Don Baker has good points while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes jumps from one generation to the next. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The opening credits (!), The first view of Cody's back when diving in the prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden decent in full panic, Cody is calm, but annoying. <br /> The worst? The "housekeeper - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Hang your bare hands under a car on a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no speed bumps in the United States?) "He's dead - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" partS and the end mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I can watch the original again, but I'm not yet tempted to watch the remake in four years.
