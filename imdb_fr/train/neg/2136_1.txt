Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a film that attacked Republicans? Why do not they learn? Dixie chicks do not have. These left-handers live in their own elite bubble interacting with each other; forgetting the fact that most of the United States is far more right than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all. <br /> <br /> The imitation of Dan Akroyd Cheney was mean. <br /> <br /> I thought Cussack could have got better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
