You can call this one a flop, and it's a really big one too! The quality is not associated with the words "National Lampoon", but at least the "Vacation and Animal House" entries were fun, but this offer must be their most stupid feature so far I've seen. Ugh! The story in three episodes madly attempts to parody the clichés and stereotypes that have flooded Hollywood genre films, which turns out to be a completely ridiculous and rude dross. <br /> <br /> "Growing up oneself" - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decides to quit his job and separate from his wife so that both of them can grow up and do what they have always wanted to do. It's life, as Jason sees and cares for children, but his decision to follow this path may not be the right one. <br /> <br /> Talk about lead, boredom and hard. The small portrayal of the charming Diane Lane is only of interest. The satirical element seems to indicate something that is not just a performance. Silly humor is tense, flat and particularly foolish. Peter Riegert retains the lead role and Teresa Ganzel continues to play in her role. <br /> <br /> "Success Wanters" - After completing her collage, Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and gets raped with butter. by the presidents of the dairy companies. To save time, she is interested in the margarine industry and virtually goes to the "very" top. <br /> <br /> Probably the best of the three, but the competition was not too big. The gags seem to want to go more subtle with his sexual tone and power-oriented, but they always feel more sticky and forced. The idea had something promising and inventive to build, but the languid pace begins to fade in the end and a disastrous dialogue does the humor try, but most often does not go away, despite the hunger. The seductive Ann Dusenberry is quite cold and manipulative (well after the painful ordeal) and she likes to untie her gracefully. Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and Joe Spinell's favorite ride seem to be a fun training for the first half of the story. <br /> <br /> "Municipalians" - A serial The murderer who leaves copies of his driver's license after each murder is found by a naive and enthusiastic beginner police officer and his former ruffled partner. However, the young policeman learns that the only thing to do is to be firm when the couple is in a situation after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yes. Of course, if you want to imitate something extremely extreme, make sure that laughter will escape. Obviously they forgot that! Even after 30 minutes of racing, it trails! The grumpy performance of Robby Benson was rather dominant with a tired Richard Widmark, who does not make his partner very much. Christopher Lloyd underestimates the role of the serial killer, but his scary and friendly performance works well and highlights the other tracks well. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When the jokes arrive, they really feel out of sync and become rather obsolete with his repetition of making fun of those clichés of cops. <br /> <br /> Overall, the idiotic material with his sketches appears as disposable, and the unbearable script is fundamentally inept and unintelligent. Only one or two gags are enough for each segment, but in reality, there is too much candy in the cheap place or ordinary misfits that hold you in your head. It's because it becomes practically what you're trying to make fun of and it's basically seen in every story. He loses his sight. The performances go from hot to cold, but those who can not deny the discomfort felt on most faces. Director Giraldi's first taste is tasteless for "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" has shown some minor side effects of effectiveness. Henry Jaglom does a tiring job on the "Municipalians". Rick Meyerowitz's extremely gritty drawings that open the film have been carefully crafted and then define the style and mood. <br /> <br /> familiar cameos. But really, is it worth it to go through this frenzied and hectic outfit, just to spot them. Well, it's up to you to see.
