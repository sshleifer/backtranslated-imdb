Phew - I do not know what to say. It's a movie that could be really good with a group of stoned spectators. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' first offers. Maybe I should go back - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / narrator. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked that the lawyer takes for the clause "full faith and credibility". By the way, it's a "total faith"! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the writer, the director, the editor, etc. It is probably best to let highly experienced film professionals have technical skills (even if it is a stunt, some would say) to succeed in such a venture.
