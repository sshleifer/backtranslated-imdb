I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Much of the "historical facts" were inaccurate. At the beginning of the film, the grandfather told his grandson and his friends how they felt when September 11th struck. This film was scheduled to take place in 1994. One of the grandson's friends also wore an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He had not even been drafted yet. The scenario was good, but the facts and the reality of the calendar were so far apart that the movie looked corny. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and souvenirs from the Second World War. I rented this movie hoping it would be good. The game was really average. The dog was cute. But the way this film was made made me happy to have paid only $ 4 to rent, while it would have taken me to the movies. I hope that those who will never read this will understand that I do not mean to say that there is no dissatisfaction with those who fought the war, but the facts and the timetable should have been watched more closely.
