Not really a mess in my opinion, but I still wanted to cover myself. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the many nonsense of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie with an intentional indie impression, and just be absorbed by the mentor / be-all-you-you -can -be theme. He plays an alternate universe, a semi-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, which is driven in an old Econovan by a kid to Carson, Calif., From Brentwood, to look for his next role in the film. Why Carson, is a mystery for So. Residents of Cal. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and find the same elements. Paz Vega is pretty to look at, a mix between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a dissatisfied grocery checker on a large but slow local market that seems to be the ultimate source of Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known as "Him" to refer to the way actors are viewed when they are encountered in real life - "Psst, it's" him, "etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted because he had all kinds of mundane wisdom and advice, but had no reliable return home to Brentwood, had no money or debit card, nor had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with All he's doing, so I have to see some money and a Blackberry with intelligence and good instincts of survival to preserve that great ego he definitely has, nothing really happens in this movie changed by their meeting, he flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then this thought sparkles.For me, it looked like Shopgirl Steve Martin, no sexual history.It was complacent for Freeman and unconvincing for the public.
