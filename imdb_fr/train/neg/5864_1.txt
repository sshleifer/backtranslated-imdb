I'm pretty sure it's the worst movie of all time. If you can not make a 13-year-old boy laugh with silly humor, you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose different. The film is full of predictable gags (some racist) and jokes very funny. The scene where the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit is dead and is pregnant is particularly memorable (as I write this, I can not believe it was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctor's desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! DO NOT! The hitting line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should have been on top". ha ha ha ha ah uh ........
