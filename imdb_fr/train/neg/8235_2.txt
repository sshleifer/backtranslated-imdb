As horror fans, we all know that renting the blind is a shit. Sometimes we find a real gem, but often, we find that the film on which we have just spent our hard earned money is nothing more than a putrid steamboat aggravated by rave reviews and awards from totally undeserved movies listed on the box. This is the case of Five Across The Eyes (a title that I am sure is a double meaning that refers to the budget of the film and the constraint that the one who looks at it could have to use the five fingers to stab himself the eyes). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what the authors * ahem * think, is centered on a group of teenage girls who unwisely decide to go for a walk in the wild late at night after leaving a football match and ran a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a clash in a parking lot of a gas station . <br /> <br /> In all honesty, this is an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have a very simple story. It is in the performance of Five Across The Eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its bumpy camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its meticulous approach to the material, but fails to be neither. What we get instead are redundant scenes of prosecution, torture, liberation; chase the torture, release, in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of crap, groans and incoherent walks acting as a multitude of chase sequences between prosecutions. <br /> <br /> The film has an incredibly grainy and dark appearance, which, in a better quality film, could have reinforced the tension and realism. Here, it's just boring. The characters are not developed and the viewer has trouble finding anything that sympathizes. One of the characters stopped to pick up a first aid kit and scratch his face as gunshots in the background suggested that his friends might be killed. Another girl whispers hilarious and dumb lines like "Do not go out, she'll understand you, if she understands you, she'll kill you and if she kills you, you're dead." <br /> <br /> This is a reward from the magazine Fangoria and Dreadcentral.com written on the box that forced me to consult this one. You speak of a false orgasm! Maybe my expectations would have been met if it had been in the comedy section. I'm all for the low-budget independent horror, but this one is taking shit. Give a pass to Five Across the Eyes (or FATE, you get it?). <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 bar out of five /
