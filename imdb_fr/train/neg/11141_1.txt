Dude, this movie was really bad! I did not even manage to see the hole (my girlfriend did it). Really bad acting, computer animations so bad that you just laugh (woman to werewolf), strange clips, the list goes on and on. I do not know if it's just me or if this movie reminds you of a porn movie? And I'm not talking about all the naked women ... It's something about the light or something like that ... It could become a classic because of the bad acting and all the naked women, but not because it's a beautiful original twist film of the plot. My last words are: do not see it! It's not worth the time. If you want to see it because nudity, there are plenty of better ones to see!
