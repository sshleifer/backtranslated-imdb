Lets make a movie on an existing talk show and have everything that happens in the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, which should not be the case, stay away from the ringmaster. I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and being able to witness the disorder of a film. I guess jerry springer does not play himself, as shown by the cheap props of his show (yes, it seems even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he's only known as jerry in the film. The plot (if you can call it that) is about a girl who lives with her mother and decides to start sleeping with the mother's life in the boyfriend. The bright idea of ​​the mother is to call jerry springer's show and do it with her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, somewhere else in the United States, a woman finds her cheating man with her friend in bed together. So of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I'll talk about the rest of the movie, but thinking about the movie gives me a headache. Jamie Pressly who plays the girl looks totally unattractive in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff the master of karate kick ass of the American ninja series? Look at it now like a drunk white trash. The problem is that he really looks too horrible and distorted to call him "getting in touch with his character". But if your idea of ​​fun is to see Jerry Springer singing a country song about his own show or guys talking to transvestites ... well ... JUST WATCH THE SHOW! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this movie.
