I just spent four dollars renting this movie! Why would Atlantis Alliance want to promote such a bad excuse for a movie beyond me? But even more surprising were the rather good reviews that some critics of Canadian newspapers gave to this film. I am tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it is Canadian and low budget. It's like we're expecting Canadian films to be ugly, so they give a good review. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie: the acting was below average (except for the main character, which is pretty good). The quality of the film was mediocre, which, I suppose, could be expected from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the main characters, a drug trafficker who flirts with one of his clients to recruit him to repair and steal bicycles for his gang, whose sole purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Supposedly, many of the bikes of her gang members are destroyed during these activities (I do not know how she can not afford to buy new ones because she is supposed to be this big drug traffic from Vancouver in Toronto). <Br/> <br /> Anyway, the interest of the story (which will be revealed only half of the film) is that the drug dealer intends to build buildings to incendiary bombs in the Toronto area to try to make homes more affordable. we will want to live in the region. <br /> <br /> - Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a movie, Telefilm for supporting it, and The Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight Newspapers for giving such biased reviews. <br /> <br /> A movie should not be treated specially just because it's Canadian !!!!
