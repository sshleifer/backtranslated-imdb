Usually, I'm a little fan of the bad movies of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s, but this film is so horrible ... but this film is so terrible that it was a real test of endurance. The guys disguising themselves as girls were made to death - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was catastrophic, as usual, Nicole Eggert was hardly better. It has no quality, even if you are a fan actor / actress in this basket - stay away!
