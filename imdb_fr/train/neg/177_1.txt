If you plan to see this movie, please reconsider. In general, I do not post my comments about something I saw on TV, but this one was such a mess of my life that I had to do something productive to get rid of that bad taste . Criticizing this film would take too much time because there are so many things wrong with it. I'm just going to say, please, never see this movie. It was a total loss of time and it will be a loss on your part. Anyone who has written a positive review of this film is one of two things; totally inept, or working for the company that produced it. Once again, I guarantee you will really regret seeing this movie!
