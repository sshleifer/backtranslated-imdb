OK, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie. <br /> <br /> Your stereotypical teenagers are at home. We have an FBI agent who has seen Dirty Harry once again. "So what's the secret ... punks?" We had about 4 small shots and different scenes that make no sense. "Hey guy, I'm fixing sprinklers" ((this guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly, a preacher tied up on a couch watching movies, he's killed. Follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, without cops. she is suddenly in a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear it's the most stupid slasher movie I've ever seen.
